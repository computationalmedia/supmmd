In late 1998 the centrist government of Turkey led by Mesut Yilmaz collapsed in a
corruption scandal. President Demirel approached Recai Kutan, leader of a pro-Islamic
party with the most seats in parliament, to lead a new government. Kutan demurred
from even being part of the new government. Next Demirel talked with Yilmaz rival,
Tansu Ciller, leader of a center-right party tainted by the same corruption charges.
Ciller endorsed a broad-based coalition. Bulent Ecevit, leader of a left-center party,
then declared for a coalition with Yilmaz and Ciller. Demirel scheduled a meeting with
Ecevit, suggesting that Ecevit might be the next Prime Minister.
