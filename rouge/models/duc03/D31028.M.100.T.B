Hurricane Georges, with winds up to 135 mph, plowed over and past 17 Caribbean islands
for 11 days in September 1998, causing billions of dollars in destruction and killing
at least 500 people.  The numbers of homeless are staggering, with more than 100,000
people left homeless in the Dominican Republic alone.  U.S. taxpayers are sure to
foot most of the bill in Puerto Rico, where 30,000 homes were destroyed and another
60,000 damaged. The Caribbean tourist industry's position remained good since many
important tourist destinations were spared.  The varied island societies prepared
and reacted to Hurricane Georges in radically different ways.
