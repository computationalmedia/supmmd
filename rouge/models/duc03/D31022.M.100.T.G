A fire in a Swedish dance hall caused the death of 62 teenage Halloween revelers 
and injured over 160, some 17 of them seriously. Although it was speculated that 
the fire was caused by arson, investigators have not yet determined the cause. 
The hall was packed beyond its capacity of 150 with somewhere between 250 and 400 
persons, and an exit stairway was blocked by fire.  Identifying the casualties was 
a wrackingly slow process due to severity of the burns and lack of identification 
cards. The crowd consisted mostly of immigrants or children of immigrant parents 
from at least 19 nationalities.
