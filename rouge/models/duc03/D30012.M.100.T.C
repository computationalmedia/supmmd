The Leonid meteor showers occur every 33 years as the Tempel-Tuttle comet speeds
through the inner solar system shedding swarms of particles as it nears the sun.
The spectacular 1966 display peaked at 150,000 meteors per hour.  As the 1998
showers approached, scientists disagreed about the vulnerability of the 600 odd
commercial and military earth orbit satellites.  Precautions were taken to place
satellites in a protective modes or angles.  The storm was disappointingly light
compared to 1966.  Afterwards, no problems were reported.  The viewing was best
in Asia, poor in the States.  Scientists built unique equipment to conduct their
experiments.
