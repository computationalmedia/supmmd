As the 1998 mid-term elections approached, it seemed that Republicans might gain 
a filibuster-proof 60 seat majority in the senate. Four Democratic incumbents 
seemed to be in real danger while two Republicans seemed to have the edge in 
contests to fill vacancies previously held by Democrats. A strong bid by the 
Democratic challenger to the Republican incumbent in New York did not seem enough 
to avoid strong Republican gains. The Monica Lewinsky scandal and the impeachment 
inquiry in the house also seemed to bode ill for the Democrats and Democratic 
house candidates struggled with the question whether to support or oppose 
impeachment.
