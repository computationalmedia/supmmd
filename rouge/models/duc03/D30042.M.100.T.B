Two Libyans were indicted in 1991 for blowing up a Pan Am jumbo jet over 
Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988. The United Nations imposed sanctions on Libya in 
1992 because of their refusal to surrender the suspects. The sanctions included a 
ban on all international flights.  After six years of sanctions, Libyan leader 
Moammar Gadhafi, faced with threats of additional sanctions, agreed in principle 
to hand over the suspects.  The two suspects would be tried in the Netherlands by 
Scottish judges under Scottish law. Gadhafi wants guarantees, including a promise 
that the suspects would serve their sentences in the Netherlands or Libya if 
convicted.
