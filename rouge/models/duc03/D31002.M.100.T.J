Pope John Paul II, during a visit to Croatia, beatified the WW II cardinal of 
Zagreb, Alojzije Stepinac, for his staunch opposition to communism. Though a 
hero to Catholics, who comprise 80 percent of Croatia, Serbs view Stepinac as a 
wartime sympathizer with the pro-Nazi dictatorship that governed Croatia and 
killed thousands of Serbs, Jews, and Gypsies. Stepinac eventually denounced the 
atrocities, but to Serbs he is a symbol of Vatican cooperation with fascist 
leaders who are now being recast as Croatian patriots. Arrested in 1946 as a 
Nazi sympathizer, he was jailed and then released under house arrest in 1951.
