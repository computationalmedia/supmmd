For four days in September 1998 Hurricane Georges plowed through the Caribbean
affecting more than 30 million people. A high pressure system kept the storm on
its east-to-west course. More than 500 were killed, more than 138,000 left homeless
and property damage exceeded $5 billion. Authorities in Haiti and the Dominican
Republic seemed unprepared as reflected in death rates of 221 and more than 280
respectively. Widespread destruction of homes in Haiti and Puerto Rico presented
major problems of funding because of the number of uninsured homes and the lack
of local financial resources, but U.S. and international assistance was quickly
arranged.
