Five days before money for the new fiscal year was to run out, Democrats accused 
the Republicans of deliberately moving slow on the 13 spending bills needed to 
keep the government from closing down. The situation was complicated by Republicans 
promoting bills with anti-environmental riders subject to veto by the President, 
plus demands for full funding for IMF. The Republicans began to back down, however, 
apparently to focus more on impeachment and to prepare for November elections. They 
compromised on environmental issues, a much smaller tax cut plan, and a conditional 
loan to the IMF to avert international economic crisis.
