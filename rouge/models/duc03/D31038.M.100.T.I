On August 7, 1998 the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania
were bombed.  A total of 259, all but 12 Africans, were killed and more than 5400,
mostly in Nairobi, were injured.  Two vehicles were used in each attack.  The U.S.
has tied these attacks to Osama bin Laden and his radical Islamic terrorist
Al Qaeda organization.  Immediate retaliations included cruise missile attacks
on his camp in Afghanistan and a factory in the Sudan.  By late October, a number
of people had been charged, some arrested, and efforts to extradite others were
continuing.
