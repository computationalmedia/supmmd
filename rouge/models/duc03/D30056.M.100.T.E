Four employees of Grange Telecom, a British telecommunications company, were
found murdered following a failed rescue attempt by Chechen authorities. The
men had been decapitated. The men, Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and
Rudolf Petschi, and New Zealander Stanley Shaw, were abducted during a shootout
in October which also resulted in the wounding of several bodyguards. The men
were in Chechnya working on installing telecommunications equipment for the
Chechen government. Despite warnings from the British government about the
dangers of traveling in Chechnya, the company felt the risk to its workers
was low because the men were working for the Chechen government.
