Starting in May 1998, Philippine Airlines (PAL) laid off 5000 of its 13,000 
workers. A 3-week pilots' strike in June and a currency crisis that reduced 
passenger numbers made payments on PAL's $2 billion debt impossible. President 
Estrada brokered an agreement to suspend collective bargaining for 10 years in 
exchange for 20% of PAL stock and union seats on its board. The large ground crew 
union initially voted no. After PAL shut down operations for 13 days starting 
Sept. 23rd, leaving much of the country without air service and foreign carriers 
flying some domestic routes, 61% voted yes. Unions agreed to some employee cuts 
with separation benefits.
