All 229 people aboard Swissair's New York-to-Geneva flight 111 died when the MD-11
airliner plunged into the sea off the Nova Scotia coast on September 2, 1998. Pilots
reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes before the crash. The specific cause of the
tragedy was never determined, but suspicions are that an electrical short caused a
fire. Following the crash, Swissair voluntarily disconnected its video-on-demand
systems because they were connected to a power supply routed through the cockpit.
The FAA ordered inspection of two cockpit switches in all MD-11's and is considering
whether there should be a life expectancy for some airplane wiring.
