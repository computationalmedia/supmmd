With the arrest of political dissidents, including Xu Wenli, Wei Jingsheng, and 
Qin Yongman, China went on the offensive against individuals seeking to set up 
political parties in that country. In a speech to the Communist Party, Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin denounced any attempts to set up a multi-party system in 
China. The three prominent dissidents all were arrested on charges of subverting 
national security. With government harassment of lawyers, the dissidents have 
been unable to secure legan counsel and have had to defend themselves. The father 
of Qin Yongman has sought a delay in his son's trial until legal counsel can be 
found.
