Losing $30 billion after Russia's collapse triggered a currency and stock market 
collapse in Brazil, following failed economic projects, hyperinflation, large trade 
and budget deficits, and dependence on foreign capital. The IMF, the US, and Brazil 
finalized a $30 billion 3-year IMF package to stabilize Brazil's economy, contingent 
on reforms. Clinton lobbied Congress for $18 billion, fearing Brazil's troubles would 
affect the US. President Cardoso narrowly won re-election and pledged austerity 
measures to reduce the budget deficit. Brazil would raise $20 billion next year 
through spending cuts and taxes, 30% from states and municipalities. The real will 
probably be devalued. Investors will watch for reforms and Brazil's backing from wealthy 
nations.
