The fate of Asia's oldest airline, PAL, is uncertain. Negotiations with Cathay 
Pacific Airways to infuse $100 million dollars into the company collapsed when 
PAL Chairman Tan refused to agree to major job cuts and to relinquish management 
control to Cathay. PAL is buried under a $2.2 billion dollar debt it cannot repay 
and $1 million a day losses. A replacement investor is unlikely and President 
Estrada, though supported by Tan in the election, has rejected a government 
bailout. PAL's financial troubles were exacerbated by a two-week shutdown in 
September due to a dispute with its largest union.
