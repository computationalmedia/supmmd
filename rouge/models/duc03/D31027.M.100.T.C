Iranian pro-democracy demonstrators protested the action of the conservative,
12-member Council of Guardians that rejected 214 of 400 candidates who wished
to run in the national election for the 86-member Assembly of Experts.  This
assembly elects and supervises the country's supreme leader, who has final
say in all things.  In vetting these aspirants, the council eliminated most
reformist supporters of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate clergyman with
wide popular support.  In the heavy boycotted election that followed, hard-liners,
not surprisingly, won 54 of the 86 seats; moderates won 13, and independents 3.
Sixteen seats went to candidates whose affiliation is unclear.
