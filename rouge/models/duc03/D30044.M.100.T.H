Abdullah Ocalan's Kurdish Workers Party fought for autonomy in Turkey since 1984, 
causing 37,000 deaths. Turkey and the US labeled him a terrorist. Turkey threatened 
to attack Syria unless Ocalan was expelled. He fled to Russia and requested  asylum. 
Russia's parliament unanimously asked Yeltsin to grant it, while denying Ocalan's 
presence. Turkey asked Russia to extradite him. Greek and Italian parliaments invited 
him to visit. Kurds in Armenia and Cyprus staged hunger strikes and demonstrated in 
his support. Ocalan flew from Moscow to Rome under a false passport. Italy had to 
arrest him on landing, given the serious charges. Ocalan requested Italian asylum. 
Italy has refused extraditions to capital punishment countries.
