Three months after the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, a U.S court 
indicted Saudi businessman Osama bin Laden for the attacks. Bin Laden is possibly 
in Afghanistan, protected by the Taliban, which has refused a Saudi request to 
expel him. Reportedly, however, the Taliban might try him for the earlier bombing 
of the American barracks in Dhahran. Three suspects jailed in Manhattan for the 
embassy bombings are allegedly associated with bin Laden or the network of 
anti-U.S. militants that support his objectives. Recently, the State Department 
admitted receiving an intelligence report forewarning of the Nairobi embassy 
attack.
