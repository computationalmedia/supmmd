On Friday morning, November 6, 1998, a red Fiat blew up at a market in Jerusalem.  
The two bombers were killed and 21 others injured.  Netanyahu immediately suspended 
discussions on ratifying the Wye Peace Accord, which would turn an additional 13% 
of the West Bank over to Arafat.  The Islamic Jihad was blamed for the blast, which 
exploded prematurely saving many lives.  President Clinton, Secretary of State Albright, 
and Egyptian President Mabarak urged the Israelis to continue the ratification process.  
Arafat condemned the bombing and vowed to find the mastermind, but castigated Netanyahu 
for using the bombing as an excuse to derail the accord.
