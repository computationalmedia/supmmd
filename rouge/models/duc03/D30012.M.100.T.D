The Leonid meteor shower that occurred on 16 and 17 November 1998 consisted of small
fragments from the Comet Temple-Tuttle. Some scientists predicted that the 1998 meteor
shower would be intense. Asia was expected to be the best viewing area. The display
in Asia was disappointing, but was unexpectedly good over southern Europe.

Chances of severe damage to any private or government were considered minimal. Nevertheless,
operators of the 600 plus satellites that relay national defense information, entertainment
and news stories took cautionary steps to further reduce risk.  There were no reports
of damage to any satellite.
