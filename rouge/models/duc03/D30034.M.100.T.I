After several months of relative calm, killing resumed on October 30, 1998 in the
disputed East Timor territory.  Three Indonesian soldiers were killed amid rumors
that the military was increasing its presence in the territory.  Indonesia, which
annexed the territory in 1975, had offered East Timor some autonomy, but would
retain control of defense, foreign, and economic policy.  The East Timorese were
seeking a referendum.  The United Nations was trying to mediate an agreement
between Portugal and Indonesia.  Commemorations of the November 11, 1991 massacre
added to the tensions.  Both sides accused the other of mounting new offensives and
killings, kidnappings, and demonstrations continued.
