Tensions have increased between Turkey and Syria, bringing the two countries to
the brink of war. Syria is displeased with Turkey's growing relationship with
Israel. Additionally, Syria has made territorial claims against Turkey and
accused Turkey of diverting water from rivers that flow through both countries.
Turkey accuses Syria of abetting Kurdish rebel activity in Turkey and granting
a safe haven to Kurdish rebels. Turkey has raided Kurdish camps in Iraq and has
massed troops on the Syrian border. In an effort to diffuse the crisis, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak has flown to Syria and Turkey.
