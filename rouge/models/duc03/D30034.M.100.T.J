The East Timor Human Rights Center accused the Indonesian military of executing 
50 East Timorese, possibly in retaliation for an attack on the troops by rebels 
in which three Indonesian soldiers died. The Indonesian Human Rights Commission 
said it would investigate the incident. Indonesian President Habibie proposed 
granting some autonomy to East Timor, which it invaded in 1975 and later annexed, 
in exchange for its recognition of Indonesian sovereignty. Independence activists 
have rejected the offer and call for a referendum. The U.N. never recognized 
Indonesian rule over East Timor and is mediating talks between Indonesia and 
Portugal, East Timor's former ruler.
