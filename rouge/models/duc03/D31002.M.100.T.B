On Pope John Paul II's three-day visit to Croatia, he beatified controversial 
cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, in Marija Bistrica, Croatia's leading shrine to the 
Virgin Mary. Roman Catholics hail Stepinac as a martyr, but many Serbs and Jews 
accuse him of sympathizing with the Nazis. The Croats, most of whom are Catholic, 
welcomed the pope with joy, as did President Franjo Tudjman. At a mass in Split, 
John Paul called for reconciliation throughout the former Yugoslavia and urged 
the world to do more for the victims of the Balkan war that ended not long ago in 
Croatia and that has most recently raged in Kosovo.
