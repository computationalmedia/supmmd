The level of anti-abortion violence and terrorism seems to be increasing in the
U.S. and Canada.  Since 1993, three doctors, three clinic employees and a clinic
escort have been murdered and there have been more than a dozen attempted murders
of abortion providers.  Arson and bombings of clinics have become commonplace.
The last victim of this violence is Dr. Barnett Slepian, an abortion provider at
a public clinic in Buffalo, N.Y.  Viewed by admirers as brave and conscientious,
he was shot by a sniper.  His death has become an anti-abortion violence issue
in two N.Y. State political office races.
