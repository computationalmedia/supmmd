With a change of government in Indonesia in 1998, supporters of independence for
East Timor called for a referendum to decide the territory's future. Indonesia
offered only a degree of autonomy under Indonesian sovereignty. Indonesia's
claims of troop withdrawals from East Timor were contradicted by leaked official
documents. Violence increased with East Timorese attacking Indonesian soldiers
and mass executions of East Timorese by Indonesian forces. Portugal sided with
East Timor. A U.N. envoy mediating the dispute appeared optimistic about a plan
for broad autonomy for East Timor under Indonesian sovereignty, but as 1998
moved towards a close the issue was not resolved.
