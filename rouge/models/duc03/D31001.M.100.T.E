The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, headed by Bishop Desmond Tutu, has 
issued its report on human rights violations in South Africa during apartheid. 
The report, which covers the years from 1960 to 1994, lays a major portion of the 
blame on the ruling South African government during the period. All political 
parties, especially the African National Congress, also were accused of involvement 
in human rights violations. Former President de Klerk, who began the process to end 
apartheid in South Africa, was successful in having his name suppressed in the 
report. The African National Council also was considering bringing suit to have 
details of its role suppressed.
