Making obvious their intention to suppress the fledging China Democratic Party,
Communist officials arrested three of its most prominent leaders, Xu Wenli, Qin
Yongmin and Wang Youcai.  Colleagues protested and the USA expressed concern,
to no avail.  China, defending its action, brought all three to trial.  Because
potential defense lawyers were harassed, all three had to defend themselves.
Qin and Wang were charged with inciting subversion, which carries a minimum
sentence of five years imprisonment.  Xu faces the more serious charge of
subverting state power which can bring a life sentence.  Chinese President
Jiang said multiparty democracy will not be allowed.
