Typhoon Babs slammed into the Philippines in mid-October killing at least 150 
people, injuring hundreds, and forcing hundreds of thousands to abandon homes 
damaged or destroyed by winds, floods, and landslides. Worst hit was a 
coconut-producing area whose damage toll subsequently caused a significant 
localized rise in cooking oil prices and contributed to inflationary pressures. 
Fund-raising campaigns began with a one-year salary donation by the Philippine's 
president. The powerful storm also brought torrential rains and landslides to Taiwan 
where floods forced hundreds from their homes. Hong Kong was lashed with strong winds, 
forcing authorities to open shelters and close beaches.
