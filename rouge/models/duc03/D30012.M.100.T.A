Optimum viewing of the Leonid meteor shower in November 1998 was forecast for East Asia.
Some predicted the shower to rival the greatest of the century in 1966, others said it
would be more modest. Meteor showers are hard to predict. Of particular concern in 1998
was the danger posed by the storms to earth-orbiting satellites. Some satellites were
repositioned to be less likely targets, but authorities differed as to the real danger.
Scientists studied the showers with various airborne instruments. In fact, the showers
were more impressive viewed from Europe than East Asia and there was no damage to satellites.
