British authorities arrested General Augusto Pinochet, in London for back 
surgery, on an international warrant issued by Spanish magistrate Baltasar 
Garzon. The Madrid court charged Pinochet, who ruled Chile as a despot for 17 
years, with crimes against humanity, including genocide and terrorism, involving 
the deaths of more than 4,000 people. The Chilean government protested that 
Pinochet, now a "senator-for-life," has legal immunity, but few in Chilean 
society protested the arrest. Pinochet's arrest shows the growing significance 
of international human-rights law, suggesting that officials accused of atrocities 
have fewer places to hide these days, even if they are carrying diplomatic passports.
