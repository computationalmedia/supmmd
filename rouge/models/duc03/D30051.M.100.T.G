The U.N. war crimes tribunal created to investigate evidence of atrocities issued 
its third conviction when a Bosnian Serb confessed to 14 murders. At the trial of 
four guards accused of atrocities against Serbs at a Bosnian prison, the tribunal 
considered a lesser sentence against one guard because of evidence of mental disorder. 
A potential witness for the tribunal survived a massacre in Kosovo that killed 13 
ethnic Albanians. Belgrade has refused to allow the tribunal to probe alleged 
atrocities in Kosovo. The U.S. unanimously disagrees with Yugoslavia's contention 
that Kosovo is off limits and insists on compliance with investigations.
