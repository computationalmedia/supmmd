Brazilian President Cardoso won his first-round re-election because voters trusted 
his economic management more than that of his chief rival. However, Brazil has 
serious financial problems due to money depreciation and large trade and budget 
deficits, particularly after becoming caught up in the financial turmoil that 
began in Southeast Asia with foreign investment pullouts. The IMF and the U.S. 
could provide an aid package pending evidence of a promising economic recovery plan 
that would cut government expenses. Gubernatorial elections will be important 
because governors control a considerable share of the national budget and could be 
told to cut local budgets.
