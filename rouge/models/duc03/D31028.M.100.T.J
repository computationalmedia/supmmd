Hurricane Georges, packing winds up to 110 mph, swept through the northern 
Caribbean killing over 400 people, leaving at least 140,000 homeless, and 
causing billions in property damage. In Puerto Rico alone, though the residents 
were forewarned of the hurricane's approach, nearly 30,000 houses were destroyed. 
The cost of rebuilding the homes will be largely borne by the residents and U.S. 
taxpayers, since most homeowners are uninsured. Haiti, the poorest nation in the 
Western hemisphere was a disaster zone. There, mudslides and floods killed a total 
of 221 people, 102 in Fonds Verettes. Georges, however, spared many other Caribbean 
tourist destinations.
