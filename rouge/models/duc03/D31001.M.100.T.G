A South African panel probing the apartheid-era abuses is releasing its final 
report following a 2-year investigation. The panel,  the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission (ARC), found that most violations of human rights were through government 
security and law enforcement agencies. However, the panel has also accused the African 
National Congress (ANC) of human rights violations. The last apartheid president, F. W. 
de Klerk, will not be implicated in the rights violations after threatening a court 
challenge. The goal of the ARC is to create an idealistic reconciliation of all citizens 
through amnesty rather than hold politically divisive trials.
