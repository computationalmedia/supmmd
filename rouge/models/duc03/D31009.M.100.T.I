On December 2, 1998, Turkish President Demirel was expected to ask former Deputy 
Premier Ecevit to create a new government with a secular coalition of his Democratic
Left party and two center-right parties.  The last government fell on November 25,
following a no confidence vote and rumors that Prime Minister Yilmza had mafia ties.  
Demirel did not call on the Islamic Virtue party, even though it held the most seats 
in Parliament, the traditional qualification to form a new government.  He turned 
instead to Turkey's strong military and pro-western secular leadership.  Virtue 
conceded the role, calling any government interim since the next election will be 
in April.
