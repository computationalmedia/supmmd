Election of members to serve in the Assembly of Experts occurred on 23 October 1998.
The 86-member cleric-based Assembly is important because it names and supervises
the country's supreme leader. The conservatives' decisive victory was inevitable
because the conservative-dominated 12-member Council of Guardians that passed
judgment on the list of candidates rejected all except 30 of the moderate candidates.

Moderate supporters of President Khatami publicly protested the action of the
conservative screening council. Moderates threatened to boycott the election,
and voter turnout was unusually low. Conservative hard-liners won at least 54
places on the 86-seat Assembly.
