With many Democrat seats in jeopardy, Republicans expect modest to high gains 
in both the House and Senate 1998 races.  Several independent analysts also 
believe that Republicans will gain many of the tightly contested seats.  In 
Illinois Republican Peter Fitzgerald holds a strong lead over the incumbent 
Democrat Senator Carol Mosely-Braun.  Perhaps less typical is New York State, 
where Democratic challenger Schumer has battled to a statistical tie with 
incumbent Republican Senator D'Amato.  As campaign tactics, both skewed their 
political ideology toward the center, with each accusing the other of extremism.  
The effect of President Clinton's impeachment hearings on these elections is 
unknown.
