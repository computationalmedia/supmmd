In October 1998 Turkish-Syrian dissension reached the level of undeclared was.
Turkey massed troops on the Syrian border, and Turkish jets buzzed the border.
Turkey has long accused Syria of aiding Syrian-based Kurdish rebels who make
cross-border raids on Turkey. Syria denies this and accuses Turkey of illegally
diverting water from flowing into Syria. Israel and Turkey signed military
accords in 1995, and Syria says that the two are conspiring against Syria.
Israel denies this. Turkey and Syria have also quarreled over a territorial issue.

Egyptian President Mubarak worked to ease tensions. He led discussions in Ankara
and Damascus.
