Congressional work on the budget was marked along party lines as Democrats sought 
to include more funding for social and environmental issues while the Republicans 
sought to push tax cut issues as well as seeking changes to the IMF. When Congress 
failed to adopt a budget by the end of the fiscal year, it voted a continuing 
spending resolution to keep the government operating. As talks bogged down, the 
threat of another government shutdown began to loom. Republicans, wanting to keep 
public focus on the Clinton impeachment proceedings, backed away from some of the 
more unpopular riders on the bills, especially some anti-environment issues.
