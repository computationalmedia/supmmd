The Justice department invoked the Sherman Antitrust Act, and brought civil suit
against Microsoft, the world's largest software producer.  Twenty states also
charged Microsoft. The trial began 23 October 1998.

The government charged that Microsoft sought Netscape Corporation's collusion in
restricting competition in the Internet software market. When Netscape refused,
Microsoft attempted to thwart competition by bundling its browser with the highly
popular Windows operating system. Microsoft denied all charges. The case is important.
Microsoft's loss could lead to increased watchdog scrutiny in the high-tech world.
Microsoft's attempt to acquire 3Com's Palm Pilot indicated that their aggressive
business practices would continue.
