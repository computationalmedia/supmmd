Swiss Air flight 111 crashed off Nova Scotia on Sept. 2, 1998 killing all 129 passengers
and crew. The cause has not been determined, but there was extreme heat damage to the
front of the aircraft and it is suspected that an in-flight entertainment system had
electrical problems. Swiss Air, while insisting that the system was installed correctly,
has disconnected the system in other aircraft as a precaution. The airline immediately
offered $20,000 to families of the victims and, having opted out of a $75,000 liability
cap, began work on a plan to provide compensation of approximately $137,000 per family.
