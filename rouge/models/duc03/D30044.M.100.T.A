In October 1998, under pressure from Turkey, Syria expelled Abdullah Ocalan, 
leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), identified as a terrorist 
organization.. Ocalan was rumored to be in Russia. Turkey asked Russia to 
extradite Ocalan, but Russia would not even confirm his presence there. In 
mid-November Ocalan suddenly arrived in Rome on a flight from Moscow and was 
immediately arrested. Turkey called for Ocalan=s extradition from Italy. Although 
as a NATO ally Italy might grant Turkey's request, it had consistently refused to 
extradite anyone facing the death penalty as Ocalan clearly would in Turkey, so 
the outcome remained in doubt.
