The worst fire in Swedish history occurred on October 29, 1998, when a Goteborg 
dancehall, jammed with teenaged immigrants, burst into flame.  By November 2, 
the death toll stood at 62, with 162 injured, 17 of whom were still in intensive 
care.  Officials had not yet determined the cause.  Four hundred people had been 
crowded into a hall approved for only 150.  Fire blocked one exit and the other 
exit contained furniture.  Rescuers took 6 minutes to arrive, after having trouble 
understanding the accented call for help, but the fire spread very rapidly.  
The dead included individuals with 19 different nationalities.
