At 4am October 3, 1998, gunmen abducted Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, 
Rudolf Petschi, and New Zealander Stanley Shaw from their house in Chechnya. 
They worked for British firm Granger Telecom installing a telecommunications 
system.  Britain had advised citizens to avoid Chechnya but the Chechen 
government guaranteed Granger worker safety. Employees went voluntarily. No 
ransom demand was received. Chechnya's mountains were thoroughly searched. 
A captured kidnapper revealed the hostages' locations. A rescue attempt was 
mounted but failed. Two months after abduction the hostages' bodies and severed 
heads were found. The deaths damaged international recognition of Chechnya's 
independence. Many factions were suspected of the kidnappings but no sure blame 
assigned.
