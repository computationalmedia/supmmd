Many issues and sometimes conflicting strategies for stabilizing the global 
economy surfaced at the October IMF and World Bank meeting. Japan announced a 
multi-billion dollar program for Asian nations. Russia threatened to default on 
loans unless it received the billions that were suspended by the fund. The U.S. 
sought to change the role of IMF from disaster relief to before crisis assistance. 
Brazilian officials negotiated for an IMF bailout of at least $30 billion. Though 
IMF managing director Camdessus supported the aid package, the Brazilian government, 
led by recently reelected President Cardoso, must take serious steps to reduce 
the budget deficit.
