Invoking the Sherman Act, the Justice Department and 20 states have begun 
anti-trust proceedings against Microsoft Corporation. Key to the government's 
case is the allegation, supported by Netscape, that Microsoft suggested in a 
June 1995 meeting that Netscape join Microsoft in dividing the internet software 
market. In a taped deposition, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates denied any knowledge 
of such an offer. Microsoft lawyers later produced an e-mail from Netscape President 
James Barkdale which suggests Netscape was a willing participant in the internet 
software discussion. Despite the on-going suit, Microsoft made an unsuccessful bid to 
acquire the software business behind the Palm Pilot.
