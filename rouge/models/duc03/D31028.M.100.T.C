For eleven days in September, Hurricane Georges 110-135 mph winds plowed across the
Caribbean, killing at least 500 people and inflicting more than $5 billion in property
damage before expiring over Georgia.  The numbers of homeless is staggering.  Hard-hit
Antigua, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and St. Kitts will be hurt further
by the continuing loss of tourism.  Fortunately, many tourist areas escaped unscathed:
the Windward Island group, Trinidad and Tobago, the Dutch Islands, the Bahamas,
Cayman Islands, Jamaica and the Turks and Caicos.  U.S. aid will be needed for
rebuilding, particularly in underinsured Puerto Rico and destitute Haiti.
