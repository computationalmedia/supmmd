Cooking oil prices rose sharply in the Philippines on speculation that copra 
production will decline due to the effects of el Nino and recent typhoons on 
coconut crops. Typhoon Babs, which caused 151 fatalities and forced 400,000 
people from their homes, was particularly destructive in the Bicol region, a 
large coconut-production area. After Babs, President Estrada declared four provinces 
and a city to be calamity zones, eligible for emergency funds. He also jump-started 
a fund for victims of the typhoons with a contribution equivalent to his yearly 
salary. Babs subsequently swept through Taiwan, triggering landslides, and Hong 
Kong.
