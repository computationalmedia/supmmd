Philippines Airlines (PAL), Asia's oldest airline, devastated in 1998 by pilot
and ground worker strikes and with a rising $2.1 billion debt, stopped all
operations for 13 days.  A 10-year, no-strike agreement was finally ratified
when the government began using foreign carriers for domestic flights.
PAL resumed domestic flights on October 7 and international flights slowly
over the next weeks.  This shutdown had been another blow to the debt ridden
national flag carrier.  Following the strike, efforts to revive the airlines
met more obstacles.  Cathay Pacific Airways would only help if the payroll,
including 200 pilots hired during the pilot strike, were slashed.
