Swissair flight 111 crashed off Newfoundland on September 2, 1998 after leaving 
New York for Switzerland. The pilots reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes 
before the crash.  All 229 people aboard died. Swissair is compensating and 
further assisting the grieving families. Eventually, over 90 percent of the 
plane, a 7-year-old MD-11 which last had major maintenance 13 months earlier, 
was recovered. Wreckage showed evidence of high heat and heat damaged wiring 
above the cockpit area but investigators remain unsure of its cause.  The 
planes' in-flight entertainment system is suspect. A final determination of the 
crashes cause is still far off.
