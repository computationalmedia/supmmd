At fiscal year's end on Sept. 30, 1998, Congress had not approved 13 necessary 
spending bills, so voted emergency funding to keep the government running through 
Oct. 9th, then Oct. 12th. Members were eager to campaign at home for re-election 
but also to ensure funding for pet projects. Some bills risked veto because of 
anti-environmental riders. Several bills combined into an omnibus bill would make 
veto difficult. Republicans, vowing  to avoid another shutdown that would distract 
attention from impeachment, became willing to resolve spending issues and dropped 
huge tax cut demands. Final unresolved issues included  funding for the IMF and 
emergencies, and census technique. Clinton consulted other governments on proposed 
IMF changes.
