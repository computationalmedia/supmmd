Palestine, in a step toward statehood, opened and began operating its own airport 
in Gaza under accords brokered by President Bill Clinton.  Israel retains control 
over Gaza airspace and security over arriving passengers and cargo.  Jubilation 
erupted among Palestinian airport officials and passengers as the first 
Palestinian flight left Gaza~Rs Yasser Arafat International Airport bound for 
Amman, Jordan.  The fledging Palestinian airline has two 50-seat Fokker 50s, and 
a Boeing 727.  They are flown by PLO pilots trained by other Arab countries and 
airlines.  Israeli officials soon threatened to close the airport and delayed 
departure of some flights over security concerns.
