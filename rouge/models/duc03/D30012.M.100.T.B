The Earth encounters Leonid meteors every year on about the same date, but 
only once in approximately every 33 years do heavy bombardments occur.  The 
meteors are mostly microscopic fragments of Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. This year, 
Asians were treated to the most spectacular view. Meteor sightings peaked at 
slightly more than 2,000 per hour - barely one-tenth the rate at which meteors 
hit the atmosphere during the great 1966 Leonid storm. Many of the world's 600-plus 
satellites were maneuvered to reduce the possibility of damage from the speeding grit. 
No problems were reported.  Scientists conducted many experiments to further knowledge 
about meteor storms.
