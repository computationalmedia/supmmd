Thailand is hosting the Asian Games and, with Tajikistan, Mongolia, and a
Palestinian team expected to confirm, expects athletes from 39 countries,
regions or organizations. Afghanistan, claiming financial problems, will
not attend while North Korea, despite widespread hunger at home, will attend.
Despite the loss of some veteran athletes and past drug problems, China hopes
to do well in the medal standings even as it sends its first taekwondo team
to the competition. Kazakhstan has hopes of taking the gold in women's diving
while India hopes to regain the top position it once held in world field hockey.
