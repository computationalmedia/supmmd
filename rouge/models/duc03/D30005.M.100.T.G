A U.S. federal court returned a 238-count indictment against Saudi exile Osama 
bin Laden for conspiring to bomb two U.S. embassies in Africa and committing other 
acts of terrorism. Evidence was compiled mainly from determination of links to bin 
Laden by suspects indicted in connection with the Embassy attacks as well as other 
previous terrorist activities. At the urging of the U.S., Saudi Arabian officials 
attempted to persuade the Taliban's leader to deport in Laden from Afghanistan, 
but he refused. Pakistani Muslim militants threaten retaliation if their "hero" is 
arrested. The U.S. is offering a $5 million reward for information leading to his 
arrest.
