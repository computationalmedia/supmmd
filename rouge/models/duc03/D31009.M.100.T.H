The Turkish government of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz fell after mob-tie
allegations. Turkey's constitution mandates a secular republic despite its
Muslim majority. Military and secular leaders pressured President Demirel
to keep the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party on the fringe. Business leaders
feared Virtue would alienate the EU. Virtue's leader ceded its right as
Parliament's largest party to lead the government. Bulent Ecevit, leader
of the Democratic Left Party and former PM, asked Yilmaz and True Path
Party head Tansu Ciller to join him in a secular coalition, creating a
large Parliamentary majority. A political vacuum risked Islamic ascension
and endangered a Kurdish rebel's extradition.  Demirel was expected to name
Ecevit PM.
