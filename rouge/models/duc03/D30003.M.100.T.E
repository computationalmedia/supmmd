Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London on charges
of human rights violations. Pinochet, in London for back surgery, was arrested
in a Spanish warrant accusing him of genocide and terrorism. It is alleged that
Pinochet was responsible for the disappearance or death of over 3,000 people
while he was dictator of Chile between 1973 and 1900. Chile protested the arrest
stating that Pinochet's status as senator-for-life gave him diplomatic immunity.
Britain's Labor government was obviously embarrassed by the diplomatic
implications of the arrest. The arrest shows the growing significance of
international human rights law.
