Swissair announced that it was disconnecting the Interactive Flight Technologies 
entertainment system installed on its remaining MD-11s and Boeing 747s after 
investigators of the crash of Swissair Flight 111 found that the wires of the 
state-of-the- art system were heavily heat damaged. The flight, bound for Geneva 
from New York, crashed off the coast of Nova Scotia, killing all 229 people onboard. 
Swissair is among the carriers that has opted out of a $75,000 liability cap for 
people killed or injured during international flights and is looking into making 
payments of up to $137,000 to the families of the victims.
