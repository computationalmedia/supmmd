The IMF and the US Treasury Department are preparing a loan package of $30 billion 
or more to stabilize Brazil's economy as Latin American economic officials decry 
paltry IMF programs to their countries. Brazil is suffering from a failing economy 
carrying both a large trade and a budget deficit. The re-election of Brazil's 
President by a narrow margin dims hopes for economic reforms. He will have to 
initiate rapid and unpopular steps to save his country's economy. Influencing the 
IMF bailout decision is the slow progress Brazil has shown on reforms that would cut 
government expenses over the long term.
