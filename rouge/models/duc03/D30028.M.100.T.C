Tensions between Turkey and Syria reached a stage of "all but declared war."
Turkey accuses Syria of harboring militant Kurdish rebels.  Damascus denies sheltering
Kurdish fighters.  Turkey attacks Kurds in northern Iraq and masses troops on its
Syrian border.  Syria accuses Turkey of forming military and diplomatic alliances
with Israel designed to subvert Syria and Arab states.  Further, Syria accuses
Turkey of diverting water from rivers that flow through both countries.  Israel
stresses that it has no part in the Turkey-Syria dispute.  Egypt's President Mubarak
with Saudi and Arab support visits both countries to mediate the dispute and defuse
tensions.
