Syria acceded to Turkish demands that it stop supporting the rebellious PKK and 
expel the group's leader, Abdullah Ocalan, averting a military crisis. Turkey calls 
the PKK, which seeks an autonomous Kurdish state in Turkey, a terrorist organization 
and Ocalan the country's most wanted criminal. Nearly 37,000 people have died in the 
conflict. Ocalan, the subject of a Turkish international arrest warrant, was detained 
in Rome after arriving there from Moscow where he had sought asylum. It is uncertain 
whether Italy will agree to Turkey's extradition request. Meanwhile, hunger strikes 
to protest Ocalan's detainment have occurred in Nicosia and Armenia.
