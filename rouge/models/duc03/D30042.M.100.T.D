In December 1988 a Pan Am jet was blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270.
Two Libyan suspects were indicted in 1991. Since 1992 Libya has been under U.N.
sanctions in effect until the suspects are turned over to United States or Britain.
Sanctions include an air embargo. African leaders disregard them. Libya has fostered
tourism to help the damaged economy.

In August 1998 United States and Britain proposed a Netherlands trial. Libya agreed,
but then asked for guarantees that the suspects, if convicted, would be incarcerated
in Libya. This delayed progress. Kofi Annan planned a December 1988 Libyan trip to
move negotiations.
