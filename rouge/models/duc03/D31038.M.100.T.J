A tapestry of associations link Osama bin Laden to the U.S. embassy bombings in 
Tanzania and Kenya and other terrorist acts. Salih Idris owned a Sudanese 
pharmaceutical plant with a suspected chemical weapons role and allegedly had 
ties with a bin Laden backed group. Fazul, accused of directing the Nairobi 
attack, reportedly led the Kenyan cell of bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda. 
While in Kenya, Fazul roomed with el Hage who was arrested in New York and 
charged with being a member of bin Laden's network. The Taliban has refused 
U.S. and Saudi Arabian requests to deport bin Laden from Afghanistan.
