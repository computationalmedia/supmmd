Unknown Chechen gunmen abducted three Britons and one New Zealander, all 
employees of a British telephone company in the capitol city of Grozny in 
Chechnya. The British Foreign Office said it had warned the company to 
withdraw from Chechnya. More than 100 people are being held captive in 
Chechnya and anti-kidnapping officials have become victims of apparent 
hostage takers. Some two months after the kidnapping, Chechen officials 
reported finding the severed heads of the four kidnapped men near a small 
village west of Grozny. The Chechen president said the bodies of the four 
men were recovered but there was no further comment.
