Friday morning shoppers fled the Mahane Yehuda marketplace when a smoking car
approached the entrance. It exploded, killing the bombers and injuring 24, before
explosives-filled suitcases could be carried into the crowd. Hamas claimed
responsibility but Iranian-sponsored Islamic Jihad was later suspected. Israel's
Cabinet immediately suspended deliberations on the US-brokered Wye Accord, under
which Israel would relinquish 13 percent more of the West Bank and Arafat would
crack down on terrorists. Many doubted Netanyahu would let the accord be
implemented, thus playing into militants' hands. Arafat and Clinton urged that
the attack not derail the accord.  This third failure of an attempted attack
suggested the crackdown on terrorists had produced results.
