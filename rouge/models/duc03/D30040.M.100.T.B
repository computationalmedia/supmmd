The opening of the Gaza International Airport was stipulated by the U.S.-brokered 
Wye River accord. Palestinians marked the event with euphoria. The airport will 
ease the claustrophobia of Gazans and provide a boost to the troubled Palestinian 
economy.  Many Palestinians consider the airport a big step toward independence. 
Although security remains in Israeli hands, Palestinians will no longer have to 
travel to Jordan or Israel to travel abroad. Flights are sometimes delayed when 
the Palestinians and Israelis disagree on security procedures. Since Wye, Israel 
and Palestine have accused one another of reneging on agreements, and Israel has 
frozen the accords.
