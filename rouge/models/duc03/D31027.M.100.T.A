In Iran prior to the 1998 election of the 86-member Assembly of Experts, the
Council of Guardians, dominated by political hard-liners, rejected 214 of 400
prospective candidates, disqualifying many supporters of the popular moderate
reformist President Mohammed Khatami who criticized the selection process.
Many moderates pledged to boycott the election. On election day official
media reported an "unprecedented and unique" turnout, but few voters were
seen at the polls. The conservatives won a decisive victory as expected
with less than half of the eligible voters going to the polls. Hard-liners
won at least 54 of the 86-seats and the moderates only 13.
