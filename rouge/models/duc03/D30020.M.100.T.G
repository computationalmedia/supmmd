Thailand expects about 10,000 athletes to compete in its Asian Games in 1998. 
China has 596 athletes at the games and hopes to win 100+ medals. It has also made 
sure its swimmers will avoid their drug scandals of previous Asian Games. The 
Chinese women divers expect to win gold over the highly competitive Kazakhstan 
competitors. North Korea, absent from the last games, has sent 307 athletes and 
officials. India hopes to defeat favorite South Korea in field hockey and regain 
its dominance in that sport. China, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, and Thailand 
have won second-round soccer berths at the games.
