Dr. Barnett Slepian, a prominent Buffalo, New York obstetrician who provided 
abortions at a Buffalo clinic, was slain by a sniper's bullet Friday night. The 
sniper, who fired through a kitchen window, shot Slepian as he talked with his 
wife and one of his sons. The attack on Dr. Slepian is the fifth by anti-abortion 
terrorists on doctors in the U.S. and Canada since 1994. All of the attacks occurred 
around November 11th, Veterans Day in the U.S. and Remembrance Day in Canada,  but 
marked as "Remember the Unborn Children Day" by anti-abortionists. The search of the 
sniper is continuing.
