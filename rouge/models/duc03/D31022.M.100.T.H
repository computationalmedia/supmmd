Sweden's deadliest fire in decades, in an overcrowded discotheque with one available
exit, killed 62 and injured 162. Some jumped from windows. Most victims died from
smoke inhalation. Almost all were immigrant teenagers representing 19 nationalities.
The fire's cause remains undetermined. Its speed and a report of teens ejected
earlier suggest arson. Evidence also points to a short-circuit. Firemen, accused
of slow response, arrived 6 minutes after deciphering a call in poor Swedish.
Identifying victims was slow because many were too young for drivers licenses.
A memorial was held at Goteborg Cathedral. The hall, rated for 150 but packed
with 400, was  rented to Kurdish students who organized the party.
