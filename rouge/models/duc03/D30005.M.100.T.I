Osama bin Laden, living in Afghanistan, was indicted in New York on November 3, 
1998 on 238 counts, including conspiracy to bomb the U.S. embassies in Tanzania 
and Kenya, committing acts of terrorism against Americans abroad, and leading a 
vast terror conspiracy.  Two of the accused bombers were directly linked to bin 
Laden; Al Owahali asked him for a "mission" in 1996 and el Hage was his aide in 
both the U.S. and Africa.  A refuge center in Brooklyn was also directly linked 
to bin Laden and his violence.  Islamic militants declared him a hero and 
threatened revenge.  Saudi Arabia attempted to placate the U.S. and Afghanistan.
