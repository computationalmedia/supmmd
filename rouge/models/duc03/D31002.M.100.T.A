In October 1998 Pope John Paul II visited Croatia where, at Marija Bystrica, he
beatified Cardinal Stepinac, archbishop of Zagreb during World War II. Revered by
Croats as an anti-communist martyr, Stepinac is regarded by most Serbs as a Nazi
sympathizer. Thus the Pope, while preaching peace, unity, and reconciliation,
stirred up enmities in the former Yugoslavia. After the beatification the Pope
moved on to Split where he called for a more democratic Croatia "based on the
moral values inscribed in the very nature of the human being," and asked the
world to do more for victims of the recent Balkan war.
