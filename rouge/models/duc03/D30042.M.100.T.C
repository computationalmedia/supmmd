Two Libyans, accused by the United States and Britain of bombing a New York bound 
Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, killing 270 people, for 10 years 
were harbored by Libya who claimed the suspects could not get a fair trail in 
America or Britain.  The U.N. imposed international air travel sanctions on Libya 
to force their extradition.  The sanctions were honored by all but certain African 
countries.  In 1998, a U.S.-Britain brokered compromise offered that their trial 
to be held in the Netherlands.  Gadhafi, tired of sanctions and hoping for increased 
tourism, actively pursued this compromise with UN Chief Kofi Annan.
