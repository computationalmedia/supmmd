In October 1988 China signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights. Perhaps emboldened by that, dissidents pushed for the recognition of a
new China Democratic Party. The government, citing a long-standing policy,
said that it would not tolerate another political party.

Three prominent dissidents, one of them Wu Xenli, working to establish the new
party were arrested. They were accused of endangering national security, and
faced prison terms of five years. Prospective defense lawyers were intimidated.
The United States criticized the arrests, and an embassy official was rebuffed
when he tried to observe a trial.
