Dr. Barnett Slepian was murdered in his suburban Buffalo home on 23 October 1998.
He maintained a private obstetrics practice, and worked regularly at Buffalo's
only public abortion clinic. Snipers had attacked five abortion providers in
New York and Canada over the past four years. Slepian had been warned that he
was endangered.

Abortion rights advocates decried Slepian's murder, and blamed opponents, including
some politicians, of creating a climate that led to the killing. Slepian's murder
was a factor in the New York Attorney General and senatorial campaigns. Investigators
reported little progress. The FBI was aiding local police.
