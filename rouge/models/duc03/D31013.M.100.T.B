Dr. Barnett Slepian, an obstetrician who performed abortions at Buffalo Women's
Gynecological Services clinic, was killed by a sniper's bullet as he stood in the
kitchen of his home.  His slaying is the most deadly example of what law-enforcement
officials describe as an annual pattern of anti-abortion violence in Canada and
western New York.  Slepian's killer is still at large. Slepian had endured years
of picketing and harassment, and had received a warning earlier on the day he was
slain about possible attacks against abortion providers.  Slepian's death has
become a factor in several political campaigns in New York.
