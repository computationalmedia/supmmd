A car bomb exploded in a Jerusalem market Friday killing two assailants and wounding 
21 Israelis. The militant group Hamas claimed responsibility. The incident caused the 
Israelis to suspend ratification of a U.S.-brokered Wye River accord calling for 
Israel to give Palestine 13% of the West Bank in exchange for a Palestinian campaign 
against Islamic militants. Arafat promised to hunt the masterminds of the bombing and 
urged the Israelis not to halt the accord. Some believe the failure of the attack 
indicates Arab-Israeli efforts are weakening the militants. The president of Egypt is 
skeptical that the Israelis will implement the accord.
