Fernando Cardoso was re-elected as Brazil's President on 4 October 1998. He
received slightly more than the majority needed to insure a first round victory.
Leftist da Silva received 34%. There was some illegal late campaigning. Half of
the country voted on shoe-sized computers that confused some older voters.

Brazil is in dire economic straits, and Cardoso promised an austere program to
ensure financial credibility. By slashing spending and raising taxes Cardoso
hoped the country would qualify for an IMF loan. Many Cardoso allies were trailing
in state level run-off races. Their defeats will hurt Cardoso. Pessimism pervaded
the presidential inauguration.
