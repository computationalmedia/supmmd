Turkish President Demirel will meet Deputy Premier Ecevit, fueling speculation 
that Ecevit will lead the government following Prime Minister Yilmazi's ouster 
over corruption charges. Ecevit proposed a new secular coalition combining his 
party with those headed by Yilmaz and former premier Ciller. Reportedly, Ecevit 
is supported by Turkey's powerful, pro-Western military. Traditionally, the 
Islamic Virtue Party would establish the new government since it holds the most 
seats in Parliament, but the constitution mandates a strictly secular republic. 
Furthermore, the military would not support an Islamic government. The government 
crisis comes during negotiations with Italy to extradite PKK rebel leader, Ocalan.
