Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was re-elected in the first round of
the election with 56 percent of the vote, eliminating the need for a runoff.
Cardoso easily defeated three-time presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva,
who garnered only about 34 percent of the vote. The election, held as Brazil was in
the midst of an economic crisis, ensured that continuity of leadership would be
maintained. Newly re-elected President Cardoso delayed announcing plans for
economic reform until after the gubernatorial elections. Those elections, which
saw many rivals elected, cast doubt on the future of Cardoso's economic reforms.
