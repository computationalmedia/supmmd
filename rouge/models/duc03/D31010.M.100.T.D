A killer cold wave hit much of Europe in November 1998, lasting more than four weeks
in some areas.  Romania and Poland suffered most.  France, Bulgaria, Italy, Croatia
and Russia also experienced bitter cold. Temperatures reached as low as minus 26
degrees Celsius.

In Romania cold and blizzard conditions closed major roadways, and dozens of trains
were canceled. Communities were without electricity. The death toll was staggering.
At least 39 died in Moscow. The death toll in Poland reached 85 in the four weeks
after 16 November. Some died in storm-related accidents. Most victims were homeless,
or those suffering from alcoholism.
