The international war crimes tribunal in The Hague considered including Kosovo 
in its investigation of Yugoslavia. Milosevic denounced the tribunal, saying no 
crimes occurred. Investigators left without visiting Kosovo or interviewing a lone 
massacre survivor. Milosevic agreed to comply but reneged. The UN ruled investigators 
had authority throughout Yugoslavia, called a "rogue state" for refusing Kosovo access. 
Sanctions were threatened. Three judges and a new trial chamber were added and crimes 
on both sides investigated. Bosnian Muslim guards at Celebici prison camp were charged 
with murdering, torturing, raping and beating Serbian prisoners. A Bosnian Serb pleaded 
guilty to 14 murders, the tribunal's third conviction.  Pre-verdict sentencing arguments 
speeded tribunal work.
