Supertyphoon Babs, on the heels of Supertyphoon Zeb, brought heavy winds and rain
to the Philippines, first hitting Catanduanes Island Thursday and stalling there 12 hours.
Landslides and drownings killed at least 156.  400,000 were driven from their homes. The
two typhoons destroyed $100 million in crops, including abaca and coconut. President
Estrada ordered riverside slums evacuated, facilitated emergency fund use and price
freezing, and started a typhoon-victim fund.

Heading toward southern China, Babs strengthened to sustained winds of 81 mph and gusts
up to 100 mph. It brought torrential rains, flooding, and landslides to Taiwan and
strong winds to Hong Kong before weakening to a severe tropical storm Sunday night.
