The House voted to open a formal impeachment inquiry into the Clinton/Lewinsky 
affair Thursday, but the outcome of the process is unpredictable and is somewhat 
dependent on the results of the November elections. Several Democratic incumbents 
in the Senate, among them Barbara Boxer and Carol Mosely-Braun, and at least one 
Senate Republican, Alfonso D'Amato, are in tight races. If the Republicans take 
control of the Senate by a large margin, some will view it as a mandate to move 
toward impeachment. Alternatively, modest Republican gains in Congress could be 
a signal that the citizenry has rejected impeachment.
