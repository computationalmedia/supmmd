Indonesia invaded East Timor in December 1975, a few months after the departure of
Portugal's colonial administration.  It annexed the territory, 1,200 miles east of
Jakarta, one month later.  The United Nations still considers Portugal the
administering power and is sponsoring peace talks between Indonesia and Portugal.
Portugal and East Timorese pro-independence groups insist that a referendum be held
to decide East Timor's future.  Pro-independence activists and Indonesian soldiers
have clashed for years.  In 1991, Indonesian troops massacred at least 50 pro-
independence protesters.  Portugal is trying to extradite former President Suharto
for alleged human rights abuses committed under his authoritarian rule.
