After a delay of almost two years because of security questions, the Palestinians
opened their first international airport in a rare example of cooperation between
Israel and Palestine. Israel will continue to share security responsibilities at
the airport with the Palestinians. An Egypt Air plane was the first to touch down
at the newly opened Gaza International Airport.  The highlight, however, was the
landing of the first Palestinian Airlines plane.  Security concerns continue to
plague the running of the airport as Israeli security officials first threatened
to close down the airport and later delayed the departure of two planes because
of security disputes.
