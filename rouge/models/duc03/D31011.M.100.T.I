Typhoon Babs hit the Philippine Islands on October 21, 1998, with 150 mph winds 
causing flooding, landsides, and flying debris.  Hundreds of thousands had to flee 
their homes, 156 were killed, and $100 million worth of crops were damaged.  
Parts of the northern and central areas were declared a "state of calamity", and, 
on October 29, a fund-raising campaign to aid the victims was begun.  After leaving 
the Philippines, Babs moved over the South China Sea, hitting Taiwan on the 25th 
with heavy rains and winds and pushing strong winds into Hong Kong.  Later in the 
day, Babs weakened to a severe tropical storm.
