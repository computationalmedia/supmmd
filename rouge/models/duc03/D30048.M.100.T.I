By October 1998 Brazil~Rs economy had ground to a halt.  The rampant inflation had
been stopped, but deficit spending continued, as did a huge trade deficit.  Following
the Russian default on foreign loans in August, foreign capital flew out of Brazil
even though interest rates skyrocketed, almost overnight, to 40%.  Prior to the
November election the president began seeking monumental help from the International
Monetary Fund and enlisting support from the United States and other Group of Seven
and western hemisphere leaders.  After his narrow election, he hoped to institute
austere measures, drastically cutting spending and improving tax collection efforts.
