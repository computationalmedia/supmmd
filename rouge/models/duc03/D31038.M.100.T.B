A total of 248 people, including a dozen Americans, were killed in the terrorist
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi on August 7, 1998.  A twin attack on the
U.S. Embassy in Tanzania killed 11 people, all Africans.  Osama bin Laden is the
suspected mastermind of the bombings.  Through the Saudis, the United States asked
the Taliban, the Islamic movement that controls most of Afghanistan, to deport
bin Laden, but they refused.  Evidence suggests that the terror suspects accused
in the bombings, regardless of their nationality or place of residence, are associates
of bin Laden or associated with terrorist groups under his control.
