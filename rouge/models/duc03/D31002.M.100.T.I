Pope John Paul II paid a three-day visit to Croatia in November 1998.  The 
primary purpose of this, his second, visit was the beatification (the last step 
before sainthood) of Cardinal Stepinac, who died in 1960.  The Pope declared 
Stepinac a martyr to the atrocities of Communism, but many non-Catholics considered 
him a nazi sympathizer during World War II.  Almost 500,000 people attended the 
ceremony in Marija Bistrica.  The Pope later met with President Tudjman in Zagreb 
and said a final mass in Split, where he called for reconciliation, a renewal of 
values, and increased international aid to the war-torn Balkans.
