The Gaza International Airport opened on 24 November 1998 after a delay of two years.
The airport was stipulated by the Clinton-brokered Wye River Accords. Jordan, Morocco,
Spain and the Netherlands helped finance its construction. Palestinians were elated,
considering the airport as a potential economic lifeline, and a step toward statehood.
Israel still controls the air space and oversees security. Early operations were
disrupted by Israeli-Palestinian security disputes.

The first Palestinian commercial flight occurred on 5 December 1998. The Palestinian
Airlines is tiny, but regular flights to Jeddah, Cairo and Amman are planned, and
eventually pilgrimage flight to Mecca.
