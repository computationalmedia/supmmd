Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), was detained on
November 12, 1998, in Rome as he got off of a flight from Moscow.  Turkey, where
he is on trial in absentia, is seeking his extradition.  Germany also has issued
an arrest warrant.  The PKK has been fighting Turkey for autonomy since 1984.  After
heavy Turkish pressure, Syria had expelled Ocalan on October 21.  Although his
location was not known for several weeks, he sought political asylum in Russia.
He is now expected to ask for asylum in Italy.  Ocalan's odyssey has spawned
demonstrations in Armenia and Cyprus.
