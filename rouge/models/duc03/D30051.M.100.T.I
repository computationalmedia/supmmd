The United Nations Security Council established a War Crimes Tribunal in 1993 to
investigate and prosecute crimes arising from the breakup of Yugoslavia.  In
October 1998, the tribunal secured its third conviction when a Bosnian Serb plead
guilty to 13 murders.  Also that month, the trial of four for 1992 atrocities in
a Bosnian prison camp was nearing completion.  Also, Kosovo became an area of
contention.  The Yugoslavian government was claiming the tribunal had no
jurisdiction over the 9-month rebellion and was refusing investigators visas.
The U.N. tribunal sought to enter the province and investigate atrocities
reported by both sides.
