Results of the 1998 U.S. Mid-Term Congressional elections will be far-reaching.  
Republicans have a long shot at gaining a filibuster-proof 60-seat majority in 
the Senate. Noted battles for Senator include D'Amato vs. Schumer in New York, 
and Moseley-Braun vs. Fitzgerald in Illinois.  Republicans are often characterized 
as "conservatives" while Democrats are characterized as "liberals."  Political 
hybrids resist easy characterization as exemplified in D'Amato vs. Schumer.  As 
Election Day nears, the House Judiciary Committee is considering impeaching 
President Clinton for alleged perjury and obstruction of justice in connection 
with the Lewinsky affair.  The outcome of the elections is likely to influence 
deliberations about impeaching Clinton.
