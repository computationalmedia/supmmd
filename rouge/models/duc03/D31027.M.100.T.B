Iran's conservatives won a decisive victory in elections for the 86-member
clergy-based Assembly of Experts that oversees the country's supreme leader.
The results were expected since the 12-member Council of Guardians, dominated
by hard-liners, had dropped most moderates from the ballot in advance of the
election.  Iran's official media boasted about a huge voter turnout, but
correspondents, citizens, and others disputed these claims.  Many Iranians
said they stayed away to protest stacking the deck.  The hard-liners won at
least 54 places on the 86-seat Assembly and the moderates only 13.  Most of
the other winners lean toward the hard-line camp.
