In 1998  two Libyans indicted in 1991 for the Lockerbie bombing were still in 
Libya. In 1992 the U. N. voted sanctions against Libya for its refusal to turn 
over the suspects. Suffering from the sanctions, Gadhafi alternated between 
defiance and acceptance. In August of 1998 the U.N. proposed a trial in the 
Netherlands under Scottish law which Libya accepted in principle, but insisted 
that any sentence be served in the Netherlands or Libya. The U.N. threatened a 
tightening of sanctions. Then, in late November, the U. N. Secretary General 
hinted that he might broker an agreement. Optimism arose, but the issue was 
still in doubt.
