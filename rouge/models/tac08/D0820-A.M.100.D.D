For nearly three days, a Russian mini-submarine was trapped about 600 feet below the surface of the Beryozovaya Bay.
The AS-28 became snarled in the cables of an undersea coastal monitoring system.
Throughout the ordeal, there were varying estimates of the remaining oxygen supply.
When Russian attempts to tow the sub to shallower water failed, they sent out an urgent call for international help.
Japan, Britain and the US all dispatched vessels to aid the rescue efforts.
A British Super Scorpio robotic underwater vehicle succeeded in freeing the mini-sub.
All seven sailors aboard were rescued in satisfactory condition.
