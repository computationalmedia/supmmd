The Lefkow murder investigation continues.
FBI Director Mueller testified to lawmakers that the case will be solved.
Bart Ross confessed to the Lefkow murders in his suicide note.
Several years ago Judge Lefkow had dismissed Ross' billion dollar medical malpractice suit.
DNA evidence gathered at the murder scene matched Ross' DNA.
Gun shells found at the suicide location along with the note recounting details only the killer would know point to Ross as the likely killer.
No evidence has been found linking Ross to the Hale supremacist group.
Authorities will not close the case before ballistic results are completed.
