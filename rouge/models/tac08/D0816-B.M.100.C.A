Talks with North Korea reconvened following a five-week break.
The U.S. and North Korea remain at a stalemate on the nuclear weapons program.
A joint statement was signed with North Korea agreeing to rejoin the Treaty, to permit international inspectors, and to discontinue their nuclear weapons program.
No timetable was determined.
The international community promised to provide aid, security, energy assistance and work towards improving relations.
The day after signing the statement North Korea reversed their decision to cease the weapons program until they receive a light-water reactor to create electricity.
