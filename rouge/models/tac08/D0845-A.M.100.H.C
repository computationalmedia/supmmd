The ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), thought extinct since 1944, was seen again February 11, 2004 near where it was last seen in the "Big Woods" region of eastern Arkansas.
Several independent sightings and video by teams from the Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology and the Nature Conservancy, ruled out the similar pileated woodpecker and confirmed the rediscovery, which was kept secret for over a year to prepare to protect the bird's habitat not least from a flood of bird watchers, for which private groups, including The Nature Conservancy spent about $10 million, and the Interior Department committed over $10 million.
