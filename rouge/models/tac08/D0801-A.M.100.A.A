The European Airbus A380 flew its maiden test flight from France 10 years after design development started.
The A380 super-jumbo passenger jet surpasses the Boeing 747 and breaks their monopoly.
Airlines worldwide have placed orders but airports may need modification to accommodate the weight and width of the A380.
U.S. airlines have not placed an order.
Airbus has fallen behind in production and a backlog of orders has developed.
Airbus must sell at least 250 planes to break even financially.
The A380 is overweight and modifications to meet the weight requirements impacted the budget.
Additional test flights are planned.
