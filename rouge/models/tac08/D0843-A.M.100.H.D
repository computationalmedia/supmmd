J.K. Rowling's sixth novel in the Harry Potter series will go on sale on July 16 in Britain, the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and China.
The announcement delighted readers, booksellers, and owners of Bloomsbury Publishing stock, whose shares surged 7%.
Within 24 hours, the book shot to Number 1 on Amazon's bestseller list.
British police arrested two men for the theft of two copies of the book six weeks before its launch.
A Canadian bookstore accidentally sold up to 15 copies about a week early, and a court injunction barred anyone from leaking the plot.
