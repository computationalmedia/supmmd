U.S. District Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow's mother and husband were shot at her home in an apparent retaliation for her contempt order against Matthew Hale, a previous defendant in a civil copyright lawsuit with white supremacist elements.
Hale is currently in federal prison awaiting sentencing for previously soliciting the murder of Lefkow.
Federal agents and police are investigating Hale's colleagues and looking for two men seen near Lefkow's home at the time of the murders.
Evidence recovered at the scene include: shell casings, a fingerprint, footprint, and cigarette butts.
Hale denies any involvement in the murders.
