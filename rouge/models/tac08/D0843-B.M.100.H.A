A Canadian store that sold copies of the book before the launch begged for their return.
An unprecedented court injunction was issued to prevent those purchasers from reading, copying, selling, or talking about the book prior to the launch.
In the first 24 hours available, the book sold 6.9 copies in the US.
The second printing is being delivered to US bookstores.
A Braille edition will be available within 3 days of the initial launch so the sight impaired will not have to wait.
The Potter books have been translated into 63 languages with more than 300 million copies sold.
