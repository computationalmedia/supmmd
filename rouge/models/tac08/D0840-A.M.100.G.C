Electric power networks are vulnerable to physical attacks (conventional explosives or nuclear electromagnetic pulse) and computer attacks (external or internal) against the internet-based supervisory control and data acquisition computers and networks that remotely control power generation and transmission.
Recognized cyber-security improvements need to be implemented more comprehensively, especially against documented threats from Al-Qaida, and older, less secure equipment replaced.
Network stability and capacity, and ensured power locally, can be improved with on-site power generation that can also increase power available to the network, such as from fuels, solar, wind, and fuel cells.
Excess power can be stored as hydrogen.
