Charles Taylor disappeared 48 hours after the Nigerian government rescinded his political asylum.
Bowing to international pressure the Liberian government was preparing to take Taylor into custody to extradite him to Sierra Leone.
United Nations chief Kofi Annan requested West African countries to deny Taylor refuge and arrest him.
Taylor was arrested the next day by Nigerian police while attempting to cross the border into Cameroon.
Upon his involuntary return to Liberia he was flown by the United Nations peacekeeping force to Sierra Leone and was read the arrest warrant.
Taylor will appear before the Special Court on April 3.
