Three pipeline projects underway to transport natural gas from Asia to Europe are raising political and unspecified environmental concerns.
A northern pipeline delivers gas to Germany, France and England.
A central one connects Turkey to Romania, Bulgaria and Austria.
The southern one supplies Greece and Italy from Turkey.
The pipeline to Germany circumvents the concept of a common European policy with Russia.
Russia has a monopoly agreement on gas exported from Kazakhstan produced in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
Russia's actions are viewed as applying political pressure on neighboring countries.
The pipelines are expected to begin operating between 2007 and 2010.
