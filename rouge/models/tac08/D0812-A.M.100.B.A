After Mikhail Saakashvili replaced Eduard Shevardnadze as the Georgian President he vowed to reunite the separatist pro-Russian regions of Georgia and fight against corruption.
Adzharia was reunited but not Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
Conflicts in these regions include officials screening ship passengers, the threatening of boats in Georgian waters, and the suppression of press critical of Saakashvili.
He has the support of the United States in efforts to bring democracy to Georgia without war.
Meetings are being held with region leaders mediated by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
Saakashvili seeks an agreement between Georgia and Russia to be signed by Putin.
