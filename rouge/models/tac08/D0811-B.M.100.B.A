After 18 months the International Astronomical Union has still not determined the criteria for planethood.
Pluto's eventual status will also define new space objects.
However the data from the Pluto space probe in 2015 will come too late to settle this argument.
Recent discovery of two additional moons around Pluto complicate the issue.
The diameter of Pluto and UB313 is about 1,380 and 1,800 miles respectively and both have methane ice on their surfaces.
Proposed definitions based on size or gravitational pull either include or exclude Pluto and UB313.
The scientific deadlock at the Union will not be resolved quickly.
