They have requested federal, state and local assistance.
Soldiers are being re-deployed for animal rescue.
More than 4,000 animals have been rescued with some being sheltered in other states.
Animals are micro-chipped and photographed to assist in reunification.
Monetary and animal supplies donations are continuing.
