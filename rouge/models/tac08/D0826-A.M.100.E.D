Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his associate Michael Scanlon are at the center of a growing corruption scandal.
The investigation began with allegations of fraud in dealings with a number of American Indian tribes, but widened to include golf junkets and dealings in the Northern Marianas.
The scandal has focused attention on a number of members of Congress and their associates, including House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas and Rep. Robert Ney of Ohio.
Abramoff has been arrested on fraud charges stemming from a Florida deal.
Scanlon is expected to plead guilty to charges and cooperate with government investigators.
