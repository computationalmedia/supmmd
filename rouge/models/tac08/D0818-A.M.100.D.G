Once white supremacist Matthew Hale was convicted and in jail for plotting to kill Judge Joan Lefkow, her security detail was dropped.
Killers entered her house, had her husband and mother lie on the basement floor, and shot each to death.
Police and FBI investigated widely but focused on Hale and his violent supporters.
Evidence included a window shard with a fingerprint, a bloody mop and shoeprint, cigarette butts, and 22-caliber shell casings.
Witness sightings of two white men waiting in a red Ford Escort produced composite sketches.
Investigators seized communication and computer records and offered a $50,000 reward.
