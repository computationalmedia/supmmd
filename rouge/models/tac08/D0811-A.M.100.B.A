Debate continues on whether Pluto discovered in 1930 is a planet or a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO).
Up to 100,000 bodies may be in the Kuiper Belt.
There is no standard definition of planet and no limit to potential new planets.
Pluto's small size, odd orbit and orbital plane is closer to a KBO than a planet.
The recently discovered 2003 UB313 beyond Pluto is larger and similar in composition.
UB313 is very bright with a skewed orbit and a moon.
UB313's mass will be determined from its moon.
The International Astronomical Union will decide if UB313 is a planet.
