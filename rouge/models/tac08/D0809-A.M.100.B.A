W. Mark Felt, former Deputy Director of the FBI during the Nixon Administration has ended speculation and admitted to being the mysterious Deep Throat.
Felt made his revelation via his lawyer in a Vanity Fair article.
The Washington Post was completely blindsided after keeping Felt's secret for 30 years.
Reactions to Felt's admission varied from being declared a hero to being called a criminal.
Many felt relief at no longer being suspects.
Former Nixon aides decried Felt as disloyal and unethical.
Bob Woodward is publishing his book on Deep Throat now instead of upon Felt's death as previously planned.
