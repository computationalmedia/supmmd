In July 2005 ornithologists Richard Prum, Mark Robbins and Jerome Jackson, submitted a paper questioning the sufficiency of the evidence for the ivory-billed woodpecker's rediscovery.
They withdrew their paper after hearing audio recordings of calls and raps reportedly matching 1930's recordings of the bird.
But they and others remained skeptical.
In December over 100 researchers and volunteers began an intensive six-month search across 500,000 acres of Arkansas wetlands seeking definitive evidence of the bird.
A local town benefited from bird watching tourists.
In January 2006 Jackson published an article saying claims for proof of the bird's existence constitute "faith-based ornithology".
