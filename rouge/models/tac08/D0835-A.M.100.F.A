Steroid use appears rampant in Major League Baseball based on former player revelations and the BALCO steroid distribution scandal.
Steroids were banned by the League in 2004 but it did not include designer or precursor steroids.
The new Anabolic Steroid Control Act makes steroid precursors controlled substances.
Congressional hearings on steroid use are being held.
Former and current team members and League officials are being called to testify, some by subpoena.
The League's testing program is weak compared to World Anti-Doping Agency standards.
Lawmakers are considering stronger action if the League does not impose mandatory bans to police the League.
