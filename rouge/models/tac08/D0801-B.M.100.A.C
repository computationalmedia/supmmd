By June 1, 2005 customizing A380s for 15 different client requirements, notably for different passenger entertainment systems, had delayed deliveries up to 8 months, risking millions in penalties.
The first A380 delivery (to Singapore) slid from early to late 2006.
With 159 orders from 16 customers and 100 options, production fell behind demand, raising the price to U.S. $292 million.
Possible A380 air turbulence problems potentially requiring ICAO rule-making, a wing load test failure and passenger injuries during a simulated evacuation did not slow deliveries.
By 2006 20 airports will be A380-ready; 38 by 2008; 60 by 2010.
