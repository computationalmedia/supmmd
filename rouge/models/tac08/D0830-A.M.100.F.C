After two false arrests, suspected Wichita, Kansas "BTK serial killer", Dennis Rader, was arrested February 25, 2005.
He was held for 10 first-degree murders, from 1974 to 1991, but won't get Kansas's death penalty instituted in 1994.
Local and county police, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, and the FBI worked 31 years on 5,000 tips and evidence provided by BTK: eight letters to police and media, a victim's necklace BTK gave to his girl friend, a victim's driver's license, BTK's recorded voice and crime scene semen, thousands of DNA swabs, BTK's DNA linking to Rader, and facts matching Rader's biography.
