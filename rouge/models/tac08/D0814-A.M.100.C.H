The latest Darfur peace talks opened on 24 October in Abuja, Nigeria.
Sponsored by the African Union, the meetings between Khartoum and the Darfur rebels were expected to last at least three weeks.
The meetings were adjourned on Wednesday morning so that AU mediators could prepare a document for discussion that same afternoon.
An earlier AU summit in Abuja concerning the Darfur crisis collapsed on 18 September when the two sides disagreed on security issues.
Foreign ministers from Libya, Sudan, Egypt, Nigeria, and Chad had met in Libya on 16 October to prepare for that summit.
