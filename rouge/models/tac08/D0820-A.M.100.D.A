A Russian mini-submarine containing 7 submariners became trapped for 3 days on the sea floor in eastern Russia.
The submarine was entangled in fishing nets and/or a coastal monitoring system antenna.
Russian rescue attempts to free and raise the submarine were unsuccessful.
Russia requested international help.
Japan, Britain and the U.S. responded with rescue equipment.
The British Navy used a robotic vehicle to free the submarine which then surfaced.
The crew were in satisfactory condition and taken for medical examination.
Russia's naval equipment has not been upgraded as promised by Putin following the Kursk submarine tragedy.
