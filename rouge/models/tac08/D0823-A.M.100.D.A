The Ukrainian presidential election race to replace President Kuchma is close and competitive.
Viktor Yushchenko, former Prime Minister and leader of the anti-Kuchma opposition has a small lead over Viktor Yanukovich, current Prime Minister and Kuchma supporter.
Yushchenko became dangerously ill during the campaign claiming an assassination attempt.
No evidence of poisoning has been found by Ukrainian or U.S. investigations.
Yushchenko won the first vote but Yanukovich was declared President after a disputed runoff vote.
Yushchenko demanded the results be annulled.
Yanukovich offered Yushchenko the prime ministry but Yushchenko refused and called for both candidates to withdraw from the race.
