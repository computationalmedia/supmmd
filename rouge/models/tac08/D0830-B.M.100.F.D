Evidence identifying Dennis Rader as the BTK killer was found on a computer disk he mailed to a television station on February 16.
Experts linked the disk to a computer at Christ Lutheran Church, where he served as the church council's president.
Rader broke his 25-year silence after the Wichita Eagle published an article marking the 30th anniversary of the first BTK killings.
Prosecutors cannot yet present their evidence against Rader because he waived his right to a preliminary hearing.
Nearby law enforcement agencies are reinvestigating cold cases that bear similarities to the BTK slayings.
