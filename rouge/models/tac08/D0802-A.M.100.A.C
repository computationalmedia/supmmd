Collapse of coastal Antarctic ice shelves accelerated eight-fold the seaward flow of inland glaciers, raising sea levels: Larsen A (1995), Wilkins (1998), Larsen B (2002), Larsen C (this century).
Currents undermine the Ross and Ronne ice shelves, enabling ice flows from deep within the West Antarctic ice sheet.
Arctic permafrost thawed; glaciers and sea ice retreated.
In 30 years the Arctic ice cap's area shrank by 10%, its thickness by 42%, opening shorter maritime routes when Arctic sea ice disappears in future summers.
Siberian lakes disappeared.
Indigenous cultures and glacier tourism suffered.
Bird migrations shifted.
Northern Hemisphere weather will worsen.
