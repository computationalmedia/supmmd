In a Swiss newspaper interview, Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk said Turkey deliberately killed one million Armenians during WWI, triggering public outrage.
He was indicted under Turkey's revised penal code for "public denigration of the Turkish identity," carrying up to 3 years in jail.
Turkey says the deaths were fewer and from civil unrest, not genocide.
The US, European Union, and activist organizations criticized Turkey's criminal charges for freedom of expression.
The EU said Pamuk's trial would affect Turkey's EU bid.
A Turkish court ruled Pamuk should be tried under old laws requiring justice ministry direct order and postponed the trial.
