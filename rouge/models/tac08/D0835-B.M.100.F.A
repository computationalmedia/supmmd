Congressional hearings and an undercover probe investigating illegal steroid use in Major League Baseball and other sports continues.
Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig admitted the League's policy is not strong enough and has proposed much stricter penalties.
They include a 50-game suspension for the first offense and a lifetime ban for the third one.
These penalties would apply to minor-league players next year.
Selig also requested amphetamines be added to the banned substances.
Congress has threatened to implement a testing system unless the League strengthened its policy.
The Players Association has not responded to the proposed penalties.
