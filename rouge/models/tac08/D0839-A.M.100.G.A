In August 2003, former Liberian President, Charles Taylor, accepted asylum in Nigeria from 17 counts of war crimes in Sierra Leone.
He has been accused of violating the asylum agreement by harboring Al-Qaeda terrorists, interfering with Liberian presidential elections and an assassination attempt on the Guinea President.
The U.N.-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone is pressuring the Nigerian to send Taylor home to Liberia.
U.N. peacekeepers would transfer him to Sierra Leone for prosecution.
Reversing an earlier statement, Liberia's new President states that Taylor should go directly to Sierra Leone from Nigeria since he has not been indicted in Liberia.
