Four coordinated terrorist attacks occurred in London during the morning rush hour on Thursday 7 July.
Bombs exploded on three subway trains and one double-decker bus.
The bombs all contained similar components: military-grade explosives under 10 pounds, small enough to fit into a backpack.
The explosions killed at least 52 people and injured more than 700.
Investigations at the tunnel site were slow, hampered by very high heat, asbestos dust, and twisted metal.
Investigators do not know how many suspects they are looking for, but reported progress toward identifying one of the bombers.
