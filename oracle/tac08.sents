Averting a showdown, centrists from both parties reached agreement on a compromise that clears the way for confirmation votes on many of President George W. Bush's stalled judicial nominees, leaves others in limbo and preserves Senate filibuster rules.
"In a Senate that is increasingly polarized, the bipartisan center held," Democratic Sen Joseph Lieberman said Monday night.
The two page memorandum of agreement said it is "based upon mutual trust and confidence."
Under the terms, Democrats would agree to oppose any attempt to filibuster and thus block final votes on the confirmation of Priscilla Owen, Janice Rogers Brown and William Pryor.
There is "no commitment to vote for or against" the filibuster against two other conservative nominees, Henry Saad and William Myers.
Despite behind the scenes efforts at compromise, partisan lines deepened in the Senate's historic debate over judicial nominees Thursday as a Republican who had advocated finding a middle ground lined up behind the GOP's leadership and both parties injected racial politics into the fight.
Another sign of the hardening of positions came late in the afternoon Thursday when Sen Rick Santorum, R Pa., chairman of the Republican Conference, the No. 3 job in the leadership, invoked Adolph Hitler in his criticism of Democrats.
Santorum said Democrats broke Senate rules with their filibusters of judicial nominees two years ago.
Their criticism now of Republican efforts to change the rules on debating judicial nominees is "the equivalent of Adolph Hitler in 1942 saying, 'I'm in Paris.
How dare you invade me.
How dare you bomb my city?
It's mine."'
There was no immediate response from the Democratic leadership, but the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) posted a video of Santorum's remarks on the Internet shortly after he left the Senate floor.
Sen Gordon Smith, R Ore., once a self described "qualified supporter" of Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist's efforts to force a vote on the judges, announced in the second day of heated debate that his is now an "unqualified" backer of Frist.
Still, a handful of moderates in both parties continued their talks to find a compromise short of the so called "nuclear option" under consideration by Frist a parliamentary maneuver that would make it easier to confirm federal judges but also profoundly alter the way the Senate conducts its affairs.
Those talks took place in the privacy of Senate offices in contrast to the public debate on the Senate floor that seemed to become more heated by the hour, each side accusing the other of political motives well beyond the sole judicial nominee under consideration, Priscilla Owen of Texas.
But both parties used another pending nomination, that of Janice Rogers Brown of California, an African American native of Alabama, to reach out to blacks in the fight over Senate procedures in addressing judicial nominations.
Sen Johnny Isakson, R Ga., recalled the infamous filibusters of Southern segregationists in the 1960s who tried to block passage of major civil rights legislation.
"I would hope that today the filibuster would not be used to deny an up or down vote on Janice Rogers Brown, because every parent deserves to dream for every child that they'll have a chance ,," he said.
Isakson's comments on the Senate floor coincided with Frist's appearance at a news conference outside the Capitol with a group of black ministers, including Bishop Wellington Boone of The Father's House in Atlanta, in support of Brown's nomination to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Although Frist did not mention Brown's race, the Senate majority leader said the Democratic treatment of her nomination was "uncivil" and he vowed that he will "do everything in my power to see that it stops."
At a separate news conference in the Hart Senate office building, Rev. Timothy McDonald, chairman of the African American Ministers in Action (AAMIA), disputed suggestions that racism and sexism are behind opposition to Brown and Owen.
"Believe me, we know well that there are too few African Americans and too few women on the courts," said McDonald, pastor of the First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta.
"We would like nothing more than to remedy this problem.
But appointing judges who will use their powerful positions to issue rulings that hurt women and racial minorities will not solve the problem."
Frist's appearance at the news conference followed his refusal to meet with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, a group of House Democrats who told Frist in a letter that a ban on judicial filibusters "would be particularly offensive to people of color."
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D Nev., showing support for the Congressional Black Caucus, noted that "our nation's judges and courts have often been the last resort for minorities seeking redress from inadequate or unfair laws" but that could change if the Democrats can't block "radical" judges.
Frist said the dispute was really about Senatorial responsibility.
While Democrats are entitled to oppose Owen's nomination to a seat on the New Orleans based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Frist said, "they should not hide behind a procedure that prevents 100 United States senators from their responsibility, their duty to vote 'yes' or 'no' on the nominee."
The Tennessee Republican was referring to the Democrats' use of unlimited debate, or the filibuster, to stall a confirmation vote on 10 of Bush's appellate court nominees in the last Congress.
While only a simple majority of 51 is required to confirm a judge, Senate rules require 60 votes to cut off debate and 67 votes to change the rules.
But Frist is considering a procedure whereby the Senate's presiding officer, Vice President Dick Cheney, will rule that it is unconstitutional to filibuster a federal appeals court nomination, a ruling that could be upheld by at least 51 votes, ending debate and clearing the way for an up or down vote on the nominee.
The issue of how judicial nominations will be addressed in the Senate has taken on a new intensity with the prospect of several Supreme Court nominations in the final three and a half years of Bush's presidency, enough to solidify a conservative majority on the nine member court for a generation.
Smith was the first of several Republican senators to cite Bush's victory in the 2004 presidential election as part of their reason for backing Frist's attempt to remove the filibuster from the Democrats' parliamentary arsenal before there are any battles over Supreme Court nominees.
"Elections have consequences," Smith said.
"The president has rights (to appoint judges of his choice) ,and we have a job to do."
But the Democrat Bush defeated in the 2004 election, Sen John Kerry of Massachusetts, cautioned that the attempt by the Republican majority to change the Senate's rules in such an unusual way represents "a dangerous time for our democracy."
Story can end here.
Optional add follows.
Urging moderate Republicans to join the Democrats in opposing Frist, Kerry said, "The Senate and the country need senators who are prepared to make their mark on history by standing with past profiles in courage, and defending not party, not partisanship, but defending principle and democracy itself."
The second day of debate opened in the Senate with Sen Dick Durbin, D Ill., the assistant Democratic leader, proposing that the Senate set aside Owen's nomination temporarily to allow a vote on four other judicial nominees awaiting a confirmation vote.
When the Republicans objected, Durbin said their actions made it "clear that this is not about judges" but rather "a power grab" by the president and his Republican allies in the Senate.
And when the Democrats, for the second day, invoked a rule to limit the work of committees while the Senate is in session, Sen Mitch McConnell, R Ky., the assistant GOP leader, charged that the minority with "unprecedented obstructionism."
Frist announced Thursday evening that the debate would resume Friday and that he would seek a vote to cut off the debate on Owen's nomination next Tuesday.

Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R Tenn., demanded an up or down vote on one of President Bush's more controversial judicial nominees Wednesday, sparking an historic Senate floor debate that could be the most consequential of Bush's presidency.
Frist brought Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen's nomination to the Senate floor, setting the Senate on a course toward a showdown vote as early as next week on changing its rules and traditions to make it easier to confirm judicial nominees.
Frist set the heated tone of daylong debate when he accused Democrats of using obstructionist tactics "to kill, to defeat, to assassinate" a handful of Bush nominees to federal appellate courts.
And he made it clear he is prepared to take extraordinary parliamentary steps to stop the Democrats.
Those steps, commonly referred to as the "nuclear option" in the Senate dispute, would result in the Senate's rules being changed so that a simple majority vote of 51 senators would be enough to prevent filibusters of judicial nominees.
Currently, it takes 60 votes to stop a filibuster, a form of extended debate that dates back to the 1850s.
"All we want is a vote an up or down vote,' Frist said.
"Judicial nominees with the support of a majority of senators deserve up or down votes on this floor ,Confirm the nominee, reject the nominee, but in the end, vote."
But Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D Nev., charged that the threatened attempt to change the Senate's rules is part of "a power grab" by the Republican majority of the Senate, in league with the Bush White House and the GOP controlled House of Representatives.
"Right now, the only check on President Bush is the Democrats' ability to voice their concern in the Senate," Reid said.
"If Republicans roll back our rights in this chamber, there will be no check on their power.
The radical right wing will be free to pursue any agenda they want.
And not just on judges.
Their power will be unchecked on Supreme Court nominees, the president's nominees in general and legislation like Social Security privatization."
When Frist declined his proposal to adjourn the Senate debate to the privacy of the old Senate chambers in the Capitol a two story antiquated amphitheater abandoned by the Senate in 1859 Reid fired what may have been a political warning shot: he denied what is normally routine unanimous consent to let committees meet more than two hours after the Senate begins its session.
Reid had previously warned that if the Republican majority push the "nuclear" parliamentary button, Democrats would stall all but the most essential legislation in the Senate.
At stake is not just the nomination of Owen and several other Bush nominees to federal appellate courts but the president's ability to steer the entire federal judiciary in a more conservative direction with lifetime appointments to the nation's highest courts, including the Supreme Court where Chief Justice William Rehnquist is ailing with thyroid cancer.
As the debate raged on the Senate floor, moderate senators continued to search for a compromise that would avoid a showdown over the filibuster rule and the half dozen Bush judicial nominees that Democrats have blocked.
Four Democrats and eight Republicans met privately in the office of Sen John Warner, R Va., seeking a deal of some kind, but the meeting concluded only with an agreement to reconvene Thursday.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter, R Pa., who blamed both parties for bringing the Senate to the brink of a political meltdown, decried such attempts at deal making.
"Such a deal on confirmations would only confirm public cynicism about what goes on in Washington behind closed doors," Specter said.
Democrats argued that the conservative views and judicial activism of Owen and California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown, whose nomination is next up on the Senate calendar, are beyond the mainstream of legal thinking in the United States.
Bush has nominated Owen to the New Orleans based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and Brown to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, widely viewed as second only to the Supreme Court in its impact on the American legal system.
The Democrats recalled some of the criticism U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales leveled at Owen when they were colleagues on the Texas Supreme Court.
Gonzales once called Owen's judicial activism "unconscionable."
"Mainstream?
I think not," Reid said.
"Shockingly unjust or unscrupulous that's what Priscilla Owen is in the mind of the attorney general of the United States."
Gonzales, in a brief meeting with reporters last week, down played his past criticism of Owen and said he wholeheartedly endorsed her federal court nomination.
Republicans countered the criticism of the two women by noting that both had won overwhelming majorities in their elections to the state courts on which they sit 84 percent for Owen, 76 percent for Brown.
Sen Kay Bailey Hutchison, R Texas, sought to shift the debate from Owen's judicial record to personal qualities, saying, "I have heard my colleagues and some interest groups use very extreme language to describe Priscilla Owen.
These statements are coming in many cases from many people who have not met her."
But Sen Patty Murray, D Wash., who met with Owen during the nominee's courtesy visits with senators Tuesday, replied that "I couldn't agree more she was a lovely person, but this is not a debate about a lovely person this is a debate about a record ,and whether that record merits appointing someone to a lifetime appointment."
Owen, a member of the Texas Supreme Court since 1994, has a high rating from the American Bar Association.
Her advocates praise her rulings as no nonsense while opponents characterize them as hostile to families and women.
Bush first nominated Owen in 2001, but Democrats have blocked four attempts by the Republican majority to bring her nomination to a confirmation vote.
Likewise, Brown, who was first nominated by Bush in 2003, has been blocked by the Democrats on four separate occasions.

The Senate opened a long awaited debate on whether to ban filibusters of judicial nominees Wednesday with vividly partisan attacks, as a small group of moderates worked behind the scenes for a compromise to avert the showdown.
Senators from both parties filled the chamber all day with impassioned speeches about their constitutional duty to give the president "advice and consent" on judicial nominees.
Majority Leader Bill Frist, R Tenn., set the tone with an opening speech that said Democrats want to "kill, to defeat, to assassinate these nominees."
Democrats denounced his remarks.
Even more intense action took place in small groups and closed meetings, as a half dozen GOP centrists, and an equal number of Democrats, tried to close a deal that would defuse the controversy.
Aides familiar with the negotiations said they focused on two issues: the fate of seven pending appellate court nominees who were blocked from an up or down vote in Bush's first term, and the more difficult issue of agreeing on how Democrats would treat the right to filibuster judicial nominees in coming months, when a Supreme Court vacancy might occur.
The "six and six" proposal, as it is called, would obligate Democratic signatories to forswear backing a filibuster against future judicial nominees except in extraordinary circumstances.
In return, the six GOP signers would agree to vote against efforts to ban judicial filibusters, the aides said.
Such an arrangement would effectively end the crisis because Democrats would not have the votes they need to prevent votes on the nominees in question.
At the same time, Frist would not have the 51 votes he needs to disallow filibusters of judicial nominations.
It was unclear how the proposed accord would handle the seven pending Bush nominees.
Under one scenario, all would receive confirmation votes and presumably be seated on various appeals courts except Henry Saad of Michigan and William Myers of Idaho.
Sources said Saad had made too many Democratic enemies, in part by accidentally sending a senator an e mail that criticized the lawmaker.
Myers, aides said, was a lower priority to Republican conservatives determined to secure confirmations for Priscilla Owen of Texas, Janice Rogers Brown of California and William Pryor Jr. of Alabama.
Senators participating in the negotiations included Democrats Joseph Lieberman, Conn., Ben Nelson, Neb., Mark Pryor, Ark., Robert Byrd, W.Va., Mary Landrieu, La., and Kenneth Salazar, Colo. Republican negotiators included Olympia Snowe, Maine, John McCain, Ariz., Mike DeWine, Ohio, John Warner, Va., Lindsey Graham, S.C., and Lisa Murkowski, Alaska.
Warner hosted at least one meeting.
"It's 200 years of tradition and precedent.
There are a lot of issues to consider," Snowe told reporters.
The White House is taking the position that it wants no compromise and is insisting on an up or down vote on each of its nominees.
Activist groups on the left and right have grown increasingly intent on helping to shape the judiciary in recent years, as rulings on abortion, school prayer and other topics have stirred deep controversy.
Stakes are especially high this year, senators say, as many expect the first Supreme Court vacancy in more than a decade.
The filibuster rarely figured in judicial fights until Bush's first term, when Democrats used it to keep 10 appellate court nominees from having confirmation votes.
Under a filibuster, a determined minority can keep a measure or a nomination from being approved if it can muster 41 votes against.
The Republicans want to eliminate the filibuster for judicial nominees, making it possible to approve judges with 51 votes an approach known as the "nuclear option" because of the potential impact on Senate comity.
On the Senate floor Wednesday, GOP leaders charged that Democrats have abused the filibuster by using it on several judicial nominations, which they said was not a part of Senate traditions.
Democrats responded by saying the filibuster is a hallowed tool that protects minority rights.
"I do not rise for party.
I rise for principle," Frist said moments after calling up Owen's nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.
When he spoke of killing nominees, however, Democratic Whip Richard Durbin, Ill., hurried to the floor and admonished Frist to "choose words carefully."
He cited the appearance Wednesday morning before the Senate Judiciary Committee of U.S. District Court Judge Joan Lefkow, whose husband and mother were recently murdered.
Some Republicans are trying to convince Democrats that, even if every pending judge were given an up or down vote, it isn't a foregone conclusion all seven would be confirmed.
"Some of them wouldn't make it," Graham said.
If all Democrats and independent James Jeffords, Vt., voted against a nominee, six Republicans would have to join them or 11 Republicans would have to be absent for the nomination to fail in the Senate, where Republicans hold 55 seats.
Other Republican senators simply want to proceed with a vote on changing the rules on filibustering judicial nominations because, win or lose, the matter would be put to rest.
"We need to clear it up," said Sen Orrin Hatch, R Utah.
Hatch, along with other conservative GOP senators, doesn't want to compromise if it means choosing which nominees would be approved and which rejected.
"I think there will be an uproar on our side if we throw anybody overboard," Hatch said.
(Begin optional trim) In a floor speech, Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter, R Pa., traced the politicization of the confirmation process to 1987, when Democrats took over the Senate and the confirmation rate for Circuit Court nominees fell to 65 percent from 89 percent earlier in the Reagan administration.
The first President Bush's lower court nominees took an average of 100 days to confirm, twice the average duration under the Carter administration.
But when Republicans took control of the Senate during the Clinton presidency, "we exacerbated the pattern of delay and blocking nominations," Specter said, by pushing the average duration to 192 days for district court nominees and 262 days for circuit court nominees.
Seventy of Clinton's nominees were blocked through holds or other procedural maneuvers.
Then Democrats filibustered 10 of Bush's nominees, seven of which have been renominated.
"Against this background of bitter and angry recriminations, with each party serially trumpeting the other party to get even or really to dominate, the Senate now faces dual threats" the filibuster and the "nuclear" option, Specter said.
It is a confrontation of "mutually assured destruction," he added.
Staff writers Dan Balz and Spencer S. Hsu contributed to this report.
An outspoken conservative California judge criticized by Democrats as the most extreme of the president's judicial nominees won confirmation to the nation's most important appellate court Wednesday in a largely party line Senate vote.
In a vote that had been blocked by a Democratic filibuster for the past two years, the Senate approved, 56 43, the appointment of Janice Rogers Brown to the powerful U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Brown became the second of three long stalled judicial nominees who will win Senate votes because of a deal struck by 14 moderate senators to avert a partisan showdown over the Democrats' filibusters of the president's judge nominees.
Late last month, the long delayed nomination of Texas state judge Priscilla Owen to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans was approved in the Senate under the deal.
And the Senate voted Wednesday 67 32 to end debate, and foreclose any more filibustering, on the nomination to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta of former Alabama State's Attorney William Pryor.
A vote on him is expected Thursday or Friday.
Majority Leader Bill Frist, whose bid to strip Democrats of their use of the filibuster on judges was undercut by moderates, praised the confirmation of Brown, saying, "Principle has won a victory over partisan judicial obstruction."
Indeed, Republicans can claim a victory by forcing a vote and confirming three judicial nominees adamantly opposed by Democrats and considered by liberals to be too ideologically conservative.
"They are getting what they want," said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia.
"Now the question is what do the Democrats get out of this agreement?"
Democrats have accepted the deal by the seven Republican and seven Democratic moderates because it preserves their right to use a filibuster against judicial nominees, though only in "extraordinary circumstances."
That will matter most if there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, a possibility widely seen as likely given the serious illness of Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
The Senate opened debate Monday on President Bush's contentious nomination of California State Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown to the federal bench, with Republicans praising her as a "great talent" while Democrats derided her as a conservative ideologue.
The arguments were familiar ones concerning Brown.
First nominated to the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia by Bush in 2003, she was among several presidential choices Democrats blocked through filibuster threats during his first term.
Bush renominated her earlier this year.
Republican Senate leaders wanted to strip Democrats of their right to filibuster judicial nominees until a compromise in late May among centrists in both parties cleared the way for votes on some of the disputed nominees, including Brown.
A vote to end debate on Brown, known as "cloture," is expected Tuesday, and Brown's confirmation vote could come as early as Wednesday.
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R Tenn., on Monday said Brown, the first black woman to serve on the California Supreme Court, rose to the top of the legal profession through "great achievement and great talent."
Frist noted that she was the daughter of an Alabama sharecropper.
Her father also spent much of his career in the Air Force.
Frist said that, "After being delayed for two years by partisan obstruction (Brown's nomination) will finally get an up or down vote, which she deserves."
Democrats, even as they took note of the agreement to end the filibuster of Brown, urged senators to vote against her confirmation, based on her legal record.
Sen Barbara Boxer, D Calif., criticized Brown for taking an extremely limited view of government regulation in opinions that argued for rolling back the Social Security programs or zoning ordinances.
"It's not her life that I attack when I say I'm not for Janice Rogers Brown.
It's what she will do to your life," Boxer said, referring to the public.
She added, "Packing the courts with people like this will set our country back."
Brown's nomination is opposed by most black members of Congress, all of whom are Democrats.
"Both in her court decisions and in her many writings, Ms Brown rejects the civil rights remedies Congress has enacted and that the courts have approved ,and believes that parts of ,the 1964 Civil Rights Act are unconstitutional," Rep Melvin L. Watt, D N.C., chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in a statement.
At a news conference, Democratic leader Harry Reid, D Nev., accused Bush of entangling Congress in a conflict over judicial nominations by sending the Senate controversial nominees like Brown instead of consensus candidates.
"This whole legislative year, we have yet to spend a single minute debating health care, debating education, debating the environment, debating the things that people in America feel important," Reid said.
"That's too bad.
These radical judges don't deserve the attention that these other issues do."
Republicans have responded to such criticism by accusing Democrats of unfairly using the filibuster to thwart Bush and a GOP controlled Senate from filling vacancies on the federal bench.
The controversy over confirming federal judges appears to have taken a toll on the public's approval of Congress.
In a Gallup poll released Monday, just 22 percent of respondents said they have "a great deal" or "quite a lot" of confidence in Congress the lowest rating since 1997 and down from 30 percent last year.
Fifty one percent of respondents said they have "some" confidence, and 26 percent said they have "very little" or "none."
Gallup said Congress ranks with big business and organized labor among 15 institutions tested, and only slightly better than the lowest rated institution, health maintenance organizations.
The poll of 1000 adults had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
Republicans filed a motion Friday to end debate on the nomination of Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen to the federal bench, a move starting the countdown to the so called nuclear option.
The motion schedules for Tuesday the long anticipated showdown over whether Democrats have the right to use the parliamentary tactic known as the filibuster to block President Bush's judicial nominations.
Before filing the motion, Sen John Cornyn, R Texas, accused Democrats of exaggerating when they call the dispute a "constitutional crisis."
"This is a controversy, but not a crisis," Cornyn said.
"And I hope that in the coming days, we will complete our debate and resolve the controversy in a respectful manner, consistent with the greatest traditions of the United States Senate."
But the Republican push to ban the filibuster for judicial nominees has become known as the nuclear option because of the partisan discord it would spark in the Senate.
Democrats, for instance, have threatened to stall much of the chamber's business if the ban is adopted.
A group of a dozen senators still held out hope Friday of averting the showdown by refusing to lend their votes to either side.
Six Republicans and six Democrats are discussing a draft agreement under which Democrats would pledge not to use the filibuster in the future, except under "extraordinary circumstances."
In return, Republicans would pledge not to lend their votes to the effort to change the filibuster rules, unless at some point they think the Democrats had violated the spirit of the agreement.
In addition, five of seven Bush nominees to the federal appellate courts would be given confirmation votes.
And the senators would call on the White House to consult with the chamber in advance of submitting nominations, especially those to the Supreme Court.
Sen Robert C. Byrd, D W.Va., has revived a proposal to have the Senate Judiciary Committee, perhaps with the advice of an independent commission, provide the president with a list of potential nominees who would have bipartisan support.
Sen Lamar Alexander, R Tenn., said Friday that perhaps 80 percent of senators, while unwilling to buck party leaders by signing onto the compromise, nonetheless hoped it succeeds.
"This oncoming train wreck is bad for the Senate, it is bad for the country, it is bad for the Democrats and it is bad for the Republicans," he said on the Senate floor.
"We look pretty silly lecturing Iraq on how to set up a government when we can't even decide on having an up or down vote on President Bush's judicial nominees."
Senate Republican and Democratic leaders have said they would accept no deal that violates their fundamental principles: for Republicans, that all judicial nominees be allowed confirmation votes that are decided by a simple majority, for Democrats, that no changes be made in the rules governing the filibuster.
The filibuster is the right of senators to engage in extended debate on an issue.
It takes 60 votes to end debate in the 100 seat chamber.
The debate on Owen's nomination to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans began Wednesday.
Democrats are attempting to thwart a confirmation vote of her because they view her as an "extremist" conservative.
Democrats have used the filibuster threat to block 10 of Bush's appellate court nominees during his first term.
Bush renominated seven of them, including Owen and California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown.
Republicans say using the filibusters on so many nominees is unprecedented and breaks 200 years of tradition.
Democrats say the president's decision to renominate so many judges unacceptable to them is unprecedented.
They also say GOP plans to change the filibuster rules will rend Senate traditions that protect the rights of the minority party.
Since there are 44 Democrats and an independent who usually sides with them in the Senate, Republicans are expected to lose Tuesday's vote to end debate on Owen's nomination.
At that point, party leaders say they will conduct a series of maneuvers to establish a new procedure for confirming judges.
Vice President Dick Cheney is expected to preside over the session in his capacity as president of the Senate, in case his vote is needed to break a tie.
(Optional add end) First, Majority Leader Bill Frist, R Tenn., would ask Cheney for a ruling on whether senators should have a right to vote on whether to proceed to a confirmation vote.
Cheney is expected to rule in favor of Frist, and Democratic leader Harry Reid, D Nev., is expected to object.
Senators would then vote on whether to table, or reject, the Democratic objection.
Since Republicans are in the majority, the objection would likely be rejected.
At that point, Frist would ask senators to vote on whether to proceed to a final confirmation vote, which would likely pass, and then he would ask senators to vote on Owen's confirmation.
Both votes would require a simple majority of 51.
The result of Cheney's ruling, followed by the three votes, would be to establish a new parliamentary procedure for considering judicial nominations that would bypass a cloture vote to end debate, thereby making the filibuster useless as a stalling static.
In contrast to the previous days, debate on the Senate floor had a desultory air Friday, as senators saved their remaining ammunition for the coming week.
Senate aides said that debate on Monday would begin in the afternoon and could last deep into the night.
Meanwhile, Sen Rick Santorum, R Pa., issued an apology for remarks on the Senate floor the previous day in which he invoked the name of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler in criticizing Democrats.
"Referencing Hitler was meant to dramatize the principle of an argument, not to characterize my Democratic colleagues," Santorum said, in a statement.
"It was a mistake and I meant no offense."
The Senate voted 56 43 to elevate conservative California jurist Janice Rogers Brown to the nation's most important federal appeals court Wednesday, the second of President Bush's controversial nominees to win confirmation under a special agreement between centrist Republicans and Democrats.
Brown, 55, a member of the California Supreme Court, won confirmation after nearly two years of efforts by Democrats to deny her a lifetime appointment to the federal bench, contending that she has ignored legal precedents with rulings that promote an ultra conservative political agenda.
But her Republican supporters have countered that she is a model of judicial restraint, and in nearly every speech from the Senate floor in recent weeks, they have lauded her rise from a poor childhood in segregated Alabama to prominence as a judge.
But while many white Republican senators praised Brown as a role model for African Americans, the only African American in the Senate, Barak Obama, D Ill., voted against her and cautioned that Brown was not deserving of support "just because she is a black woman."
Before the vote, members of the Congressional Black Caucus walked into the Senate to demonstrate their opposition to Brown.
"Send a message that extremists are unacceptable to the federal judiciary," Rep Melvin Watt, D N.C., said in a statement.
The Senate vote clears the way for Brown to take a seat on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, one of 12 courts of appeal in the federal judiciary, but the only one with special jurisdiction over legal challenges arising from decisions and rules of federal agencies located in Washington.
The Senate also voted 67 32 to end debate on Bush's nomination of former Alabama attorney general William Pryor to a permanent seat on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Atlanta.
Pryor has been serving on the court under a temporary appointment since February 2004.
By ending debate on Pryor's nomination, the Senate set the stage for his confirmation as well, probably Thursday, the last confirmation vote guaranteed under an agreement reached by the "Gang of 14" senators from both parties to avoid a potentially damaging fight over the Senate's rules on debate.
The agreement, while granting a floor vote to long stalled Bush judicial nominees Brown, Pryor and Priscilla Owen, confirmed to a seat on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, also preserved the right of the Democratic minority to filibuster future nominees under undefined "extraordinary conditions."
Whether such conditions will be present after Pryor's floor vote is unclear, but Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R Tenn., has reiterated he will undertake special and controversial procedures to prevent any further filibusters of judicial nominees by the Democrats.
But immediately after Wednesday's votes, Frist said the Senate had "broken the impasse" on judicial nominees and, after confirmation votes on Pryor and a handful of non controversial pending nominations, the Senate will begin work on energy legislation, probably next week.
"The American people will know we're doing the nation's business," added Frist.
Congressional approval ratings have plummeted this spring, and Democrats have charged that the Republican controlled Senate has spent too much time on Bush's judicial nominees instead of dealing with the country's problems.
"We've spent endless hours, endless days, too many weeks debating radical judges and Republican attempts to abuse power," Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D Nev., said.
Four polls conducted last month found Congress with its lowest levels of public support in more than a decade.
The fight over the nominees has not only dominated the work of the Senate but has deepened the political divide in the nation's capital because of the potential the president has to reshape the federal government in his conservative image through such lifetime appointments.
And the Senate vote confirming Brown produced a flood of responses from interest groups reflecting that political divide.
"It is a sad day for the Senate and for Americans who are counting on senators to fulfill their constitutional duty to evaluate every judicial nominee carefully and confirm only those who will uphold Americans' constitutional rights and legal protections," said Ralph Neas, president of People For The American Way, the group most active in opposing her nomination.
"The Senate has set a standard for fairness with Janice Rogers Brown and we expect the same for the remaining judicial nominees," said Tony Perkins, president of Family Research Council, a Washington organization that has rallied evangelical Christians to the cause of confirming Bush's nominees.
Both sides are especially interested in the possibility of a Supreme Court vacancy this summer.

The Senate ended the filibuster of California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown Tuesday when 10 Democrats crossed party lines and voted to close debate, clearing the way for a confirmation vote Wednesday on her nomination to the second most powerful court in the country.
The motion to end debate, known as "cloture," passed by a vote of 65 32, more than enough to clear the 60 vote threshold required.
Brown is expected to be the second long stalled judge confirmed after a bipartisan group of maverick and traditionalist senators cut their own deal last month to break an impasse over confirming President Bush's picks for the federal courts.
Bush nominated Brown to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the main appeals court for government related litigation.
The court is often seen as a steppingstone to the Supreme Court.
With a 55 seat majority in the 100 member chamber, Republicans have enough votes to confirm Brown unless they break ranks.
During debate Tuesday, Democrats urged their Republican colleagues to abandon the party's position and vote against Brown, whom they repeatedly described as "out of the mainstream."
They accused her of infusing her court decisions with conservative ideology and opposing most forms of government regulation.
"I would hope that Republican senators would look at Janice Rogers Brown for what she really is," Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D Nev., told reporters after the vote.
"I don't know if I've ever known a more activist member of the judiciary, anyplace."
Democrats had blocked a confirmation vote on Brown since November 2003 by refusing to end debate, a tactic known as the filibuster.
Seven Democrats joined with seven Republicans last month and agreed not to continue the filibuster on Brown and several other judges, including Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen, who was confirmed last month to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
Seven of the 10 Democrats who voted to end debate on Brown were signers of the moderates' pact: Sen Robert Byrd of West Virginia, Sen Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, Sen Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Sen Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, Sen Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Sen Mark Pryor of Arkansas, and Sen Ken Salazar of Colorado.
They were joined by three other centrist Democrats in voting to cut off the debate on Brown: Sen Thomas Carper of Delaware, Sen Kent Conrad of North Dakota, and Sen Bill Nelson of Florida.
Following Brown, three more judicial nominations are on the Senate docket for action this week: Alabama Attorney General William Pryor, nominated for the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, and Richard Griffin and David McKeague, both of Michigan and both nominated to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Detroit.
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R Tenn., said he expected a confirmation vote on Pryor and the two Michigan nominees on Thursday.
"The reason we're spending this whole week on judges is to demonstrate that we have returned, now, to where we were before the last Congress: fair up or down vote," Frist told reporters.
"And you'll see it today, you'll see it tomorrow, you'll see it the next day."
The fate of two other circuit court nominees William Myers to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, and Henry Saad to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Detroit was not addressed by the moderates' compromise and remains uncertain.
Frist said they were not on the Senate calendar for the near future.
Before moving to Myers, " I want to make sure the process works," Frist said.
"It worked with Priscilla Owen.
It is working with Janice Rogers Brown.
It's going to work with William Pryor.
It's going to work with the Michigan judges,And then we'll just proceed down the line in regular order."
The US Senate voted Tuesday to end debate on one of President George W. Bush's most controversial judicial nominees, averting a possible showdown.
The Senate voted 81 18 to end the filibuster over the nomination of Texas Supreme Court justice Priscilla Owen to a federal judgeship.
It was expected to vote for her confirmation later in the day.
Bush nominated Owen to a seat on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals in his first term, but the nomination has been blocked four times by Democratic filibusters.
The breakthrough came only after 14 moderate senators reached a compromise over Bush's stalled judicial nominees on Monday.
Under the deal, Democrats agreed to vote for cloture, or an end to debate, for three judicial nominees: Janice Rogers Brown, William Pryor and Owen.
The Republicans, for their parts, said they would oppose any attempt to make changes in the application of filibuster rules.
Republicans have threatened to strip Democrats of their right to filibuster, or make an extended debate for delaying legislative action.
Democrats blocked 10 of Bush's 218 nominees in his first term by using filibuster.
Republicans had accused Democrats of unprecedented obstruction, but Democrats said the nominees were too conservative to decide on social and cultural issues.
If Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee decides to exercise the "nuclear option" to end a filibuster of President Bush's judicial nominees, here is how it is likely to unfold, motion by motion: The Senate will begin debate on one of the nominees, most likely Priscilla Owen of Texas or Janice Rogers Brown of California.
At some arbitrary point in the debate, the majority leader will seek a ruling from the presiding officer of the Senate "regarding the appropriate length of time for debate" on the nominee.
The majority leader's point of order will maintain that further debate on the nomination is "dilatory."
The presiding officer, who is likely to be Vice President Cheney, the president of the Senate under the U.S. Constitution, will sustain the majority leader's point of order.
The presiding officer could seek the advice of the Senate Parliamentarian before sustaining the majority leader's point of order, but it is not required.
A member of the Senate, probably Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, will object to the ruling of the presiding officer as contrary to the rules and precedents of the Senate, which currently require a vote of 60 senators to invoke cloture, that is, bring an end to debate.
At this crucial point, the majority leader will offer a nondebatable motion to table the appeal from the minority leader.
The Senate will then vote on the motion, and a simple majority vote of the 100 member Senate will sustain the ruling of the presiding officer.
If the Senate is split 50 50 on the motion, the vice president will vote to break the tie and sustain his own ruling.
The Senate would then be poised to vote on the judicial nominee.

Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist on Tuesday moved the chamber closer to a long threatened showdown between Republicans and Democrats over President Bush's controversial judicial nominations.
Frist, R Tenn., said he intends to bring the first of several of Bush's nominations to the Senate floor for a vote after the chamber passes a transportation funding bill, which is expected by the end of this week.
"Now is the time to address" the judicial issue, Frist said at his weekly news conference.
Democrats are threatening to filibuster three of the four judicial nominees currently awaiting confirmation by the Senate.
As soon as Democrats call a filibuster on one of them, Frist has said he will move to change the rules of the Senate to prohibit use of the procedure to block the confirmation votes.
It takes 60 votes to cut off a filibuster.
During Bush's first term, Democrats used the threat of a filibuster to block votes on 10 of his choices for federal appellate courts, charging the nominees were "extremist" in their conservative views.
Democrats participated in the confirmation of about 200 judicial nominees.
Earlier this year, Bush renominated seven of those who were blocked.
If the rule change on the filibuster passes, it would clear the way for all of the Bush nominees to have up or down votes on their appointments.
To win confirmation, they would need 51 votes in the 100 seat Senate.
Republicans accuse Democrats of breaking Senate tradition by resorting to the filibuster threat to block judges.
Democrats accuse Bush and his Republican allies of breaking tradition by continuing to push for controversial choices.
Frist declined to say which nominee he expected to bring up first for a vote a choice that would determine how rapidly the confrontation escalates.
Earlier this week, Sen Harry Reid, the minority leader from Nevada, urged Frist to defuse tensions by proceeding with one of the less controversial nominees.
He suggested starting with Thomas Griffith, who Bush has picked to serve on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Griffith is one of the four nominees pending before the Senate.
Reid said that although many Democrats oppose still him, they would not organize a filibuster against him.
On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to send a fifth nominee to the Senate floor William H. Pryor Jr., who was renominated by Bush to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
Although Democrats filibustered his nomination in the past, they have signaled that they will not do so again.
"We don't like any of those five," Reid said.
"But in an effort to work toward saving this institution ,I would be willing to give up on any one of those five."
But that left open the prospect that Democrats would filibuster Bush's other controversial nominees.
The other nominees pending before the full Senate are California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown, Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen a favorite among conservative activists and William Myers, a former ranching and mining lobbyist.
Republican leaders have sent conflicting signals about which of the nominees they would likely bring to the floor first.
In his comments to reporters, Frist singled out Owen for praise, saying that "it is just wrong that we do not allow her, after four years (since she was first nominated), that courtesy of an up or down vote."
But a short while later, former California Gov. Pete Wilson appeared at the Republicans' weekly policy luncheon to brief his former Senate colleagues about Brown, who served for three years as his legal affairs advisor.
Afterward, Wilson said he believes Democrats are trying to "demonize" her, comparing her nomination to that of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
Brown and Thomas are both black.
"I think that is most anathema to her Democratic critics they don't like the idea of articulate conservatives and they particularly don't like when it's a person of color," Wilson said.
"I don't think that's a new phenomenon here."
Both sides acknowledge that the central issue is less the current list of nominees than the looming possibility of a Supreme Court vacancy later this year.
"This fight is not about the seven radical nominations," Reid told reporters.
"It's about clearing the way for a Supreme Court nominee who only needs 51 votes, not 60," for confirmation.
Frist said that Republicans "have to look to the future to see that nominees for ,the circuit court level and the Supreme Court have that opportunity for an up or down vote."
Leaders on both sides said Tuesday they saw little room for a deal to avert the confrontation.
A divided Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday sent two controversial appeals court nominees toward a showdown vote in the Senate, setting the stage for what Democrats described as a looming "constitutional crisis" over President Bush's judicial nominations.
With Democrats forming a solid wall of dissent, the Republican dominated committee voted 10 8 to revive the long dormant nominations of Priscilla Owen of Texas and Janice Rogers Brown of California.
The two were blocked by threatened Democratic filibusters during the last session of Congress.
The action propels the Senate toward a volatile, partisan confrontation, with Republicans contemplating a rules change that would prohibit further judicial filibusters and enable Bush to win Senate confirmation of his embattled court appointees.
Democrats describe the rules change as a "nuclear option" and are threatening to slow down Senate business if Republicans persist.
"This is an important and historic meeting," declared Sen Charles Schumer, D N.Y. "We're in the ramp up to a great constitutional crisis."
Republicans, who have a majority in the 100 member Senate, say the time has come to end what they describe as politically motivated obstructionist tactics by Democrats and sustain the president's right to send his nominees to the bench.
Democrats, in turn, say they have helped confirm 205 judicial nominees but object to a handful who are either unqualified or too extreme to hold life time judicial appointments.
Owen, a Texas Supreme Court justice nominated to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, has been held up for nearly four years amid Democratic allegations that she injected anti abortion sentiments into her opinions and consistently handed down rulings that penalized consumers and favored big business.
Her supporters dismiss those characterizations as groundless, describing the former Houston attorney as fair minded and more than qualified.
The American Bar Association gave Owen its highest recommendation in examining her qualifications for nomination.
"She deserves to be confirmed," said Sen John Cornyn, R Texas, a member of the committee.
"She's waited four years for an up and down vote in the United States Senate."
"The way she's been treated is less than humane," said Sen Orrin Hatch, R Utah.
But leading Democrats stood firm in their opposition to Owen.
"Nothing has changed since we last reviewed her record to make Justice Owen worthy of confirmation now," said Sen Edward M. Kennedy, D Mass. "If anything, her decisions since then only confirm that she should not receive a life time position on the 5th Circuit."
Schumer said he was "proud to oppose this nomination."
Brown, who now serves on the California Supreme Court, was nominated to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia, which deals with cases involving much of the federal government and is often described as second only to the Supreme Court in importance.
Democrats said that she would use the bench to advance "extremist" conservative views, but Sen Jeff Sessions, R Ala., countered that the jurist is independent and hard working, "with an open mind" and "a lot of common sense."
Senate rules require 60 votes to stop a filibuster, traditionally long winded speeches designed to block or delay Senate action.
The rules change being considered by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R Tenn., would allow a simple 51 vote majority to end a filibuster.
Republicans have 55 votes, compared to 44 for Democrats and one for the lone independent senator, Jim Jeffords of Vermont.

WASHINGTON Moderate Democratic and Republican senators met into the evening Tuesday night in the hopes of avoiding a showdown over filibusters of judicial nominees, as Republican leaders planned to launch a carefully choreographed debate on the issue of judges Wednesday that they hope will bring public opinion to their side.
About a dozen senators met behind closed doors with Senate majority leader Bill Frist and Senate minority leader Harry Reid for about an hour late Tuesday afternoon to discuss the framework of the proposed compromise.
However, a senior Democratic aide said Tuesday night that the two leaders left the meeting as far apart as ever, though that does not foreclose the possibility of rank and file members reaching an agreement on their own.
Senator Ben Nelson, a Nebraska Democrat who is among the leaders of the group seeking a compromise, emerged from the meeting saying they were drawing close to a deal but remained short of persuading the six Democrats and six Republicans they need to seal the deal.
The agreement under discussion would bind the Republicans to preserving Democrats' right to filibuster judges, on the condition that Democrats only use filibusters in "extreme circumstances," Nelson said.
Still undecided, however, is the fate of eight men and women the White House has already nominated for judgeships and Democratic leaders have promised to filibuster.
Under the deal, "There'll be judicious use of the filibuster, and you won't have a nuclear option a banning of filibusters in this session of Congress," Nelson told reporters after the meeting.
It remained unclear Tuesday whether Frist would sign off on such a deal, however.
The Tennessee Republican refused to comment on his way out of the meeting, but has said he will not take any deal that doesn't guarantee votes for all nominees on the Senate floor.
In addition, Frist is under pressure from conservatives to ban filibusters before a vacancy arises on the Supreme Court, and the proposed agreement would not accomplish that.
As of Tuesday night, Frist remained on track to force the issue on the Senate floor, starting Wednesday morning.
Frist is moving to confirm two female judges with compelling life stories, making it more difficult for Democrats to stand against them.
Republicans plan to stretch debate over several days and make a show of trying to cut the Democrats off through normal procedures, a move intended to highlight the perception of Democratic obstructionism, Republican senators said.
"When you want to score, you run your best plays," said Senator George Allen, Republican of Virginia.
"And if it's tough for the Democrats, that's fine with me."
Frist will bring up the nominations of Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown Wednesday through the Senate's regular operating rules, but a vote is unlikely to happen before next Tuesday or Wednesday, according to Frist's top aides.
Frist hosted Owen and Rogers Brown for a photo opportunity Tuesday at his office shortly after the two met with President Bush at the White House.
"Our simple goal is to restore that 214 years of tradition to allow these nominees a simple, fair up or down vote," Frist said at a news conference.
Democrats are fighting back by citing inflammatory statements and decisions handed down by Owen and Rogers Brown.
They are planning a series of public events to state opposition to the judges, and to any rules change that would make their confirmations possible.
Under Senate rules, as few as 41 senators can force unlimited debate through a procedure known as a filibuster, effectively killing a nomination.
Democrats used that power to scuttle 10 of Bush's 218 judicial nominees in his first term, and have vowed to do the same to defeat at least the seven he has re nominated this year.
Frist has promised to use a parliamentary maneuver that would outlaw those filibusters, in essence lowering the threshold for confirmation from 60 votes to 50 votes.
Conservatives are anxious for the rules to be changed before a Supreme Court vacancy, but Democrats have vowed to slow Senate business to a crawl in response.
The proposed compromise being spearheaded by Nelson and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona would probably be acceptable to Reid if it preserves Democrats' ability to filibuster judges in the future, according to aides to the Democratic leader.
If the future of filibusters comes to a vote in the Senate, neither side is sure of the outcome.
Frist's maneuver needs 50 votes to succeed, and while Republicans control 55 Senate seats, two senators have announced plans to side with the Democrats and at least half a dozen others are publicly undecided.

Moderate Democrats and Republicans failed Tuesday to derail a confrontation over federal judgeships that both sides said would begin playing out Wednesday on the floor of the Senate.
Republican leaders said they would start the day's Senate session by fopening debate on President Bush's nomination of Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen to the federal appeals court in New Orleans.
The nomination of California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown to the federal appeals court in the District of Columbia also will be discussed in the coming days, but Republicans have decided to focus on Owen in their dispute with Democrats over judicial nominees.
Democrats previously used filibusters to block the nominations of Owen and Brown and have said they would seek to do so again, setting the stage for the Senate showdown.
Bush turned up the heat on the issue, saying Tuesday night that senators have "a duty to promptly consider each of these nominees on the Senate floor, discuss and debate their qualifications, and then give them the up or down vote they deserve" rather than filibuster them.
Bush's remarks to 1500 donors attending a Republican Party fund raising gala represented an escalation of the administration's campaign to pressure the Senate to act.
In the hours before the parliamentary battle was to begin, the spotlight shone on a dozen or so centrists from both parties who discussed a potential compromise to defuse the dispute.
After an hour and a half of discussions Tuesday evening that included Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R Tenn., and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D Nev., the meeting broke up with no progress reported.
The lead Democrat in the effort, Sen Ben Nelson of Nebraska, told reporters that talks would continue.
"Every time you talk, you gain ground, you don't lose ground," Nelson said.
The confrontation has been building for years as each party has used various methods to thwart the other party's nominations to the federal courts.
In recent years, Democrats used the filibuster in which a senator's right to extended debate is used as a stalling tactic to block votes on 10 of Bush's nominations to federal appellate courts.
Democrats argued that those judges were conservative ideologues.
Currently, 60 votes are needed to end a filibuster and force a confirmation vote, Republicans want to lower the threshold to 51 votes for judicial nominees.
"I really think people on both sides don't want this to happen," said Sen Joe Lieberman, D Conn., one of those working for a compromise.
"Members on both sides don't want the explosion to occur."
The proposed compromise, brokered by Nelson and Sen John McCain, R Ariz., would be a pact between six Republicans and six Democrats to vote together to end filibusters of the stalled judicial nominees but also oppose any change in the rules permitting such filibusters.
Republicans hold 55 seats in the 100 member Senate, so six GOP defectors would be enough to deny Frist a majority vote on the filibuster issue.
Owen and Brown, the two judges at the heart of the Republican campaign against the filibuster, were in Washington Tuesday.
They had lunch at the White House with Bush's chief counsel, Harriet Miers, dropped by the Oval Office for a brief visit with Bush and then made a carefully orchestrated appearance on Capitol Hill.
The confrontation is expected to play out over the coming week in stages and culminate early next week.
Owen is a favorite of abortion opponents and religious conservatives because of several legal opinions she wrote denying minors the right to an abortion without parental notification.
Brown, who is black, is considered more likely to attract the support of independents and Republican moderates.
A senior Frist aide said Tuesday that Brown's nomination will move to the Senate floor after confirmation votes for Owen and John R. Bolton, Bush's nominee for U.N. ambassador.
As a result, Brown's confirmation battle is unlikely to reach the Senate floor until after Memorial Day.
The aide spoke on condition of anonymity because the scenario was preliminary.
The second stage is expected to begin Friday, the aide said, when Republicans will file a motion to end debate on Owen.
Two days later, the Senate will hold a vote on the motion, known as "cloture," which requires 60 votes.
Republicans are expected to lose that vote, at which point Frist will begin the climactic chapter, according to his aide.
With Vice President Dick Cheney presiding over the chamber in his capacity as president of the Senate, Frist will make a motion suggesting that senators should have the right to vote on judicial nominees after a certain number of hours of debate have passed.
Cheney is expected to uphold the motion, Democrats are expected to object, and the chamber will vote on whether to table, or reject, the Democratic appeal.
All those votes require a simple majority, the aide said, and Cheney could break a possible tie.
Frist's motion would establish a precedent, he said, under which all judicial nominations would get a vote after a certain amount of debate and confirmation would require 51 votes.
The precedent would apply to all federal judges, including the Supreme Court.
Times staff writers Mary Curtius, Richard Simon, Edwin Chen and Warren Vieth contributed to this report.
Top Senate leaders declared an unsuccessful end to their compromise talks over President George W. Bush's stalled judicial nominees, despite fresh talk of a deal to clear five appeals court appointees while scuttling three others.
"I've tried to compromise and they want all or nothing, and I can't do that," Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada told reporters after a private meeting Monday with Majority Leader Bill Frist.
"We both agreed that after several months of discussions, we have been unable to come to a negotiated position where the president's nominees get an up or down vote," Frist said.
By their comments, the two party leaders pushed the Senate closer to a historic confrontation that could decide the fate of the appeals court candidates, Supreme Court nominees during Bush's term and the Senate's venerable filibuster rules as well.
Democrats prevented final votes on 10 of Bush's first term appeals court nominees, and have threatened to do the same this year to seven whom the president renominated.
Frist has threatened to change Senate procedures to strip them of their ability to do so.
At issue is the filibuster, a parliamentary device that can be overcome only by a majority of 60 votes or higher in the 100 member Senate.
Frist and Reid reached their self declared dead end at the same time a small group of Democrats, who have been meeting with Republicans also eager to avoid a showdown, floated a proposal to clear the way for confirmation of some of Bush's blocked appointees.
Under the proposal, circulated in writing, Republicans would have to pledge no change through 2006 in the Senate's rules that allow filibusters against judicial nominees.
For their part, Democrats would commit not to block votes on Bush's Supreme Court or appeals court nominees during the same period, except in extreme circumstances.
Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said Democrats involved in the compromise would vote to end any filibuster blocking a final vote on Richard Griffin, David McKeague and Susan Neilson, all named to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Democrats would also clear the way for final votes on William H. Pryor Jr. for the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and Janice Rogers Brown for the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Both are among the nominees most strongly opposed by organized labor as well as civil rights and abortion rights groups and others that provide political support for the Democratic Party.
Three other nominations would continue to be blocked under the offer: those of Henry Saad to the 6th Circuit Court, Priscilla Owen to the 5th Circuit and William G. Myers III to the 9th Circuit.
Individual Democrats would be free to decide for themselves what constituted an extreme case for future nominees, according to officials familiar with the proposal.
At the same time, Republicans would be bound to leave filibuster practices in effect.
Nebraska Sen Ben Nelson, a Democrat seeking re election in a Republican state, outlined the suggested compromise for Frist on Sunday night at a dinner at the Tennessee Republican's home.
Nelson also has spoken with Reid.
Frist has said all along he will not accept any plan unless it gives each of Bush's nominees a yes or no vote.
For his part, Reid has not endorsed Nelson's proposal, which would clear the way for confirmation of one more judge than the party leader has publicly signaled he would accept.
At the same time, he met with leaders of outside groups during the day, and a representative of one organization who attended said he did not reject the terms, either.
This individual spoke on condition of anonymity.
Nelson's spokesman, David DiMartino, declined to confirm the details of the compromise offer.
Republicans hold 55 seats in the Senate, meaning they can afford five defections and still triumph.
Already, though, McCain and Sen Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island have said they will break ranks.
Vote counters on both sides have sad they expect Sen Olympia Snowe of Maine to do likewise.
Several other Republicans are publicly uncommitted, and neither side appears certain it has enough votes to prevail if the issue is put to a vote.
At the same time, if six Republicans and six Democrats agree to a compromise of their own, they could impose it on the leadership if necessary, averting a showdown.
Even Republicans who strongly opposed the Democrats' repeated use of filibusters argue that banning such moves would amount to a sweeping change in the way the Senate conducts business.
The chamber's uniqueness, they say, stems in part from the rights it preserves for the minority.
As a result, many have expressed hope that a confrontation could be avoided.
"I believe that we are skating over very thin ice here with regard to the continuity of life in the Senate as we've known it," Sen Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican, said over the weekend on CNN.
"I'm opposed to trying to eliminate filibusters simply because I think they protect minority rights, whether they're Republicans, Democrats or other people."
The Senate is getting closer to a confrontation between Republicans and Democrats over whether President George W. Bush's judicial nominees can be filibustered by senators who don't want them confirmed.
Democrats filibustered 10 nominees to the U.S. appeals courts during Bush's first term, and they have said they will do so again this year for the seven that Bush renominated.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada also said Democrats might filibuster future nominees, possibly including Bush's choice for a Supreme Court vacancy should one occur.
Here, in question and answer form, is a look at some of the issues being debated: Q: What is a filibuster?
A: The filibuster is a parliamentary tactic where senators use their right to virtually unlimited debate to block measures or legislation.
To stop a filibuster requires 60 votes.
Passing a bill or confirming a nominee requires only a simple majority, 51 senators if all 100 senators are present.
The vice president can break 50 50 ties.
Use of the term filibuster began to appear in the 1840s.
It is derived from the Dutch word vrijbuiter, or free booter, and the Spanish filibustero.
Both terms refer to pirates.
The filibuster was used in the 1950s and 1960s to impede civil rights legislation.
In 1957 Strom Thurmond launched the longest one man filibuster in history, speaking for more than 24 hours to block the Civil Rights Act of 1957.
Q: Who are the judicial nominees involved in the filibuster controversy?
A: David McKeague, Richard Griffin, Henry Saad, William G. Myers III, Janice Rogers Brown, William H. Pryor Jr. and Priscilla Owen.
Q: Why do Democrats oppose these nominees?
A: Democrats oppose McKeague, Griffin and Saad, all nominees for the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, because Republicans blocked Senate votes on former President Bill Clinton's nominees for vacancies on the same court.
They say the other four are conservative ideologues whose views against homosexuality, abortion, affirmative action, Social Security, labor rights or environmental standards are out of the mainstream.
Q: Why is this important?
A: Republicans and Democrats anticipate that at least one of the nine Supreme Court justices will retire before the end of the Bush presidency.
The outcome of the fight over judicial filibusters will determine whether a replacement needs 60 votes or merely a majority.
Social conservatives fear Bush would pick a Supreme Court candidate who doesn't oppose the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion if 60 votes are needed to win confirmation.
Q: Why don't Republicans keep the Senate in round the clock session to force Democrats to conduct the type of filibuster shown in Frank Capra's 1939 movie "Mr Smith Goes to Washington"?
A: It's more convenient merely to have a test vote to see if they have 60 votes and then move on to other issues if they don't.
Republicans also say a round the clock filibuster debate wouldn't bring them any closer to a vote on the nominees themselves.
Q: Is this the first time judicial nominees have been filibustered?
A: It depends on who you ask.
Republicans say filibusters have never been successfully used to block judicial nominees from confirmation who had majority support.
Democrats point to Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas, who was blocked from becoming chief justice in what the Senate historian's Web site calls "the first filibuster in Senate history on a Supreme Court nomination."
The attempt to force a vote on his nominaton drew fewer than 50 votes.
They also say at least two of Clinton's lower court judicial nominees were filibustered for years by Republicans, although they were ultimately confirmed.
Q: What do Republicans want to change?
A: The Republican party is talking about seeking a parliamentary ruling that declares filibusters are not permitted against judicial nominees.
That ruling would ultimately be submitted to the full Senate for a vote, with a simple majority required to prevail.
Republicans hold 55 seats in the 100 member Senate, and Vice President Dick Cheney, who also is president of the Senate, has said he will be available to break a tie, if necessary.
Q: When will Republicans do this?
A: Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican, has never said when he would try to change the filibuster rules.
However, it is expected that Republicans want the matter resolved before a retirement from the Supreme Court.
Those retirements usually come in the summer.
Frist also said he would offer Democrats a compromise before moving forward.
He offered that compromise on Thursday, 100 hours of debate on Circuit and Supreme Court nominees followed by a guaranteed confirmation vote.
Q: Democrats have threatened to slow down the work of the Senate if Republicans succeed.
How can they do this?
A: The Senate works at its current speed because much of its workload is handled through a procedure called "unanimous consent."
That means all 100 senators agree on issues like skipping the full reading of every bill, allowing committees to meet while the Senate is in session and voting on procedural Senate business.
Without unanimous consent, it could take hours or days to complete work that now takes minutes.
By opposing unanimous consent requests from Republicans, Democrats can block or delay most of what the Senate does.
Democrats have said they will not delay vital legislation like appropriation bills and homeland security bills or money for America's troops.
The Senate's Republican and Democratic leaders called for a prompt showdown in the impasse over judicial nominations Tuesday, a move that would undercut moderates' efforts to find a compromise to the long running dispute.
Both parties' leaderships are wary of a bipartisan bid by a few centrists to find a middle ground that would force GOP and Democratic leaders to accept options they have called intolerable.
Majority Leader Bill Frist, R Tenn., has said the ability to filibuster judicial nominees, now or in the future, must end.
Minority Leader Harry Reid, D Nev., meanwhile, has said the right to filibuster must remain intact and President Bush must withdraw three of his most contentious appellate court nominees.
Neither man could claim victory under compromises being promoted by Sen Ben Nelson, D Neb., among others.
Nelson said that the details of his plan remain fluid, but that it would leave the filibuster rules intact while confirming more of Bush's nominees than Reid has said his party can accept.
Nelson said senators would have to pledge to use filibusters only in "extreme or extraordinary cases."
But Republicans said Democrats have a history of labeling mainstream conservatives as extremists.
Reid and Frist said they remain open to a possible compromise.
But both men rejected elements of Nelson's plan Tuesday and signaled that they want a showdown vote on the filibuster issue often called "the nuclear option" as early as next week, if not Friday.
Frist, noting that four of the controversial nominations could be called to the Senate floor any time, told reporters that "the suggestion has been made, let's go straight through the executive calendar and deal with them one by one.
And I think it's time to do that."
Reid said Democrats "are prepared for a vote on the nuclear option."
Nelson said in an interview that his biggest challenge is to find a compromise "without undermining the leaders in both caucuses."
If a handful of Democrats broke with Reid, Nelson said, they could confirm some or all of the seven appellate court nominees thwarted by filibusters in Bush's first term and still awaiting action.
And if three more Republicans join the three who have vowed to oppose Frist's effort to ban filibusters of judicial nominees, the GOP leader would not have the 51 votes he needs to change the rule.
But with party leaders and outside interest groups pressuring senators to stick with their caucuses, Nelson said, it may prove impossible to pass his proposal.
If Republicans leave the right to filibuster judges intact, Reid has said, his caucus will let them pick one appellate court nominee for a non filibustered confirmation from a group the Democrats have strongly criticized: Janice Rogers Brown of California, William Myers III of Idaho, Priscilla Owen of Texas and William Pryor Jr. of Alabama.
Frist rejected the offer again Tuesday, saying this "is a matter of principle, and the principle is this fairness of an up or down vote" for all nominees.
Sen Trent Lott, R Miss., suggested that exploring compromises may help Frist gain the votes he will need to outlaw judicial filibusters.
Moderate GOP senators, Lott told radio talk host Tony Snow, "have to feel assured that every avenue has been explored,If every effort has been made and fails, then they will be there" when Frist calls for the showdown vote.
Senate Republicans on Tuesday rebuffed a Democratic overture aimed at ending a confrontation over federal judges, saying that any agreement must include a pledge not to filibuster future nominees especially Supreme Court nominees.
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D Nev., offered to end three of seven Democratic filibusters of President Bush's appellate court nominees if Republicans would pledge not to change Senate rules to end the use of the parliamentary tactic to stall votes on proposed judges.
But Republicans said they were less concerned about current nominees than they were about future ones, especially an anticipated Supreme Court vacancy this summer.
"Don't just focus on the past," Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R Tenn., said.
"All judicial and Supreme Court nominees deserve a fair up or down vote."
For their part, Democrats said they would accept no agreement that restricted future use of the filibuster, leaving the two sides at an impasse.
"It would be a fundamental part of any compromise that the nuclear option be off the table," said Sen Charles E. Schumer, D N.Y.
Neither side publicly discussed details of the Democratic offer.
However, a senior Democratic aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Reid offered to end filibusters on three of seven nominations stalled by Democrats two judges from Michigan and a third judicial nominee of Republicans' choice.
In return, the aide said, Reid asked for a Republican commitment not to change the filibuster rules, along with promises to re instate Judiciary committee procedures that would permit senators to block nominations during the committee vetting process.
Reid also asked that a bipartisan task force of retired senators be asked to make proposals on improving the judicial confirmation process.
"I believe my proposal strikes the right balance.
It protects our democracy and the independence of our federal courts, it protects the American people and lets us do their business, and it breaks a partisan stalemate that is unnecessary and divisive," Reid said in remarks on the Senate floor.
The talk of a compromise led to a Republican counteroffer proposed on the Senate floor by the chamber's No. 2 Republican, Majority Whip Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
McConnell acknowledged that Republicans had stalled many of former President Clinton's nominees during the committee vetting process.
He offered to change committee procedures in return for an end to judicial filibusters.
"There's a lot of finger pointing going on on both sides," McConnell said.
"This is a way to cure that."
Democrats quickly denounced McConnell's proposal.
"There would be no filibuster,That's not a compromise at all," said Schumer.
In the background of the debate was an anticipated Supreme Court confirmation battle this summer.
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist has cancer, raising questions about whether he will retire when the court session ends in June.
"I think Republicans are concerned that for the first time in history, a Supreme Court nominee might not get an up or down vote," said Sen Jeff Sessions, R Ala. "I think that's in the back of everyone's mind."
The two judges specified in Reid's offer Richard Griffin and David McKeague are among three nominees for the 6th Circuit in Michigan, a bench that has been the focus of partisan battles since the Clinton administration.
Under Reid's proposal, Republicans would have to withdraw the nomination of a third judge, Henry Saad, who has been stiffly opposed by Michigan's two senators, both Democrats: Sen Debbie Stabenow and Sen Carl Levin.
Democrats would also allow Republicans to vote on one of four remaining judicial nominees, all denounced by Democrats as conservative ideologues: Priscilla Owen, Janice Rogers Brown, William Pryor or William Myers.
After being briefed about the compromise, Levin said he was willing to end his opposition to the two Michigan nominees if it would help Reid solve the conflict.
"We're going to support his proposal," Levin said.
In an interview with USA Today published Tuesday, White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove said the White House did not support a compromise on judicial filibusters.
"We believe that every judicial nominee deserves an up or down vote," Rove said.
"The process is not well served by these political games."
Reid denounced Rove's comments as an insistence that the Senate become a rubber stamp for the president by providing a "100 percent confirmation rate."
(Optional add end) Some polls have suggested that the American public is wary about the Republican push on federal judges.
An ABC/Washington Post survey published Tuesday suggested that two thirds of Americans oppose Republican plans to change the filibuster rule and 26 percent support it.
In response, the Republican National Committee released results of internal polls that they said show that 81 percent of Americans believe Democrats should not block confirmation votes for judges even if they don't agree with them.
The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved and sent to the full Senate two of President Bush's candidates for seats on the federal appeals bench.
Sen Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who is the committee's chairman, asked his colleagues to be brief, saying there was little doubt that voting on the two candidates, Priscilla R. Owen and Janice Rogers Brown, would be along party lines.
It was as he predicted, with each of the nominees receiving favorable votes from all 10 Republicans on the committee while all 8 Democrats voted against them.
That did not discourage committee members from brushing aside Specter's plea for brevity and plunging into prolonged and angry debate about the two nominees.
Everyone understood that these candidates have come to stand for more than their own hopes to be confirmed, the two may be the test cases used by Republican leaders to change the Senate rules to prohibit filibusters to block judicial nominees.
Dating from Bush's first term, Democrats have used a filibuster or the threat of extended debate, to block 10 of the president's choices for the federal appeals courts, while approving 35 others.
Sen Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Republican leader, has warned with increasing ardor that he may seek to change the rules so that the Democrats, who are in the minority, would be unable to block Bush's judicial choices.
Both Owen, a justice on the Texas Supreme Court, and Brown, a justice on the California Supreme Court, have been blocked before by Democrats who have called them unfit for the federal bench, asserting that they are hard line conservative ideologues.
Sen Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the committee's ranking Democrat, said Owen had shown herself to be "an ends oriented activist judge" in Texas.
The debate about Owen has centered on her dissents from court rulings interpreting a state law allowing a minor to obtain an abortion without the permission of a parent in certain limited circumstances.
In one dissent, Justice Owen said the teenager in the case had not demonstrated that she knew that there were religious objections to abortion and that some women who underwent abortions had experienced severe remorse.
Alberto R. Gonzales, the attorney general, who was a member of the court at the time, said the views of the dissenters were far beyond what the Legislature had enacted and amounted to "an unconscionable act of judicial activism."
A review of the court opinions shows that other judges also asserted that Owen and her fellow dissenters were putting their own views ahead of the law.
The author of the majority opinion in the principal case, Justice Harriet O'Neill, wrote, "In deciding this case we squarely confront the question of whether, as judges, we should apply the Parental Notification Act as it is written by the Legislature or according to our own personal beliefs."
She added that, "The issue's highly charged nature does not excuse judges who impose their own personal convictions into what must be a strictly legal inquiry."
Sen Sam Brownback, R Kan., said the opinion showed Owen was "actually following the Legislature's intent.
This is the kind of judge we're looking for."
Brown was assailed by Democrats over some of her judicial opinions but also over her many speeches in which she disparages the usefulness of government.
"She has a vitriolic hostility to government," said Sen Dianne Feinstein, D Calif.
At her confirmation hearing Brown said she was not an ideologue of any stripe.
India's Supreme Court lifted Wednesday a ban on felling timber in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to allow houses to be built for thousands of tsunami survivors.
The court had imposed the ban two years ago to protect the tropical forests on the Andamans, but the devastation wreaked by the tsunami destroyed entire settlements.
Cracks and fissures have developed in many concrete buildings still standing on the islands which have been jolted by about 100 aftershocks since the December 26 earthquake off Indonesia sent tsunamis across the Indian Ocean.
Indian experts have been dispatched to the islands to build makeshift houses from bamboo and other woods, which can better withstand quakes and are less likely to injure inhabitants.
The Indian government says at least 900 people have died and more than 6000 are missing on the Andamans.
Some 40000 people have been housed in 110 relief camps on the islands, according to home ministry figures.
However, the overall picture remains uncertain with locals, police and aid workers fearing 10000 people died across the 500 plus island chain which stretches more than 800 kilometres (500 miles).
About 100 giant pandas in northwest China's Gansu Province are suffering from hunger because large tracts of arrow bamboo have bloomed and died.
By the end of 2004, arrow bamboo, the favorite food of giants, had blossomed on 7420 hectares at the Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve in southern Gansu Province, a major habitat of pandas in China, according to a recent survey conducted by the nature reserve administration.
The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered species, with an estimated 1000 living in the mountainous regions of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.
To protect the animal, dubbed China's "national treasure," the country has set up 33 nature reserves, covering a total area of 1.6 million hectares.
The Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve is home to more than 100 giant pandas.
Currently, they are threatened by a severe food shortage in the wake of the withering bamboo.
What is worse, arrow bamboo on another 1950 hectares which blossomed in 1993 has not grown tall enough for consumption.
Since it usually takes 15 years for the new plants to grow adequately to supply enough food for groups of pandas, food remains scarce for the pandas.
To help pandas tide over the difficult period, many townships in Gansu Province have set up rescue teams to care for the rare animals.
Flowering arrow bamboo is threatening a colony of endangered giant pandas in China but experts have come up with a plan to save them, state media said Monday.
Twenty two giant pandas living in parts of Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve in the northwestern province of Gansu will be moved to other locations with better food, the China Daily said, quoting Zhang Kerong, director of the reserve.
Arrow bamboo in two areas of the reserve which they inhabit is flowering, which means the plant will seed and die at the end of its life span.
Giant pandas will not eat the bamboo after it blooms and it takes 10 years for a new supply to grow.
Bamboo blooming in the early 1980s caused the deaths of about 250 giant pandas, the report said.
Zhang said the reserve will send frequent patrols and rescue giant pandas in danger of starvation, but did not say where they would go or how they would be moved.
Locals, meanwhile, have been told not to harm the animals if they enter villages looking for food.
As of late last year, the flowering bamboo covered more than 7000 hectares (17290 acres) of the 220000 hectare nature reserve and the blooming area has continued to expand.
More than 100 giant pandas live there.
To help them survive, the Baishuijiang reserve is planting more bamboo in hopes of helping the animals to increase their population.
However, a survey found that 12 percent of planted bamboo showed signs of blooming, rendering it inedible, China Daily said.
If the situation worsens all the pandas in the reserve will have to be transferred elsewhere.
Since the 1970s, many pandas in the reserve have died because of food shortages.
Currently more than 1500 giant pandas live wild in China, according to a survey by the State Forestry Administration.
The government has set up more than 50 reserves, most in the southwest province of Sichuan.
But in Sichuan and in Shaanxi province, which also has panda reserves, arrow bamboo has also been found blooming.
Giant pandas also continue to face threats from humans such as poaching, mining and logging, the report said.
The number of giant pandas has increased to 102 in the Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve in the northwestern province of Gansu, according to the latest survey conducted by the reserve authority.
The increase is attributed to more bamboo food of the pandas as a result of improved environment, a source with the nature reserve said.
In recent years, the local government has made great efforts in forest protection in the reserve.
More than 26670 hectares of farming land has been transformed into forest.
Meanwhile, large areas of revived arrow bamboo also provide more food for giant pandas.
Covering 2100 square km, the reserve now boasts 87.2 percent of the giant pandas in Gansu and 6.4 percent of the national figure.
China now has approximately 1600 giant pandas, which mainly live in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.
Ethiopian State Minister of Trade and Industry Tadesse Haile said Saturday his country has the desire to share China's experiences in bamboo processing.
He said the resource in the country was largely led to waste due to the lack of due attention to the proper utilization of bamboo.
Tadesse was speaking here at a workshop on ways of optimizing the utilization of bamboo in view of its importance in poverty reduction.
A study paper presented on the occasion said the volume of bamboo production in Ethiopia is estimated at one fourth of that produced in China.
According to the study, bamboo harvest in Ethiopia constitutes 67 percent of the total production in Africa.
Chinese Ambassador to Ethiopia Lin Lin, State Minister Tadesse and the trainees of the workshop watched displays of various furniture made from bamboo.
The Chinese government financed the training organized jointly by Ethiopia's Micro and Small Scale Trade Development Agency and a Beijing based organization.
Some 26 pertinent professionals drawn from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development as well as from other regional states have attended the workshop.
Tell someone you're planning to decorate with bamboo and they may wonder if you are taking your design cues from Ricardo Montalban and "Fantasy Island," with its Tiki bars and oversized chairs.
That image is so old that even bamboo's newer image as a sturdy alternative for hardwood flooring is showing some age, too.
Flooring is still the most likely use for bamboo in the home, but designers today are using this strong, versatile grass all over the house, for everything from kitchen cabinets to countertops, cutting boards to serving bowls, shower curtains to dining room chairs.
The appeal of bamboo is often its clean, airy look and perhaps its association with warmer climes, but there's more to it than that.
It has greater tensile strength than steel, it's a sustainable, environmentally friendly material (it grows fast enough to be harvested within three to five years without depleting natural resources, and it regenerates quickly), and it can cost less and last longer than red oak, the wood most commonly used for flooring.
What's not to like?
One company bringing fresh interpretations to bamboo is called, suitably enough, bambu.
The two year old New York firm makes bamboo bowls, cutleryand flatware, and biodegradable plates.
Fortune magazine named bambu's Veneerware plates among the 25 best products of 2004.
This year the company is introducing several new products, including a new cutting board called "the plank," a super sized stirring spoon called "the big stir," and appetizer pieces called sporks.
Founder and designer Rachel Speth and partner Jeff Delkin answered questions about bambu via e mail from Shanghai, where they live.
"When we created bambu, we set out to inform and excite people about renewable materials.
That was our goal.
But we also realized that to do that effectively, we had to create products that offered good design and aesthetic appeal at a good value," writes Speth.
"Customers have to like what it looks like, enjoy what it feels like.
Then, when they learn of all the wonderful environmental benefits of bamboo, it enhances the buying experience."
Bamboo kitchenware has come a long way from chopsticks and steamers.
Totally Bamboo, a North Hollywood company owned by Tom Sullivan and Joanne Chen, makes a wide range of laminated bamboo cutting boards, serving bowls, and utensils.
Sullivan says he's also done prototypes for bamboo dashboards and gearshift knobs in cars as well as shower curtains.
Recently, he made a bamboo guitar for a client.
Later this year the company intends to launch a line of bamboo countertops and is looking into making bamboo building materials.
"We're trying to break new ground with everything we do," Sullivan says.
Bamboo furniture designers are also breaking new ground with sleek and modern pieces that are a far cry from the kitschy look of the '60s.
Gerard Minakawa is the founder of Ukao, which means "way of life" in Swahili.
The line includes tables, seating, and custom designed pieces that are available at RISD Works in Providence.
Minakawa, a Rhode Island School of Design alumnus, spoke by phone from Bolivia, where he was working with Andean textile weavers and helping a nongovernmental organization devoted to bamboo products get on its feet.
"In 2000, I visited my sister in Japan for three weeks, and discovered how people could live with bamboo.
I realize now how "Important this is, because rather than simply being a chic or trendy object, it has been a cultural icon in Japan since time immemorial," Minakawa says.
"After thousands of years, the Japanese and other cultures continue to technologically refine and offer exciting artistic interpretations to the material."
Despite the increasingly wide range of uses for bamboo, flooring remains one of the most popular.
Trevor Gilmore, a partner in Bamboo Mountain, based in Novato, Calif., says his company uses formaldehyde free glue and Moso bamboo from China that's harvested every five to six years and can grow as tall as 100 feet.
Bamboo Mountain produces flooring in a light colored natural shade and a darker brown carbonized variety, both of which can be stained and finished.
The one caution Gilmore offers consumers is to do some homework to be sure you're getting a quality product with a long term warranty.
"We suggest everyone get one sample and take a look at the side view.
There shouldn't be any gaps," he says.
"If there are, that means the manufacturing and the glue are not up to par and there could be problems down the road with warping and buckling."
While several companies have taken a recent interest in bamboo, San Francisco's Smith and Fong has been selling bamboo home products for almost 20 years.
Like Bamboo Mountain, Smith and Fong's East Coast clientele is steadily growing, especially among those drawn to bamboo's environmental benefits, says company cofounder Daniel Smith.
"I went searching specifically for formaldehyde free materials," says Howard Goldkrand, a Smith and Fong customer and multimedia artist who divides his time between New York and Boston.
"The flooring has been in place less than two months.
It's great looking, it does all the things they say it does.
But more important, I'm happy with the environmental choices I'm making."
Smith started out selling bamboo tea boxes from the back of his 1972 orange Volkswagen.
Today, Smith and Fong makes bamboo flooring as well as cabinets and paneling.
The flooring is made out of laminated bamboo that the company calls Plyboo.
It's created by boiling bamboo strips in a solution of lime and boric acid, drying them in a kiln, and sanding the strips before laminating them into multi ply panels.
The flooring comes in two colors, natural (or untreated) bamboo and amber, which is steamed to a light brown shade.
Its wall paneling also comes in green and black tambour, made of naturally black bamboo.
"I think bamboo probably appeals to a whole variety of people," says Smith.
"People just looking for something new and different, people looking for something green and alternative who want to think they're contributing to a better world, people who relate to Asian design."
Incorrect preparation of raw cassava and fresh bamboo shoots can lead to exposure to naturally occurring hydrogen cyanide, Australia's food watchdog warned on Tuesday.
According to a new advice for the preparation of raw cassava and fresh bamboo shoots prior to consumption issued by Food Standards Australia New Zealand, there is the potential for cassava and bamboo shoots to cause harm if the food is not prepared properly.
"Our concern is that if someone purchases either raw cassava or bamboo shoots and does not know the correct preparation instructions there is a health risk," Acting General Manager for Food Standards (Australia) Paul Brent said in a statement.
"Cassava is safe to eat providing that the raw cassava is properly prepared by first peeling and slicing the cassava and then cooking it by baking, boiling or roasting," said the statement.
"The correct preparation of fresh bamboo shoots involves cutting the shoots in half lengthways, removing any outer leaves and fibrous tissue at the base, then thinly slicing the shoots into strips and boiling them for eight to 10 minutes in lightly salted water," it said.
Processed cassava, such as tapioca, cassava chips or cassava flour present little or no health risk as the processing removes the toxins.
Cassava is a tropical root crop similar to taro and yam.
Bamboo shoots are a traditional component of Asian cuisine.
Food Standards Australia New Zealand is a bi national independent statutory authority that develops food standards for composition, labeling and contaminants, including microbiological limits, that apply to all foods produced or imported for sale in Australia and New Zealand.
China's relentless appetite for the colonel's chicken has KFC on a building boom in the world's most populous country, with 1200 locations, soaring profits and a menu that mixes in bamboo shoots and lotus roots.
At a time when its sales in the United States are struggling, KFC is dominating even rival McDonald's in China and turning the goateed visage of Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Colonel Harland Sanders into a ubiquitous symbol of America.
"We are really positioned as a part of the fabric of life in China," said David Novak, chairman and chief executive of Louisville based Yum Brands Inc., parent company of KFC.
In China, KFC customers can dig into buckets of original recipe chicken, but some dishes are tailored for the Chinese palate.
There's a twister sandwich styled after the way Peking duck is served, but with fried chicken inside along with cucumber shreds.
Instead of cole slaw, which never caught on in China, customers can order seasonal vegetables.
In spring, it's bamboo shoots, in summer, lotus roots are on the menu.
And in colder months, there's rice porridge and winter soup.
KFC also offers a breakfast menu in China, a concept that the company doesn't envision introducing at its U.S. restaurants.
Yum's operating profits in China exceeded $200 million (euro153 million) in 2004 more than half the company's burgeoning international profits.
And the pace of 275 locations opened in the country last year is expected to be matched in 2005.
Sam Su, president of Yum's China division, called China "the ultimate marketplace."
He predicted that as the Chinese economy grows, it will someday surpass the number of KFC restaurants in the United States, where there are 5453 stand alone locations and 1277 multibrand outlets featuring other Yum brands.
"In many parts of China, the local municipal governments actually view the arrival of a KFC as a sign of the city coming of age," Su said in a phone interview from China.
A restaurant industry analyst said KFC's recipe for success in China includes a solid business plan guided by a management team intact for years.
"For many companies, China is a hope and a dream maybe a very realistic hope and a dream but for Yum it's reality today," said Joe Buckley with Bear Stearns & Co. "It's an important piece of the company that still has plenty of growth potential ahead of it."
Yum's China operations represented about 15 percent of the company's operating profits in 2004, a figure expected to reach about 18 percent this year, Buckley said.
Chinese fast food consumers have shown a preference for chicken, giving KFC a leg up.
"It's an advantage to be the chicken brand, given that scenario," Buckley said.
Other Yum brands also are vying for Chinese customers.
Yum opened at least 39 Pizza Hut restaurants in China last year, for a total of 146 outlets, and Su predicts a bright future for the chain.
"With the rising income and economic growth, there's no reason to doubt that Pizza Hut will be a huge brand," he said.
Taco Bell is testing a casual dining format in China, and Yum is even dabbling in Chinese fast food with one test restaurant in Shanghai.
But KFC is clearly at the forefront of Yum's expansion.
More than 100 KFC restaurants have sprung up in both Beijing and Shanghai.
The chain has spread to every Chinese province and region except Tibet.
KFC restaurants have reached 280 Chinese cities, compared to just 20 cities in 2000.
Yum's revenues in China topped $1 billion last year, up from $261 million in 1998.
Elsewhere around the globe, KFC opened about 50 new restaurants last year in the United Kingdom, another high growth market for Yum, raising its total chicken outlets to 660.
In the United States, KFC has struggled in a crowded fast food sector, including burger chains that have added chicken to their menus.
In China, KFC has outpaced rival McDonald's, which has its own expansion plans.
McDonald's has more than 600 restaurants in China and plans to open about 100 more this year, comparable to last year.
Its long range plans call for 1000 restaurants in China by 2008.
"We're very bullish on China," said spokesman Walt Riker.
"We're aggressively expanding the business."
Novak said Yum has a big head start over its competitors in China and intends to build on that advantage.
"We are truly walking the talk in terms of taking this market," he said.
A proposed mill that could turn a bamboo like plant to pulp might be an economic boon for this part of western Alabama, but it also could wreak ecological havoc.
Global Cellulose Systems, a British company, wants to build a $530 million production facility in Linden's industrial park that could employ as many as 500 workers.
The company also is seeking a commitment from area farmers to grow the bamboo like Arundo donax plant on as many as 30000 acres.
The crop could prove very profitable for producers, but the plant has been identified as a scourge in many areas.
"It's the worst invasive plant in much of the world," said Jim Miller, a research ecologist for the USDA Forest Service in Auburn.
"That's like the idea of planting kudzu, isn't it?"
John Woods, president of Athens, Tenn. based West Wing Technologies Inc., said the plant has been a problem in areas like Mexico and California, where it commonly grows in the wild, but not when grown in a controlled environment.
"It's never been a problem in plantations," he said, adding that the plant hasn't been grown on large tracts in the South before.
Woods' company specializes in growing and cloning bamboo and similar plants, and would assist regional farmers who choose to grow the crop.
Representatives from West Wing Technologies and Global Cellulose Systems plan to meet with area farmers this week to discuss plans for the mill and the plant.
Woods said it would take two years for the first crop to mature.
But the reed could be harvested every six months thereafter, with a likely production of 17 to 26 tons per acre.
That could mean several hundred dollars per acre for the farmers, he said.
Kevin Dixon, chairman of the Linden Area Industrial Development Board, said he doesn't think getting a commitment from farmers will be an issue.
"If you show them the money, I think they'll show you the land," he said.
Dixon said the industrial board heard of the company's desire to build a mill in the American South and contacted its officials.
The months long conversation has Global Cellulose Systems ready to come to Marengo County.
The pulp that would be manufactured from the crop is used for a variety of products, from shirts to flooring, and is sold mostly in Europe, Dixon said.
He said the location of the mill in Linden would have a big impact on the area.
"If this happens, offering 300 500 jobs in Linden, Alabama, I think it would change the economic outlook of the town forever," he said.
"It's going to help our whole county."
But what would it do to the environment?
Officials from the Nature Conservancy say that Arundo donax can rapidly invade stream banks and roadside habitats.
After it's established, the plant tends to suppress native vegetation and has invaded irrigation ditches, reducing their capacity.
Miller said it would be nearly impossible to keep the plants from getting into drainage systems and spreading to surrounding areas, despite what Woods said.
"If it's released in the landscape it will get in our streams," Miller said.
"It will grow along them and change our habitat."
The plant already exists in Alabama, but only in limited quantities.
It is native to the Mediterranean region, where it has been widely planted in Italy and other countries.
Like kudzu, Arundo donax was imported into the United States, originally for aesthetic reasons or for windbreaks on California ranches.
Miller, who recently led a conference on invasive plants including Arundo donax, said bringing it in large quantities to Alabama could be like the second coming of kudzu.
Warning that it would dry up streams and destroy wildlife habitat, he said policies are needed to prevent importing such invasive plants.
"The way is to develop industry and bar everything else," he said.
"That's the way of capitalism."
The region needs to do something, he said, "but it doesn't need this."
(The Tuscaloosa News in Tuscaloosa, Ala., is a member of the New York Times Regional Newspapers.)
Giant pandas in western China could be at risk of starvation because the bamboo plants that they eat are beginning to die off in a cycle that happens about every 60 years, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
Workers at the Baishuijiang State Nature Preserve in the northwestern province of Gansu plan to monitor the 102 pandas in the preserve for signs of hunger, Xinhua said in a report late Sunday.
Threatened pandas will be moved to areas that still have bamboo, with special attention given to older, feeble animals, it said, citing Zhang Kerong, the preserve's director.
Pandas derive most of their nutrition from arrow bamboo and can starve once the plant enters its dying off stage.
The stage begins when the bamboo forms flowers, after which the pandas refuse to eat it.
The bamboo then starts to produce seeds before dying.
Blooming happens about once every 60 years, with a new crop taking 10 years to mature.
However, the cycle seems to run along different schedules in different places and an earlier mass die off of bamboo in the 1980s caused the deaths of about 250 pandas, Xinhua said.
Xinhua said some bamboo has also started blooming in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, home to the rest of China's estimated 1590 wild pandas.
Flowering bamboo now covers more than 7000 hectares (17300 acres) of the 220000 hectare (544000 acre) preserve, Xinhua said.
It said 22 pandas living in the preserve's Bikou and Rangshuihe areas were directly threatened with starvation.
Zhang said rangers would patrol for ailing animals and rescue those in need.
Local villagers have also been told not to drive away or harm pandas if they enter inhabited areas looking for food.
China regards the panda as an unofficial national mascot, but the animal's limited diet is just one factor threatening its survival.
Panda numbers have declined as its habitat has fallen to farming and development, and the animal's low fertility rate causes it to reproduce at an agonizingly slow rate.
Chinese zoologists have improved the birth rate of giant pandas in captivity through artificial insemination.
The country has also launched a project to clone the animal as a way of boosting its numbers.
DESIGN WITH HISTORY IN MIND: Homeowners can experience a little bit of Americana every day with Karastan's new carpet collection inspired by historic landmarks.
The company has partnered with the National Trust for Historic Preservation to create a collection called Design in America The National Trust.
Karastan created 10 carpets featuring eight patterned designs and two coordinates.
To do so, the company's design team visited several properties under the watch of the National Trust.
The team then reinterpreted the architectural and color styles into newly updated tufted floor coverings.
The styles range from Gothic revival and turn of the century English manor to Georgian.
The inaugural designs for this collection were inspired by historic properties including Brucemore in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Drayton Hall in Charleston, S.C., Filoli and Oatlands in Woodside, Calif., Lyndhurst Castle in Tarrytown, N.Y., and Shadow on the Teche in New Iberia, La.
The National Trust is a nonprofit organization dedicated to saving historic places by raising funds and awareness of the need to preserve the sites.
The new designs will be available to the public in February, and a portion of proceeds generated will go to the National Trust.
For more information, call Karastan at (800) 234 1120, or visit www.karastan.com.

NONSLIP BAMBOO RUGS: Bamboo is one of the strongest and most versatile materials in the world.
From bamboo houses to floors and furniture, it has increasingly become popular in the world of home decor.
Anji Mountain Bamboo Rug Co. has contributed to this phenomenon with its high quality bamboo and newly introduced sisal and sea grass rugs.
The 2006 collection also features colored and silk screened bamboo rugs and features mixed rugs made with two types of material, providing for more flexibility in adding colors and patterns.
The bamboo rugs previously featured natural fiber backing, but the new nonslip backing allows for equal if not better resistance to water, mold and mildew, and costs about the same.
Due to the nonslip backing, a greater number of rugs can be used in indoor and outdoor areas such as entryways, foyers, dining rooms and patios.
They provide a beautiful accent to any room and floor.
The bamboo rugs are expertly kiln dried and carbonized to prevent cracking and warping.
The multiple layers of polyurethane coating also protect against scratching and staining.
And better yet, the rugs are environmentally friendly since they come from carefully controlled, renewable bamboo forests.
The rugs come in a wide variety of sizes and eye catching colors and patterns, and can be ordered in custom sizes.
The suggested retail price for the rugs ranges from $19.95 to $259.95.
They are available nationwide at stores such as Home Depot and Carpet One, and online at www.area rugs.org.

Forestry experts in northwest China's Gansu Province have identified in a recently concluded survey more than 20 insects that plague arrow bamboo, a major food for giant pandas.
An expert panel of the Gansu Provincial Science and Technology Department, headed by zoologist Wang Hongjian, spent the past three years studying insect pests in 478 square kilometers of bamboo forests about 79 percent of the total in Baishuijiang Nature Reserve, home to 102 giant pandas and at least 20 varieties of bamboos.
The experts collected more than 20000 specimens of bamboo eating insects, including various species of moths, aphids and bugs, studied their living habits and life cycles, and worked out efficient and pollution free pesticides that have proven an average effectiveness of 86.7 percent.
The survey was launched in 2002 in an effort to identify and curb the plague of insect pests and improve the quality of arrow bamboos to provide the best possible food resources for giant pandas.
In an interview with Xinhua Thursday, Wang said preservation of arrow bamboo is an important step in China's conservation of giant pandas.
"Insect plagues are just as harmful as flowering arrow bamboo, but the former issue has not received as much attention as it deserves in China," he said.
He said insect pests are deteriorating in recent years in Baishuijiang Nature Reserve, located in the southernmost part of Gansu Province and bordering Sichuan Province.
"In the worst affected areas, bamboos have withered and died."
According to a 1996 1998 forestry survey, nearly half of the reserve's 608 square kilometers of bamboo forests were plagued by insects, Wang said.
Pandas are among the world's most endangered wild animals.
According to statistics from the State Forestry Administration released in 2004, the number of pandas in the wild in China has risen by more than 40 percent from 1110 in the 1980s to 1590 today.
Meanwhile, another 161 giant pandas are kept in captivity at worldwide zoos.
Pandas mainly live in mountainous areas in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.
Giant pandas in the Baishui River Nature Reserve in northwest China's Gansu Province are facing a food shortage, as the arrow bamboo trees begin to bloom, making them unappetizing to pandas.
The acreage of blooming bamboo has reached 7410 hectares, or 12.2 percent of the nature reserve's total area, said Li Fuyi, an official with the nature reserve administration.
Li said, currently 102 pandas live in the nature reserve, 22 of which live in areas affected by blooming bamboo.
"More giant pandas might face shortage of food as the acreage of blooming bamboo is likely to expand in the coming years," Li said.
Arrow bamboo is the major food for giant pandas.
The bamboo plant blooms and then dies every 60 years, causing a severe loss of food for giant pandas.
New bamboo takes ten years to grow, and, during the gap, giant pandas face severe food shortages.
Blooming bamboo has been reported in the nature reserve three times since the 1970s, which has lead to the drop of the number of giant pandas in nature reserve from more than 300 to 96 in 1998.
Baishui River Nature Reserve Administration sent workers to trace those pandas affected by the blooming bamboo.
It is now ready to throw in food for these pandas to survive the threat.
A special clinic was also established to treat those pandas sick from starvation.
Pandas are among the world's most endangered wild animals.
According to statistics from the State Forestry Administration released in 2004, the number of pandas in the wild in China has risen by more than 40 percent from 1110 in the 1980s to 1590 nowadays.
A total of 161 pandas live in captive breeding programs worldwide.
Pandas mainly live in mountainous areas in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.
The Wolong Center in Sichuan, founded in 1963, is the largest panda reserve in China.
It has an area of 200000 hectares and is world renowned as the home for pandas.
Catalog and online retailer Viva Terra debuted last October, and although its products for home, garden and pantry are geared toward the environmentally conscious, there's nothing aesthetically compromised about them: chairs and bowls fashioned from recycled wine barrels, organic bedding and bathrobes, and bamboo extract towels made at a windmill powered factory on an island off the coast of Japan.
Think Marin County day spa not Berkeley commune and you'll get a good idea of how this Northern California based outfit has married sophisticated design with the Earth Day ethos.

To help Nigeria revitalize agriculture, the Chinese government has sent 393 experts in agriculture and related disciplines to provide assistance to farming communities across the West African country, a Nigerian official has said.
Salisu Ingawa, project coordinator of Nigeria's National Special Program for Food Security (NSPFS), told reporters at the weekend at a one day seminar for sensitization of stakeholders on bamboo development and utilization that the partnership between Nigeria and China in the area of agriculture was in keeping with the south south cooperation agreement between the two countries.
Within the frame work of the south south cooperation between Nigeria and that of China under the National Special Program for Food Security (NSPFS), he said, "there are 393 Chinese experts and technicians in agriculture and related disciplines working directly with farmers in farming communities in 109 NSPFS sites Nationwide."
According to Ingawa, the seminar tagged "Poverty Alleviation Through Bamboo based Development in Agriculture: China Experience" is necessitated by the need to borrow a leaf from China which earned as mush as 3.5 billion US dollars in foreign exchange from the bamboo based sector in 2003.
Early this year, he said, Michael Idowu, an agro forestry national facilitator, represented Nigeria to participate in an international workshop on poverty alleviation through bamboo based development in China.
He added that the volume of experience gathered through Nigeria 's participation has helped to stimulate the determination to explore Nigeria's vast bamboo reserve found mostly in the wild of southern and middle belt states of the country.
The NSPFS national project coordinator noted that Nigeria must reinvent its once enviable agricultural sector in a time when it is desirous of a viable alternative to oil revenue.
According to him, Nigeria is to set up a bamboo national database in order to effectively explore abundant bamboo resource which can boast of turning out about 300 byproducts.
Thailand's hospital in northern Nan province discharged 12 more botulism patients Tuesday, reducing the number of people still hospitalized with the rare and potentially fatal illness to 44, local media said.
Of those 44, seven remain in intensive care.
"All of the inpatients are recovering satisfactorily," said Public Health Ministry acting permanent secretary Prat Boonyawongvirot.
On March 14, 163 people were hospitalized with botulism after eating bamboo shoots contaminated with clostridium botulinum toxin at a meritmaking ceremony.
Clostridium botulinum is so dangerous and volatile it could potentially be used as a biological weapon.
Nan public health chief Pisit Sriprasert said academics from the Medical Sciences Department and the Disease Control Department had collected samples of the preserved bamboo shoots Monday to study how the clostridium botulinum had developed.
"Our research findings will help prevent another outbreak of this disease," he said.
At least one person was killed and seven injured when the trailer of a grain truck fell on top of them during a food stampede in this hunger ravaged southern African country.
The incident happened Friday at a government run food depot in Bangwe, a crowded township in the commercial capital, Blantyre, police spokesman Willy Mwaluka said.
Hungry people had been waiting there for days to buy subsidized maize meal from the Agriculture Development and Marketing Corp.
When the truck arrived from Mozambique, they rushed forward and were beaten back by guards wielding whips, said Mary Mdoka, who was among the crowd.
"We were pushed hard and some of us fell down," she said.
"It was sheer luck that not more that 20 people were killed when the trailer descended on us."
A guard said the depot's employees were trying to unhook the heavy trailer when it slipped, and they lost control of it.
He refused to be identified for fear of retribution.
The incident comes two weeks after guards fired guns to break up another food crush at a depot in the southern province of Nsanje, injuring two boys who remain hospitalized.
Up to 5 million people, almost half the population, are threatened with hunger in Malawi, reeling from years of drought and an AIDS epidemic that is destroying the agriculture work force.
Maize prices have skyrocketed, putting grain out of reach of many Malawians, 65 percent of whom survive on less than a dollar (euro) a day.
Most depend on subsidized grain, but the Agriculture Development and Marketing Corp. has also suffered shortages.
In some of the worst hit districts, people have resorted to eating water lily bulbs, bamboo seeds and termites.
A state in northeast India plans to set up a pioneering environmentally friendly power stations that run on bamboo to help meet the region's energy needs, officials said.
Assam state will be the first in India to use the "green" power and one of the first places in the world to tap the energy potential of the fast growing grass.
The state plans to set up two one megawatt capacity power plants that run on bamboo by February.
"This would be the first of its kind where we are using bamboo and bamboo wastes to generate electricity," Vinay S. Oberoi, director of the National Mission on Bamboo Applications, told AFP Thursday.
"This would not only be cost effective, but also highly eco friendly."
The government organization, which has centers in five northeastern states, funds research into commercial, industrial and other uses for bamboo, which grows widely in the area.
India, the world's largest producer of bamboo after China, grows about 80 million tons of the grass each year, more than half of it in the northeast.
The two power projects will cost an estimated total of 100 million rupees (2.2 million dollars), and were designed and developed by scientists at the Indian Institute of Science in the southern city of Bangalore, which has been working on turning bamboo into gas, and then electricity.
"We are confident the commercial success of gasification of bamboo for generation of electricity would help us to solve the energy crisis facing India and allow our experts to pursue such ventures on a bigger scale," Oberoi said.
The electricity produced by the bamboo based power plants, about 2000000 watts a year, will be used by local paper mills initially.
"Power from the two plants would be now used by two paper mills although such bamboo fuelled energy could be suitably used in off grid and remote locations, and to meet captive industry and utility needs," Oberoi said.
Experts from the Bangalore based scientific institute are working with the bamboo organization to develop a similar medium sized power plant for the Indian army in the northeast.
Oberoi said bamboo was also being used for pre fabricated quake shelters in Indian Kashmir.
A 7.6 magnitude earthquake in October killed more than 73000 people in Pakistan and 1300 in India, and left more than 3.5 million people homeless.
"We gave the idea to the Jammu and Kashmir government and now they are placing orders to at least four manufacturers of bamboo shelters," Oberoi said.
The National Zoo's giant panda cub, Tai Shan, didn't just happen he was brought to you by scientists who spent years studying the intimate details of black and white bear biology before they mastered artificial insemination.
A recent surge in giant panda science is helping zoos get more animals pregnant, diagnose when they are expecting and put to rest the long held belief that pandas are poor breeders.
The research is producing insights into how pandas communicate, how mothers raise their young and how the animals look for food.
The ultimate goal is to increase the giant panda's chances in the wilds of China, where only about 1600 remain, threatened mainly by the loss of bamboo forests to logging and development.
Scientists are studying the panda's basic survival needs and are trying to build up the number of captive animals so that some could be set loose in potential panda territory.
Money for the studies has come largely from the four U.S. zoos that have giant pandas including the National Zoo, where Tai Shan went on public display Thursday.
"I am not sure we know of any endangered species where we have this amount of information," said National Zoo senior scientist David Wildt.
In a recent interview, a high ranking Chinese wildlife official, Yan Xun, underscored the cooperation between U.S. and Chinese scientists: "We have achieved a lot of accomplishments," he said.
Tai Shan's birth in July was the result of years of research efforts.
Many experts believed that giant pandas were poor breeders because they seldom got pregnant in zoos and because females are fertile only two or three days a year.
But that idea crumbled after U.S. and Chinese scientists examined dozens of captive pandas in the late 1990s and found most biologically fit to breed.
"We have every reason to believe that pandas in the wild are doing all right as far as opportunities for pregnancy are concerned," said Donald Lindburg, head of the giant panda team at the San Diego Zoo, where three cubs have been born.
"This is more of a captive phenomenon."
Artificial insemination is one way around the obstacle of persuading pandas to breed naturally.
National Zoo scientists have been working since the 1980s on monitoring hormone changes to tell whether a female is fertile.
Scientists there and at other zoos ramped up the research in the late 1990s, when China began lending panda pairs to U.S. animal parks.
National Zoo keepers trained their female, Mei Xiang, to sit still for medical tests.
Scientists created a mobile lab to track hormone changes in her urine and improved testing to get results faster.
They watched for behavior changes that indicated she was ready.
"Short of crawling inside her abdomen," reproductive scientist JoGayle Howard said, "I don't think you can get any better timing."
Zoo scientists hoped that Mei Xiang and the male panda, Tian Tian, would mate naturally last spring, but when that did not happen, they stepped in as the female's short window of fertility was about to close.
Howard e mailed regular updates of Mei Xiang's test results to San Diego Zoo scientists, who suggested a specific time to perform artificial insemination.
With Mei Xiang under anesthesia the morning of March 11, Howard employed a tiny laparoscope with a light to perform the procedure, the first time that particular type of instrument was used on a giant panda.
"It's remarkable," Lindburg said.
"They had one vial, they had enough sperm for one insemination.
They had a single event, and they nailed it."
Zoo managers would prefer that pandas breed on their own, and one line of research is trying to foster that.
A major discovery is that pandas get to know each other through their noses.
A male panda can tell whether a female is in heat by sniffing her urine or the scent marks she leaves behind.
Each panda has an individual scent.
In the past, zoos raised males and females separately, putting them together only for mating.
Often, that resulted in fights, not cubs.
"When animals are introduced for breeding, they need time to become familiar with each other, scent wise, before they are put together," said Rebecca Snyder, curator of giant panda research at Zoo Atlanta.
So Chinese zoos often keep several young pandas together so they can get to know each other as they grow up.
The zoos also let breeding age animals sniff each other's scent before meeting.
Some scientists think this research suggests that if giant pandas were reintroduced in the wild, their chances would improve if their scent were spread around their new territory beforehand, staking their claim.
Scientists also have studied panda personality.
Former National Zoo researcher David Powell, now at the Bronx Zoo, developed an exam intended to give zoos rapid assessments of how to care for new animals.
He tested 38 pandas in China to measure their general activity, along with their level of interest in a new toy.
"That will tell you right away this animal adjusts well to change, or I have to be quiet around this animal," Powell said.
"We've made a lot of progress in behavior management and husbandry."
Long range, some zoo scientists think the personality test could help them improve panda breeding they could, for example, provide hiding places for a shy female that might be reluctant to mate.
Zoos still haven't solved the mystery of knowing when a giant panda is expecting.
It was not until Mei Xiang gave birth that the National Zoo knew for sure that she was pregnant.
Scientists would like a definitive pregnancy test so they can reduce stress on animals that might lead them to abandon their young, which weigh only a quarter pound at birth.
Hormone tests still cannot detect the difference between a real pregnancy and the common false pregnancy in pandas.
Ultrasound is promising, but some pandas won't sit still for it.
San Diego scientists are experimenting with a technique called thermal imaging, measuring whether a mother's blood flow is increasing, which is one sign of a developing embryo.
"We're still doing very basic work with the giant panda," said National Zoo research veterinarian Steve Monfort.
"We still have a long way to go."
Snyder, the Atlanta scientist, has looked at how mothers raise their young, finding that they hold their tiny infants 80 percent of the time during the crucial first three months.
Males and females are raised differently, she concluded.
And, so far, she has found little difference in mothering style between experienced and new mothers.
Other studies focus on how pandas look for food and what they like to eat.
Bamboo is their main diet, and they spend much of the day eating because bamboo has so little nutrition that they need a lot of it.
The Memphis Zoo is assembling a bamboo database of hundreds of samples and analyzing their nutritional value.
The zoo also tested a variety of bamboo on its two pandas, hoping to offer guidance to wildlife managers scouting for places in which to reintroduce pandas to the wild.
"They switch bamboo species through the year and switch the parts they eat sometimes leaves and sometimes stalks," said Matthew Thompson, the zoo's large mammal curator.
"In the spring, they like to eat shoots."
Most giant panda studies have been done on zoo animals, and the next frontier will be tracking the elusive animals in the wild.
Chinese officials have been reluctant to allow giant pandas to be fitted with radio collars that would make it easier to track them.
"A very big question for all of us is whether or not the information we've gleaned from watching animals in captivity echoes what is going on in the wild," San Diego's Lindburg said.
Giant panda research has had another payoff.
U.S. zoo scientists have trained dozens of their Chinese counterparts to test hormones, map panda territory on computers and learn other wildlife skills.
National Zoo reproductive scientist Howard hopes that cheetahs, maned wolves and other rare species could benefit from the artificial insemination device she developed for Mei Xiang.
Her colleague Monfort said zoos are developing hormone measurement tests for other types of animals, modeled on the giant panda work.
"We've got a lot of ideas now that we're ready to try on other species," Howard said.
A Chinese company has successfully produced fiber from maize and blended it with bamboo fiber to make environment friendly clothes.
The blended fiber is similar to Dacron, said Liu Jinhong, chairman of Suzhou Bangbo Company in east China's Jiangsu Province, while the clothes are soft and comfortable with an enhanced wrinkle resistance.
Maize is first made into starch, and then after a series of procedures spun into fiber.
U.S. scientists have succeeded in the production of fiber from maize more than a decade ago, and there are such factories in Taiwan.
The technology is not widely used due to its complexity and high cost.
Chinese researchers in Shanghai developed maize fiber last year using a new technology that reduces costs by 30 percent.
It still takes ten tons of maize to produce one ton of fiber.
The company plans to turn 4000 tons of maize into clothes this year, Liu said.
The department of science and technology of Jiangsu has drawn up a plan to promote the products.
The company said it succeeded in making fiber from bamboo in 2004 and the selling is well.

North Korea is refusing to show up for six party talks on its nuclear weapons programs in Beijing this week and the other nations have accepeted there will be a delay, a South Korean official said Monday.
The international community must be ready to help North Korea economically once the issue of the communist country's nuclear issue is settled, South Korean Deputy Prime Minister Han Duck soo said.
"Something must be done," Han told The Associated Press on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum finance minister's meeting that began Thursday on the South Korean island of Jeju.
He said such a need should be clear to the global community.
South Korea, the United States, Japan, China and Russia are trying to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons development in talks that may resume as early as next week in the Chinese capital of Beijing after going into recess last month.
The South Korean government has said it is ready to provide massive amounts of aid, including electricity, to the North if the rival country can reach an agreement on the nuclear program within the six party framework.
The talks have hit a snag over North Korea's insistence that it be allowed to possess nuclear power for what it describes as "peaceful means," a stance opposed by the United States.
Han, who is also South Korea's finance minister, also proposed expanding the scope of the APEC trade forum, first by inviting North Korea to participate as an observer in future finance ministers' meetings pending a resolution of the nuclear problem.
"On condition that there is progress at the ongoing six party talks, I think we should consider North Korea to be our first guest," he said in a speech to finance ministers.
Separately, in an interview with a South Korean newspaper Han also called on the 21 member APEC to help create a multinational rehabilitation fund for North Korea.
"I think finance ministers need to take the lead in establishing a rehabilitation program for North Korea on the condition that the six party talks end well," he told The Korea Times.
He added that South Korea was consulting with other countries to discuss establishing a Northeast Asian Development Bank provided agreement is reached with North Korea on the nuclear issue.
He told the AP, however, that there would be no formal discussions of the North Korean issue at the meeting.
The U.S. delegation is "not happy" with Han's proposal about the rehabilitation program, according to a U.S. Treasury official.
"It's just too premature," the official, who declined to be named, told Dow Jones Newswires.
A successful end to the nuclear talks should precede any such proposal, he said, adding that Japan shares a similar view.
The United States has generally taken a harder line on North Korea, saying the country's pursuit of nuclear weapons is an international menace and threat to neighboring countries such as Japan.
North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun has said the Stalinist country would return to the nuclear non proliferation treaty if a standoff over its nuclear weapons drive were resolved, state media said Sunday.
The offer came last week in Laos during a meeting of Asian foreign ministers, according to Radio Pyongyang, monitored by South Korea's Yonhap news agency.
Paek was quoted as saying North Korea would rejoin the treaty and open up to international inspectors "once the nuclear issue is resolved smoothly."
Similar remarks were made by North Korean leader Kim Jong Il last month during a meeting with a South Korean envoy.
North Korea withdrew from the treaty in 2003, three months after Washington accused Pyongyang of running a clandestine nuclear weapons program based on enriched uranium.
North Korea declared on February 10 it possessed nuclear weapons and said it needed them as a deterrent to what it said were US plans to launch a nuclear attack against it.
Six party talks about North Korea's nuclear arsenal have recessed after a 13 day session in Beijing.
That they lasted so long is encouraging: Three previous rounds ended after only three days.
But the road ahead with North Korea and with Iran, which has rejected a European proposal to curb its nuclear program in return for generous benefits looks bumpy at best.
The Korean negotiations bringing together the United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia are to resume near the end of this month.
But North Korea's attempt to put all the blame on Washington for the lack of substantive progress suggests that getting past basic differences may be impossible.
The Bush administration wants North Korea to dismantle its nuclear arsenal and other nuclear activities as a first step in a process that would include security, economic and diplomatic benefits for Pyongyang.
But North Korea insists on keeping a nuclear reactor for generation of electricity.
The Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty allows all member countries to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
But North Korea has withdrawn from the treaty and says it has built nuclear weapons because of Washington's "hostile policies" toward it.
Even if that hurdle could be overcome, Pyongyang's secret nuclear activities that came to light only in 2002 are a damning indictment.
At a minimum, North Korea would have to accept a comprehensive United Nations inspection program for any agreement to have credibility.
Iran's situation is slightly different.
Tehran remains a party to the nonproliferation treaty, but it has admitted keeping secret for 17 years a program that also was revealed only recently.
Now it insists on exercising its right under the treaty to develop nuclear energy.
This week, after rejecting a European Union compromise plan, it unilaterally ended an agreement it made last fall with the EU to suspend nuclear activities by resuming conversion of uranium into a gas, an early phase in a process that could lead either to civilian energy generation or production of nuclear weapons.
President Bush, who once called both Iran and North Korea part of an "axis of evil," has now become conciliatory toward Tehran, which despite its rejection of the EU plan says it wants to continue negotiations.
It's also doubtful that taking Iran's case to the U.N. Security Council, as both U.S. and European officials have said they might do, would result in sanctions.
Both China and Russia have strong reservations about sanctions, in part because of lucrative energy deals with Tehran.
At the moment, the U.S. approach is the right one.
It's important that the United States and its European allies maintain a united front, neither closing the door to potential solutions nor yielding on fundamental principles aimed at preventing the breakdown of nuclear arms control.
The United States and North Korea Monday held another bilateral meeting, their seventh in a week, as they continue to work together to find a solution to the nuclear standoff, sources said.
Their meeting was one of several that took place Monday morning between the six nations taking part in negotiations to convince the Stalinist state to abandon its atomic weapons programs.
"There was a bilateral meeting between South Korea and the US, and then China met North Korea and South Korea, and then North Korea and the US met," said a source close to the negotiations who did not want to be identified.
It was not clear how long the meetings lasted.
The United States and North Korea have met seven times in the past week amid wider international talks on Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program.
North Korea on Monday proposed resuming six nation talks on its nuclear program during the week of September 12, a foreign ministry spokesman was quoted by the North's official KCNA news agency as saying.
Talks aimed at persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programs will resume on September 13, China said Thursday.

Sept 8: China announces that the six party talks will resume on September 13.
South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki Moon said Wednesday six nation nuclear disarmament talks on North Korea, due to reopen in Beijing next week, would be open ended.
"With no ending date fixed in advance, the talks will continue as long as there are chances for making any progress," Ban told a weekly briefing.
He said his government would "do its utmost to help make substantive progress" at the new talks for which host China will "soon" fix an opening date.
North Korea reportedly prefers September 13.
The comments came as the United States and North Korea, the two major players, were still at loggerheads over Pyongyang's demand for the right to peaceful nuclear activities, rejected by Washington.
"(North Korea) had built the nuclear power facilities for decades tightening its belts," Rodong Sinmun, the North's communist party newspaper, said in a commentary on Tuesday.
"It is unimaginable for (North Korea) to dismantle its independent nuclear power industry built with so much effort, yielding to outsiders' pressure, without getting any proposal for compensating for the loss of nuclear energy."
The fourth round of talks, which involve the two Koreas, the United States, China, Russia and Japan, broke off on August 7 for a three week recess and were originally due to resume in the final week of August.
But the Stalinist North delayed the talks for another two weeks, announcing they would resume sometime in the week beginning September 12.
It cited annual South Korea US war games for the delay.
The nuclear standoff began in October 2002 when the United States accused North Korea of a secret uranium enrichment program in violation of a 1994 arms control pact.
Pyongyang has denied the US charges but declared in February this year that it had already built nuclear bombs.
Since 2003, the six nation talks have aimed to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons in exchange for diplomatic and economic benefits as well as security guarantees.
Australia welcomed North Korea's decision to give up its nuclear weapons programs but warned that implementing Pyongyang's commitment would take work, a spokesman for Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Monday.
"It's an encouraging step forward but there's work to be done in terms of implementing it," the spokesman told AFP.
Australia stood ready to help North Korea in terms of energy assistance, development aid and compliance expertise, he added.
In the agreement reached Monday, North Korea pledged to give up its nuclear weapons in exchange for promises of aid and security.
Other nations agreed to "recognise" the North's demand for nuclear energy and said Pyongyang's request to have a light water nuclear reactor for peaceful purposes would be revisited "at an appropriate time".
North Korea on Tuesday strongly disputed allegations it has a uranium enrichment program, describing the claim as a U.S. "sheer fabrication" The denial, in a commentary by North Korea's main Rodong Sinmun newspaper, came hours before six nation nuclear disarmament talks resumed in Beijing, after a month's hiatus, to try to get the North to abandon its nuclear programs.
The nuclear row began in 2002 following U.S. allegations that the North was secretly running a uranium enrichment program in violation of its earlier promise not to pursue atomic weapons.
"We state clearly that we don't have any kind of uranium enrichment program at all," said Tuesday's commentary, which was carried by the North's Korean Central News Agency.
"The U.S. talk about the DPRK's uranium enrichment program is no more than a sheer fabrication."
DPRK is a short for North Korea's official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North also harshly criticized Washington for trying to give the impression that the communist country is to blame for the delay in resolving the nuclear problem.
The North, however, reiterated that denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula remains a "consistent policy and ultimate goal" of the country.
The six party talks involve the two Koreas, the United States, Japan, China and Russia.
Six party talks aimed at persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programs resumed in Beijing Tuesday after a five week break, Japanese officials said.

Sept 13: Talks resume with North Korea repeating its demand to be allowed nuclear programs for peaceful purposes, including a light water reactor.
The US rejects this.
Sept 19: Talks end with the signing of a joint statement.
In the document, North Korea agrees to abandon its nuclear weapons programs and return to the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty in return for recognition of its right to nuclear energy.
It also agrees to allow international inspectors to return while the United States pledges to gradually normalize relations with the reclusive regime.
No timetable is given.
Highlights of agreement issued Monday by six nations participating in North Korean nuclear talks: North Korea to give up nuclear weapons and nuclear programs, return at an early date to Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and submit to International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.
U.S. declares it has no nuclear arms on the Korean Peninsula, no intention to attack North Korea.
South Korea reaffirms it won't deploy nuclear weapons, affirms it has none in its territory.
China, Russia, South Korea, the U.S. and Japan agree to discuss "at an appropriate time" giving North Korea a light water nuclear reactor a type less easily diverted for weapons use.
North Korea, U.S. pledge to respect each other's sovereignty, coexist peacefully, work to normalize relations.
North Korea, Japan agree to work to normalize ties.
China, Russia, South Korea, Japan and the U.S. to give North Korea energy assistance, including electric power from South Korea.
Russia's atomic chief said his country was ready to build a nuclear power station for North Korea after the communist regime's breakthrough pledge Monday to abandon its nuclear weapons program, the ITAR Tass news agency reported.
Federal Atomic Energy Agency chief Alexander Rumyantsev said the offer was in line with the agreement reached in Beijing, under which the other parties in the talks the United States, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea pledged energy assistance to impoverished North Korea.
Rumyantsev said such assistance could involve construction of a nuclear power station in North Korea.
"We do build nuclear power stations abroad, we could do the same in North Korea," Rumyantsev was quoted by ITAR Tass as saying.
"Everyone knows about the energy shortage in North Korea, therefore we must act quickly."
South Korea has offered to send electricity to North Korea across the heavily armed border dividing the peninsula.
Rumyantsev didn't rule out revival of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, a consortium set up in 1995 to build two light water nuclear power plants for North Korea as part of a deal to shut down its weapons program.
The US$4.6 billion (euro3.8 billion) KEDO construction project that involved the United States, South Korea and Japan has been on hold since 2003, after the United States confronted North Korea with evidence it had sought to secretly develop nuclear weapons by enriching uranium.
Russia, which is eager to earn on its substantial expertise in the nuclear industry, has pursued a US$800 million (euro658 million) project to build Iran its first nuclear reactor, despite U.S objections.
The United States and North Korea have failed to narrow their differences in their latest one on one meeting Thursday, a South Korean official said as nuclear disarmament talks spluttered on.
US envoy Christopher Hill held a 90 minute meeting with North Korean counterpart Kim Gye gwan, but the talks led nowhere.
"I understand North Korea and the United States did not narrow their differences," said a South Korean official.
"On their way out of the meeting, they had stiff faces."
It was the second bilateral meeting between the two men since six nation talks aimed at persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programs resumed on Tuesday.
They also had an informal dinner meeting.
The two sides are deadlocked over North Korea's demand to be allowed nuclear programs for peaceful purposes, which Washington rejects.
North Korea said Tuesday that it would not dismantle its nuclear weapons programme until it is provided with a light water reactor for generating electricity, one day after agreeing to disarm in return for pledges of aid and security.
North Korea vowed Tuesday it would not give up its right to pursue nuclear programs for peaceful purposes as its chief delegate left Pyongyang for six party nuclear disarmament talks in Beijing.
US President George W. Bush said Friday that he and visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin shared the aim of keeping nuclear weapons from Iran and North Korea.
Commissioner Bud Selig and Major League Baseball have taken a lot of heat over the last several months for their supposed failure to grapple forthrightly with the sport's steroid problem.
Some have even suggested that people in the commissioner's office have been winking at one another while they make public pronouncements against steroid use.
From my perspective, these critics are jumping to unfair conclusions.
They would benefit from taking a step back and looking more carefully at the evolution of the steroid problem in baseball.
Before the mid 1990s, the substances of choice in the clubhouse were amphetamines and recreational drugs.
The prevailing view was that top offensive performances in baseball demanded quick reflexes, good eye hand coordination, quick feet, flexibility and strong wrists not bulky muscles.
An FBI special agent, Greg Stejskal, told the news media last month that he had notified Major League Baseball about 10 years ago that steroid use was a developing problem.
Indeed, it was probably around 10 years ago that some people in baseball became aware that anabolic steroids were being used by some players.
At the time, many anabolic steroids were illegal if purchased without a prescription.
But as baseball became more aware of this as a growing issue, the commissioner's office did, in fact, act.
In 1998, Selig convened a group at his Milwaukee office, including team physicians, trainers and outside medical experts, and they decided to begin an investigation and to gather as much information about steroid use and its effects as possible.
The next year, together with the players union, baseball helped finance a study on androstenedione.
It turned out to be the seminal study on the substance and was later published in a leading medical journal.
In June 2001, Major League Baseball published a pamphlet in English and in Spanish and distributed it to major league and minor league players.
It laid out in considerable detail the known effects of various classes of performance enhancing drugs.
It also hired a new medical staff to advise it on drug policy.
Baseball reasoned that if it could get players to the majors clean, then it had won half the battle.
In the same year, it decided to put in a stringent testing and penalty program for the minor leagues.
Incidentally, it wasn't until May 2002 that Ken Caminiti, in an interview with Sports Illustrated, estimated that half of major leaguers were using steroids.
In 2002, baseball and the union agreed to their first steroid testing and penalty program.
Earlier this year it was agreed in the middle of a collective bargaining agreement to extend that program significantly.
It would be easy to go back and identify instances when baseball might have gotten the message sooner.
It would be equally easy to argue that baseball might have acted sooner or more punitively.
It is a safe bet that today Selig and others wish they had done more earlier.
Indeed, the new testing and penalty protocol is far from perfect.
But it is also proper to remember that baseball was hampered by the confidentiality of doctor patient relationships, the sanctity of the clubhouse culture and union concerns about privacy rights.
The dimensions and the implications of the drug issue in professional sports are just beginning to be understood.
One must understand the scope of the problem before one can devise effective policy.
Eradicating drug abuse is no simple matter.
New chemical compounds and new delivery methods (making detection much more difficult) are being developed every day.
Underscoring the intractability of the problem is the fact that most athletes under investigation in the BALCO scandal are Olympians, and that the International Olympic Committee is reputed to have the gold standard in anti doping policies.
Down the road, gene modification therapy will further complicate the landscape.
Major League Baseball must be patient and tenacious if it is to have success in the long run fight against performance enhancing drugs.
Fans, too, need patience.
US lawmakers ripped into Major League Baseball's new drug testing plan, describing it as shamefully inadequate on the eve of a Congressional hearing into rampant steroid taking by stars.
The option of imposing fines rather than mandatory bans for steroid offenses raised questions about the quality of MLB's anti doping plan as well as the trustworthiness of leaders to police the game.
Revealing weak points of the plan, US House of Representatives Government Reform Committee chairman Tom Davis and ranking minority member Henry Waxman sent an open letter to baseball commissioner Bud Selig and union boss Don Fehr.
"Our preliminary review raises questions about whether the new policy is as comprehensive and effective as ,claimed," Davis and Waxman wrote, pointing up numerous weaknesses compared with World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) standards.
"We have a number of questions about the discrepancies between Major League Baseball's public presentation of its new drug testing effort and the language of the new policy.
We hope you will come prepared to address these questions."
Major League Baseball, which presented its plan to lawmakers Monday in advance of the hearings, began steroid testing last season and unveiled a toughened plan January 13 that Selig said "will eradicate steroid use."
Despite tough talk, baseball's policy shows possible fines with no bans for any steroid offender.
First offences were stated as punishable by "a 10 day suspension or up to a 10000 dollar fine" with second offences a 30 day ban or 25000 dollar fine, then 60 day ban or 50000 dollar fine, one year ban or 100000 dollar fine.
"One hundred thousand dollars is less money than some players earn in one game," Davis and Waxman noted.
The penalty for a fifth violation is at the commissioner's discretion.
US Senator John McCain ripped Selig and Fehr in a letter for misrepresenting the standards of baseball's anti doping plan and hinted that lawmakers were ready to take action if baseball leaders would not impose mandatory bans.
"I can reach no conclusion but that the league and the players' union have misrepresented to me and to the American public the substance of MLB's new steroid policy," McCain wrote.
"I expect the league and the players' union to modify the new policy.
To do anything less than that would constitute a violation of the public's trust, a blow to the integrity of Major League Baseball and an invitation to further scrutiny of the league's steroid policy."
Steroid offenders who are fined rather than suspended are not identified under baseball's plan and even those suspended have no mandatory public confirmation the ban was for steroids, results being "strictly confidential".
Compare that to the two year public ban for steroid first offenders in Olympic sports and lifetime ban thereafter under WADA rules and it's easy to see why baseball's plan was eyed with scorn and skepticism.
"Despite the public assurances of Major League Baseball officials, we have questions about the effectiveness of its new drug policy," Davis and Waxman wrote.
"There appear to be major differences between Major League Baseball's new policy and the independent, widely respected testing program of the Olympics.
"The Olympic policy appears comprehensive, strict, independent, and transparent.
Major League Baseball's program appears to raise questions on all four counts."
The baseball policy excludes four anabolic steroids boldione, danazol, quinbolone and dihydroepiandrostone that are banned for Olympians.
"Designer" steroids covered under Olympic doping guidelines are not under baseball's plan.
"The failure of Major League Baseball to cover designer steroids would appear to be a significant omission," Davis and Waxman wrote.
"According to experts, hundreds of potential "designer" steroids already exist.
Major League Baseball is still confronting a major scandal cgation is launched into drug testing and the league and union "have successfully resisted an investigation at the trial court level" with the entire program subject to renegotiation if suspended beyond a year.
"This provision appears designed to discourage responsible independent oversight," Davis and Waxman wrote.
In a joint statement, Major League Baseball confirmed only that the draft given Monday to lawmakers was indeed the plan being used since March 3.
"We expect player ratification within days," Fehr said.
Baseball star slugger Barry Bonds told a grand jury that he used a clear substance and cream from a firm embroiled in a doping scandal, but he never thought they were steroids, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Thursday.
On its website, the newspaper cited a transcript of Bonds' testimony to support a claim that would forever taint the 40 year old Major League Baseball star's historic home run feats.
Bonds hit a single season record 73 home runs in 2001 and has a career total of 703 homers 53 shy of breaking Hank Aaron's all time American homer record.
The report said that Bonds, testifying on December 4 of last year, told a federal grand jury investigating the BALCO steroid scandal that he received and used "clear" and cream substances obtained from personal trainer Greg Anderson.
Anderson, BALCO founder Victor Conte, BALCO executive James Valente and athletics coach Remy Korchemny are all charged with steroid distribution.
All have pleaded not guilty.
A trial is expected to start in March.
Bonds testified that he thought the substances, believed to be the previously undetectable steroid THG, were a rubbing balm for arthritis and nutritional supplement flaxseed oil.
Democratic lawmaker Henry Waxman of California asked Thursday that former baseball star Jose Canseco appear at congressional hearings to talk about the steroid scandal.
Waxman would also like to call Canseco's former teammate Mark McGwire and force them to testify under oath about the culture of performance enhancing drugs in Major League Baseball (MLB).
"Jose Canseco's allegations about steroid use by Mark McGwire and other baseball players have received enormous media attention.
Many of the individuals have denied the accusations.
Mr Canseco insists his information is accurate," Waxman said.
"There is a simple way to find the truth in this matter.
Our committee should hold a hearing with Mr Canseco, Mr McGwire and others and have them testify under oath.
"This would be an opportunity to find out what really happened and to get to the bottom of this growing scandal."
In his controversial new book, "Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits and How Baseball Got Big," Canseco said he injected steroids into some of the baseball's biggest stars, including home run legend McGwire and New York Yankees superstar Jason Giambi.
The players have vehemently denied ever using performance enhancing steroids.
In a letter to Tom Davis, chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, Waxman said he also wants MLB officials to explain what measures they are taking to deal with the steroids.
"We should also hear from representatives from Major League Baseball and the players' union to examine what they plan to do to stop the use of dangerous drugs by pro baseball players.
"Despite the baseball commissioner's statement that his goal is to have zero tolerance regarding steroids, Major League Baseball has announced it will not investigate Mr Canseco's allegations."
Baseball has been trying in the last few months to toughen its penalties for steroid use but critics say the new laws lag behind other sports.
A first positive test would now result in a suspension of up to 10 days, a second positive test a 30 day ban, a third positive a 60 day penalty.
Under the previous agreement, a first positive test resulted only in treatment.
In the Olympics the first penalty is a two year ban.
Waxman said the steroid issue not only threatens the health of professional players but also youths who feel the only way to be successful in the sport is to take steroids.
Steroid tainted baseball stars Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi and Jose Canseco were among 11 people issued subpoenas here Wednesday to testify next week before a US Congress hearing on steroids.
Curt Schilling, Frank Thomas and Rafael Palmeiro also were ordered to speak March 17 to a House of Representatives Government Reform Committee hearing in a session that could blow the lid off Major League Baseball's steroid scandal.
Barry Bonds, the superstar most nagged by steroid accusations, was not given the chance to clear his name as he was not invited or subpoenaed.
Bonds said last week he would testify if his attorney thought it was a good idea.
"If you bring Bonds up, he's going to be the whole show at this point," committee chairman Tom Davis told ESPN, saying he hoped to avoid a "witch hunt".
Players would be under oath and risk perjury if lying in testimony, so they face a hot seat if asked whether or not they took steroids.
They could say yes or no or refuse to answer for self incrimination, a practical guilt admission.
"It should be about lifting baseball up out of this cloud no witch hunts, no intention to force somebody into a position where they will be prosecuted," committee member Dennis Kucinich told ESPN.
"The hearings have to be conducted in a way that is not prosecutory.
It should not be a witch hunt.
It should not be about poutting people in jail.
It should be about looking at the issue, raising the discussion.
San Francisco Giants star Bonds admitted taking products that have been identified by prosecutors as steroids as part of the BALCO doping scandal.
Bonds' personal trainer, Greg Anderson, is among four men charged in a steroid distribution ring in the BALCO case.
All have pleaded innocent.
Bonds owns the major league one season home run record and could eclipse Hank Aaron's career homer record in 2006, but Bonds' BALCO link and baseball's lack of steroid testing for key years in his career have clouded the feat.
"This is not about one individual," Kucinich said.
"We need to look at the overall effect."
Lawmakers have stressed sending a message to American youth about the harmful nature of taking steroids, something US President George W. Bush mentioned 14 months ago in a State of the Union speech.
Also issued subpoenas were Robert Manfred, Major League Baseball executive vice president, players union executive director Don Fehr, San Diego Padres general manager Kevin Towers and former Oakland general manager Sandy Alderson, now Major League Baseball's vice president of baseball operations.
Several players had said they would not attend the hearing.
Now they must do so or face contempt citations.
"Jose Canseco, Donald Fehr and Rob Manfred have already told the committee they will testify," Davis said.
"The remaining witnesses, however, made it clear either by flatly rejecting the invitation to testify or by ignoring our repeated attempts to contact them they had no intention of appearing before the committee.
"They have left the committee no alternative but to issue subpoenas."
Manfred objected to the subpoenas, saying, "It is singularly inapporiate to subpoena certain players" because it would tarnish their reputations.
"We have made an offer (to make witnesses available) that should be sufficient to answer any questions about what has gone on with regard to Major League Baseball and steroids."
Manfred said.
Canseco's new book "Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits and How Baseball Got Big" named several top stars as steroid users, including retired St. Louis star McGwire, New York Yankees star Giambi and Palmeiro, a Baltimore teammate of Dominican standout Sosa.
Sosa and McGwire were involved in an epic homer race in 1998 where both surpassed the old homer record, one that helped revive interest in the sport.
"It's important the American people know the facts on baseball's steroid scandal and it's important all Americans, especially children, know about the dangers of drug use," Davis said.
"Consistent with our jurisdiction over the nation's drug policy, we need to better understand the steps MLB is taking to get a handle on the steroid issue and whether news of those steps and the danger posed by steroid use, is reaching America's youth."
Baseball executives and union leaders have agreed to toughen penalties for this season after imposing the first steroid tests last season.
An off season testing program has been started.
But a 10 day ban for first time offenders, 30 days for second offenses and 60 days for third time cheaters is still far shy of two year bans for Olympic sports a tougher level of testing that does not govern US sports leagues.
Former Major League Baseball all star Ken Caminiti, who admitted taking steroids to boost his playing career, died of a heart attack on Sunday.
He was 41.
The ex MVP of the National League in 1996 and gold glove winner was selected to the all star team three times.
But he struggled to find his place in society once his Major League Baseball playing days ended three years ago.
He blasted 239 homers and 983 RBI and was a .272 career hitter.
His best season came in 1996, when he hit 40 home runs and 130 RBI for the San Diego Padres.
The much travelled Caminiti played for Atlanta, Houston, San Diego and Texas.
Caminiti become the first American baseball player to publicly admit using steroids in 2002.
"It's no secret what's going on in baseball," said Caminiti, who retired in 2001 after 15 years in the major leagues.
"At least half the guys are using (steroids).
They talk about it.
They joke about it with each other."
Caminiti said he used steroids for about eight years after injuring his shoulder as a member of the San Diego Padres.
"I got really strong, really quick.
I pulled a lot of muscles.
I broke down a lot," he said.
Caminiti's best season was 1996 when, at age 33, he hit 40 homers had 130 runs batted in and a .326 batting average.
He said the steroid use was catching up to him.
"My tendons and ligaments got all torn up.
My muscles got too strong for my tendons and ligaments.
"And now my body's not producing testosterone.
You know what that's like?
You get lethargic.
You get depressed.
It's terrible."
Caminiti is the latest athlete to die at a young age after admitting to using performance enhancing drugs.
Baseball implemented recent changes to its drug testing policies which critics have called too lax.
Caminiti is just the latest professional athlete to die after admitting steroid use.
Former National Football League star Lyle Alzado attributed excessive steroid use to the brain cancer that killed him.
Alzado, who played from 1971 85, died at 43 on May 14, 1992.
He, who played for Los Angeles, Denver and Cleveland, insisted that almost 20 years of steroid use was the major contributing factor.
US lawmakers passed legislation allowing tighter government regulation of steroid precursors here Monday, one day after the death of former baseball star Ken Caminiti, an admitted steroid user.
The Anabolic Steroid Control Act would add androstenedione, norandrosterone and similar testosterone production enhancing substances to a list of anabolic steroids regarded as controlled substances.
The legislation allows the US Drug Enforcement Agency to regulate these products as anabolic steroids under the Controlled Substances Act. Mark McGwire admitted taking andro during a record breaking 70 home run season in 1998, back when the substance was not banned by the US baseball league, which only began steroid testing of players this season.
"This important legislation will help us reach our goal of zero tolerance in the battle against steroids," major league commissioner Bud Selig said.
"This will allow us to test for steroid precursors, just as we are currently testing for steroids, as part of our regular testing."
A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act, toughening penalties for anabolic steroid offenses near sports facilities, was put forth on March 1 and passed by the US House of Representatives in June.
Caminiti, who played in the major leagues for 15 years, died of an apparent heart attack Sunday at age 41.
He had admitted to using steroids during his Most Valuable Player season in 1996, when he hit .326 with 40 homers and 130 runs batted in for the San Diego Padres.
As with athletics, baseball has been criticized since the BALCO Labs steroid scandal broke a year ago.
BALCO founder Victor Conte and vice president James Valente, athletics coach Remi Korchemny and Greg Anderson, the personal trainer for baseball star Barry Bonds, have all pleaded not guilty to steroid distribution charges in the case.
Grand jury testimony saw many top sports figures testify, including San Francisco star Bonds and Gary Sheffield and Jason Giambi of the New York Yankees.
Drug testing was a key part of the labor deal baseball club owners signed with players in 2002.
After between five and seven percent of players tested positive in anonymous testing last year, a tougher testing programme was installed, although global sports officials have called relatively light penalties by Olympic standards laughable.
Steroid controversy swirled around Major League Baseball here Monday as a new book with doping accusations hit the stands and players began pre season training in Florida.
Former major league slugger Jose Canseco's new book "Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits and How Baseball Got Big" includes claims he injected steroids into several of baseball's biggest, literally, stars.
"I don't want to talk about Canseco's book," Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig said Monday.
"I'm not going to comment on a book I haven't read or seen."
Canseco claimed to inject steroids into former one season home run record setter Mark McGwire, New York Yankees star Jason Giambi plus Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez and Juan Gonzalez when they were teammates in Texas and Oakland.
All have denied any wrongdoing but the stigma of the accusation in the wake of the BALCO steroid scandal revelations and the lack of steroid testing prior to 2004 in the major leagues has cast suspicion over numerous 1990s stars.
"I don't think it was the right thing to do," Yankees star Tino Martinez said of the book.
"The guys who were named will have to answer questions every day of spring training and will always have that allegation hanging over them."
Canseco admitted using steroids himself throughout a 16 year career in which they were not banned by Major League Baseball.
The 30 team league only began a ban last year.
Weak penalties were toughened for the upcoming season but remain far below the two year ban imposed under World Anti Doping Agency rules.
Selig was irate at the notion that major league owners and players profited from blind eyes to steroid takers because they boosted crowds and helped erase long term labor woes that included wiping out the 1994 World Series.
"I've heard people say over and over that the owners liked it and the players liked it and it brought money in," Selig said.
"It's so without merit that you wonder how people can even talk about it."
Adding to the steroid chaos was a report on Fox News Channel that Barry Bonds, who has admitted taking BALCO products but said he was unaware they were steroids, knowingly used steroids and was fearful of being discovered.
That report came from Kimberly Bell, who says she was Bonds' mistress for nine years and that he admitted using steroids in 1999 and 2000.
Bell has said she intends to write a book on the subject.
Bonds' lawyer admits the ballplayer had a relationship with Bell but said the steroid claims are to promote the book and come after failed attempts to collect money from Bonds.
Bonds, 38, is approaching the all time home run record of 755 by Hank Aaron.
But a major sponsor pulled out promotional plans in the wake of steroid revelations about Bonds.
Selig said if Bonds becomes the all time homer king, his mark would be hailed as any other despite the shadow of doping looming over recent acheivements.
"Breaking records will be celebrated like all records will be celebrated," Selig said.
"I'm not going to comment on anecdotal evidence or no evidence at all."
The problem is that there is no evidence because of the lack of a testing program.
Being clean now that tests are ongoing is no sign of purity in past years and the reduced size of several past top hitters nags at skeptics.
As Sandy Alderson, Major League Baseball's vice president of baseball operations, told ESPN, there is likely no way McGwire can distance himself from Canseco's claims despite his repeated denials of taking performance enhancers.
"There's really not the proof out there to make this possible," Alderson said Monday, noting that more and more fans are unhappy.
"There's a great deal of suspicion on the part of fans," he said.
"What I think the fans are most interested in is fixing the problem rather than what has happened in the past."
Alderson, general manager of the Oakland A's during the era when Canseco was powering them into the playoffs. supported the idea that Canseco was seeking attention for his book and other moneymaking projects.
"I think there's something to that," Alderson said, adding that "it doesn't seem he's making any effort to make any progress" in combating steroids in baseball.
Asked if general managers should question the players mentioned in the book, Alderson said, "Is it up to a general manager to ask if a player is cheating on his wife?"
Tony La Russa, manager of the A's during Canseco's era and now manager of the reigning National League champion St. Louis Cardinals, predicted a bad fate for Canseco.
"He'll be a pariah in baseball," La Russa said.
Also Monday, USA Today reported that the Yankees admitted removing the word "steroid" from Giambi's contract during 2001 talks, saying they felt they were protected on the issue by broader language elsewhere in the deal that banned "illegal drugs" or "chemical use and dependency."
Giambi is set to play for the Yankees as part of his seven year contract worth 120 million dollars but faces the new accusation as he prepares for a new season.
"You can't control what people are going to write and say," Yankees star Derek Jeter said of Giambi's situation.
"You just take care of what you can control."
Responding to criticism that Major League Baseball has not done enough to deter steroid use among players, Commissioner Bud Selig said in a telephone interview Friday that the testing program put in place two years ago showed a significant drop in positive tests in 2004.
Selig said 1 to 2 percent of players in the major league program tested positive last year, down from 5 to 7 percent in 2003.
If about 1200 players were tested in 2004, then 12 to 24 tested positive.
"This year I believe we will clean that up," he said.
And in the minor league steroid testing program, which began in 2001, Selig said positive results had gone from 11 percent in 2001 to 4.8 percent in 2002 to 4.0 percent in 2003 to 1.7 percent last year.
Selig said the results refuted "the thought that this is running wild."
Selig was reacting to concerns that baseball's steroid testing program was not tough enough.
A House committee has announced it will investigate steroid use in baseball, and Selig has been invited to testify along with a number of present and former players, among them Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire.
At a news conference in Mesa, Ariz., on Saturday, Selig would not say whether he would appear before the committee.
Rob Manfred, baseball's chief labor relations executive, said he was also encouraged by the 2004 major league results.
"One person from our perspective is too much," he said in a telephone interview.
"However, I think the 1 to 2 percent shows that the steps we have taken have allowed the game to make progress."
The tests were conducted under an agreement between the players and management in 2002.
That program was criticized as too lenient.
Even the penalties under baseball's latest plan are light compared with those of other sports.
A first time offender draws a 10 day suspension.
In international track and field, a first time offender is out for two years.
"I often hear it's a weak program," Selig said.
"The average player would lose $140000 if he is suspended for 10 days.
Another huge deterrent is naming people."
Selig defended baseball's record in trying to clear up the steroid problem, saying he had devoted the last seven years dealing with it since learning in 1998 that McGwire used the supplement androstenedione.
Selig said baseball had researched and studied androstenedione, initiated a minor league testing program, urged Congress to ban over the counter sales of steroid precursors and made steroids a priority in negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement.
San Francisco's Barry Bonds, whose Major League Baseball feats have been dogged by unproven steroid suspicions, became the oldest player to win the National League Most Valuable Player award on Monday.
The 40 year old slugger, poised to challenge the all time home run record, won the award for the fourth year in a row and seventh time overall.
Willie Stargell was the previous oldest to win the award, doing so in 1979 at age 39.
Bonds, who hit his 700th career homer in September, received 24 of 32 first place votes and 407 points overall in balloting by writers to claim his fourth consecutive league MVP honor.
Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre was second, 96 points back with six first place votes, and St. Louis slugger Albert Pujols was third with one first place vote and 247 points.
Bonds testified before a grand jury looking into the BALCO steroid scandal and his personal trainer, Greg Anderson, was among four men charged in the case.
Bonds had steadfastly denied any wrongdoing.
Major League Baseball did not institute a full steroid testing program until this season, but a steroid previously undetectable by testing was at the heart of the BALCO case.
With 703 career homers, Bonds trails only Hank Aaron's record 755 and Babe Ruth's 714 on the all time homers list.
Bonds, fourth in homers with 45, led the NL in batting (.362), on base percentage (.609) and was second in runs scored with 129.
Bonds set a major league record with 232 walks, more than 100 more than the next closest player.
His 120 intentional walks were 52 beyond the old record.
BALCO head Victor Conte was sentenced to eight months on Tuesday as part of a plea deal for his role as mastermind behind a scheme to provide professional athletes with undetectable performance enhancing drugs.
Conte, who will spend four months in prison and four months in home confinement, started the Bay Area Laboratory Co Operative.
The lab, according to court records, counted dozens of prominent athletes among its clients, including Olympic track champion Marion Jones, major league baseball's Barry Bonds and Jason Giambi, and others.
James Valente, BALCO's vice president, was sentenced to probation after pleading guilty to reduced charges of steroid distribution.
Greg Anderson, Bonds' trainer, was sentenced to six months after pleading guilty to money laundering and a steroid distribution charge.
He must spend three months behind bars and three months in home confinement.
The case prompted U.S. pro sports to stiffen anti doping policies and thrust performance enhancing drugs into the spotlight.
THG, a once unknown steroid discovered in the investigation, is now banned throughout sports.
Conte pleaded guilty in July to money laundering and a steroid distribution charge, dozens of counts were dropped.
Anderson and Conte remain free on bond and are scheduled to surrender to prison authorities on Dec 1.
U.S. Attorney Kevin Ryan in San Francisco has said the plea deals were spurred in part by weak steroid laws and by the fact that some of the chemicals were not banned at the time.
Track coach Remi Korchemny is expected to get probation at a later sentencing date.
Still, authorities are now taking aim at the alleged BALCO suppliers.
Last month, the authorities raided a laboratory in Champaign, Illinois headed by Patrick Arnold, who's known for introducing the steroid precursor androstenedione to the U.S.
Andro came to public attention in 1998 when St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire said he used it when breaking MLB's home run record.
Major League Baseball star Rafael Palmeiro may not be the only Baltimore Oriole in hot water after he told an arbitration panel that a teammate provided him with an unknown substance.
Citing two unnamed sources, the Baltimore Sun reported Thursday that Palmeiro told the panel of the substance.
But it is still unsure if the substance has been linked to his positive steroid test.
The New York Times reported last month that Palmeiro tested positive for the anabolic steroid stanozolol which is most notably linked to the Olympic sprinter Ben Johnson of Canada.
Johnson was stripped of his gold medal in 1988 after testing positive for that steroid.
Palmeiro, one of four players in baseball history with 3000 hits and 500 home runs, was suspended for 10 days in August for his positive test after his grievance was denied by an arbitration panel.
A congressional committee is looking into Palmeiro's reported claim as part of an investigation into whether he committed perjury when he emphatically denied ever using steroids at a hearing before Congress in March.
After his positive steroid test, Palmeiro told an arbitration panel that he never "intentionally" used steroids.
However, he could not explain how the drugs got into his body.
The Orioles sent Palmeiro to his home in Texas earlier this month to rehab an injured knee.
Palmeiro had gone two for 26 and played under intense scrutiny since returning from his 10 day suspension.
The 40 year old Palmeiro is hitting .266 with 18 homers and 60 RBI in 100 games this season.
With 569 homers and 3020 hits in his 19 year career, Palmeiro was believed to be headed for the Hall of Fame.
But that was before his legacy was soiled by the positive steroid test.
In a letter to the players' union, baseball commissioner Bud Selig has admitted that the newly revised steroid policy is not enough.
The commissioner is proposing suspending players for nearly one third of a season for a first offense.
Selig will no longer applaud or take pains to defend the current steroid policy, as he so fervently attempted during a contentious, 11 hour congressional hearing in March.
Addressing his letter to players' union boss Donald Fehr last week, Selig said he wants to abolish the taint that the steroid controversy has brought to the national pastime.
Instead of the current 10 game suspension for first offenders, Selig proposes a 50 game suspension in a 162 game season.
Instead of the current 30 game suspension for second time offenders, Selig wants the penalty increased to 100 games.
Instead of a 60 day suspension for third time offenders, Selig wants a lifetime ban.
Three strikes, and a player is out.
Under the current policy, players don't receive a lifetime ban until a fifth offense.
"Whoever would be stupid enough to get caught once would surely stop under this new proposal," said Colorado Rockies pitcher Jason Jennings.
"Fifty games, that's a big hit.
It would definitely be a deterrent."
Selig also requested that amphetamines be added to the list of banned substances that includes steroids, steroid precursors, masking agents, ephedrine, Androstenedione and human growth hormone.
"We're going to let the letter speak for itself and make no further comment," said Rob Manfred, Major League Baseball's top labor lawyer and the man who oversees the drug policy.
Manfred did say Selig's proposals would become part of the minor league steroid policy next season.
Minor leaguers not on 40 man, big league rosters are not protected by the Players' Association.
As for getting his proposal to fly with the players, Selig may count on escalating pressure from the public and the House Government Reform Committee that chastised baseball officials at a March 17 hearing.
It has threatened to institute an independent, all sports drug testing system unless baseball strengthens its policy.
"I have grave concerns about the damage that has been done to Major League Baseball by players' use of performance enhancing substances," Selig wrote to Fehr.
"The use of such substances ,(present) a fundamental challenge to the integrity of the game."
The players union is expected to balk at the proposal.
Among the concerns that have been raised since baseball began formal drug testing last season is the realization that several steroid agents stay in a person's blood stream for six months or longer.
This would present the possibility that even if a player swore off steroids after using them once, he still could eventually face a lifetime ban if regularly tested under Selig's proposal.
The players also may argue that they made the unprecedented move of re opening the collective bargaining agreement in January to strengthen the steroid proposal.
In the initial steroid policy implemented last season, first offenders were not punished and players were tested just once.
The policy was revised this season to subject players to unlimited testing and to punish first offenders.
Union leaders are expected to argue that implementing even harsher penalties before the new one is two months old would leave the players worried that no matter what they do, it would never be enough.
"I thought we already negotiated this," said Rockies star Todd Helton.
"I don't think we ought to negotiate things because the press wants us to."
The collective bargaining agreement doesn't expire until after the 2006 season.
The players also could argue that early indications of the current drug testing policy is it's the best among the four major sports.
The NFL has been testing for steroids for 15 years and has suspended 54 active players, an average of 3.6 per year.
Baseball's revised steroid testing program has suspended four players in two months.
Although steroid use is believed rampant in many sports, baseball has taken the brunt of the controversy, in part because many past and present star sluggers including Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire, Jason Giambi and Gary Sheffield have been linked to use of the illegal substance.
McGwire set the single season home run record with 70 in 1998, and Bonds broke it three years later with 73.
"Congress is so adamant about cleaning up steroids in baseball, they ought to clean up some of the stuff they're doing," said Rockies outfielder Dustan Mohr.
"I don't think all of them are saints either."
The US Congress has launched an undercover probe into illegal steroid use in Major League Baseball as well as other professional and amateur sports, a senior member of Congress said Sunday.
"We have an ongoing investigation.
We are doing other investigations undercover into professional and amateur sports," said Representative Tom Davis, chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, who last week called some of baseball's most fabled sluggers before a daylong hearing on steroid use in the sport.
"We've held other hearings on drug abuse, but nobody comes to them.
You bring professional baseball players and the world comes to it," Davis told the CBS News program "Face the Nation."
"I think it is a good start, but we consider steroid abuse to still be rampant and we're going to have a lot more to say," the Virginia Republican said.
On Thursday a roster of baseball's heavy hitters, including Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro and Sammy Sosa, testified at the hearing.
Asked Sunday whether baseball officials knew about the probe, Davis responded: "They do now."
A top baseball official with Major League Baseball said they were caught off guard by news of the probe.
"That's the first we heard of that," said Rob Manfred, an executive vice president with the league told CBS.
"Obviously the committee has the authority to conduct investigations.
We understand that steroids are an illegal substance in the United States, and anybody who uses those substances is obviously at risk, not only under our policies but more importantly, under the laws of the United States," Manfred said.
Federal prosecutors are seeking access to urine samples taken from Major League Baseball (MLB) players in 2003 while the MLB Players Association fights to protect the identity of 104 steroid cheats.
Lawyers from the US Attorney's office and the baseball union argued in a San Francisco court hearing last Tuesday over granting access for prosecutors in the ongoing BALCO steroid case that has already produced four convictions.
Three federal judges backed the union last year with rulings that said the government improperly used search warrants, preventing the government from keeping urine samples and identifying paperwork linking them to players.
The 2003 tests were taken as an anonymous study to judge the level of the steroid problem in the sport, results finishing well above the five percent level needed to create a punishable steroid testing program in 2004.
Union officials, who agreed Tuesday to a tougher punishment program for steroid and amphetamine dope cheats, want samples and records to stay at the labs where they are stored rather than given to BALCO investigators, fearing a leak to the public as happened with the grand jury.
The union argues the government should not be able to take records for hundreds of athletes, only from 10 with links to the BALCO case that were outlined in a search warrant including stars Barry Bonds, Jason Giambi and Gary Sheffield.
Samples and records from the 2003 survey were to have been destroyed, but when the BALCO steroid scandal began just before the end of the 2003 season, prosecutors filed subpoenas for all the samples and paperwork.
Baseball bosses and union leaders objected.
Talks on a compromise of seizing only 10 samples failed and the fight continues.
US chemist Patrick Arnold, 39, has pleaded innocent to charges of conspiring to distribute performance enhancing drugs to athletes.
He is due back in court later this month.
Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig asked players to agree to a 50 game suspension for first time steroid offenders and a lifetime ban for a third violation under what he called a "three strikes and you are out approach" to doping.
In a letter sent this week to players union head Donald Fehr, Selig proposed a 100 game ban for a second offense.
He also asked the union to ban amphetamines, to have more frequent random tests and to appoint an independent person to administer the MLB drug testing program.
"Third offenders should be banned permanently.
I recognize the need for progressive discipline, but a third time offender has no place in the game," Selig wrote to Fehr.
"Steroid users cheat the game.
After three offenses, they have no place in it."
Under the rules that began this season, a first offense gets a 10 day suspension, with the penalty increasing to 30 days for a second positive test, 60 days for a third and one year for a fourth.
For a fifth positive, the penalty is at the commissioner's discretion.
MLB has no penalties for amphetamine use by players on major league rosters, but are banned for players under minor league contracts.
Reached Saturday, Fehr said the union was not yet prepared to discuss Selig's proposal.
"We'll respond in due course," Fehr said, adding he anticipated replying early next week.
The proposal comes six weeks after several officials, players and former players testified before the U.S. Congress regarding MLB's doping policy following revelations by some and accusations of widespread steroid use within the league.
Among those accused is San Francisco Giants outfielder Barry Bonds, who broke the single season home run record in 2001 and is closing on career leaders Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth.
According to published reports, Bonds told a federal grand jury he unknowingly used a steroid cream provided by the Bay Area Laboratory Co Operative, which is at the center of a government investigation that also has implicated 100 meter world record holder Tim Montgomery and Olympic champion Marion Jones.
The chairman of a Congressional panel looking into steroid use in Major League Baseball chided the sport's leaders Thursday for being uncooperative and urged star players subpoenaed his hearing to "take public responsibility" for their actions.
The U.S. government has stepped in to investigate steroid use among professional baseball players use because it felt the sport wasn't doing enough to enforce its own policies.
The Government Reform Committee was hearing from six subpoenaed players, including Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, along with commissioner Bud Selig and other baseball executives, medical experts and the parents of two amateur athletes who committed suicide after taking steroids.
"Major League Baseball and the players' association greeted word of our inquiry first as a nuisance, then as a negotiation, replete with misstatements," committee chairman Tom Davis said in his opening statement.
"I understand their desire to avoid the public's prying eye,But I think they misjudged our seriousness of purpose," he said.
"I think they misjudged the will of an American public who believes that sunshine is the best disinfectant."
Selig sat with arms crossed and lips pursed as Davis and ranking minority member Henry Waxman chastised him and his sport.
"There is a pyramid of steroid use in society and today our investigation starts where it should with the owners and players at the top of that pyramid," Waxman said.
Without immunity from prosecution, some players were thought to be considering invoking their Fifth Amendment right to refuse to answer questions.
Addressing the players, Davis said some "have an opportunity today to either clear their name or take public responsibility for their action, and perhaps offer cautionary tales to our youth."
New York Mets pitcher Felix Heredia, who appeared in just three Major League Baseball games last season, became the fifth reliever to be suspended for violating the new steroid policy.
The office of the commissioner announced Heredia's 10 day ban on Tuesday.
The suspension will begin at the start of the 2006 campaign.
Heredia is the second player to be suspended since the end of the 2005 regular season.
Righthander Carlos Almanzar of the Texas Rangers was banned earlier this month for the first 10 days of the 2006 season.
A total of 11 major leaguers have been suspended for violating MLB's drug policy this year.
Major League Baseball slugger Barry Bonds could face a suspension if new claims detailing a history of doping are proven true, the Chicago Tribune reported Thursday.
Citing unnamed sources within the sport, the newspaper reported that major league commissioner Bud Selig is considering a suspension for the San Francisco Giants star among a wide range of possible responses.
The report also said a ruling could be made before the Giants' April 3 season opener.
The Tribune also reported that Selig met with Bonds during spring training in 2004 over concerns about claims that Bonds took steroids.
Selig made a vague offer of leniency to Bonds if he had anything to confess, the Tribune reported, but also warned that consequences would be "much worse" if he proclaimed innocence and evidence blater revealed him as a steroid user.
Bonds is 47 home runs shy of Hank Aaron's all time major league record of 755 career homers as he prepares for what he has said would be his farewell season.
Bonds was set to make his spring training debut Thursday for the Giants, two days after excerpts from the upcoming book "Game of Shadows" detailed a program of doping that began in 1998 and included his 2001 season, when he hit a one season major league record of 73 homers.
Selig's initial response after reading the book excerpts in Sports Illustrated was "Why am I not surprised now?
", the Tribune reported, adding that Selig has said, "It's even worse than I thought" about Bonds.
Greg Anderson, Bonds' personal trainer, was among four men convicted in the BALCO steroid distribution scandal.
The book claims Anderson helped Bonds take a wide range of performance enhancing drugs during seasons when the sport had no doping tests, not bound by World Anti Doping Agency rules.
Prompted by an upcoming book about Barry Bonds, an anti doping U.S. congressman wrote a letter on Wednesday asking Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig about his role in policing steroid use from 1998 02.
"As commissioner, you have the essential responsibility to safeguard the integrity of the game and to ensure that cheaters have no place in professional baseball," Cliff Stearns said in the letter.
Stearns' House Energy and Commerce subcommittee held hearings last year about steroid use and he introduced the Drug Free Sports Act, one of several bills that would have made U.S. sports leagues give players lifetime bans for a second or third doping offense.
Under pressure from Congress, MLB's players association agreed to toughen drug testing rules and penalties for 2005 and again this season.
Stearns asked Selig for information about a 2004 meeting with Bonds, MLB's policy for addressing alleged steroid use if a player doesn't fail a drug test, and what Selig's authority is to investigate alleged steroid use.
Bonds, who broke Mark McGwire's season homer record in 2001 and is approaching Babe Ruth's career total, is accused in an upcoming book of using steroids, human growth hormone and insulin for at least five seasons beginning in 1998.
MLB did not ban performance enhancing substances until after the 2002 season.
Last week, Selig wouldn't commit to investigating.
He said MLB will await publication of the book, "Game of Shadows," which is due out March 23, then decide how to proceed.
The New York Daily News, however, reported Thursday that Selig has already decided to begin an investigation, according to an unidentified baseball official.
The newspaper said Selig is expected to announce the decision next week, but hadn't yet decided if the investigation will be done by Major League Baseball officials or outside investigators.
The announcement Thursday that Syria was to conduct a final pullback of its troops to the eastern Bekaa valley of Lebanon falls short of the demands of the international community.
Following the killing of Lebanon's former prime minister Rafiq Hariri, Syria is under renewed pressure to abide by UN Security Council Resolution 1559 and end its political and military domination of its smaller neighbour.
Following are the main points of the resolution: UN Resolution 1559, passed by the Security Council on September 2, 2004, called for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon and respect for its sovereignty.
A specific reference to Syria was deleted at the last minute.
The resolution, originally proposed by France and the United States, said an upcoming elections should be "free and fair,according to Lebanese constitutional rules devised without foreign interference or influence."
The council "reaffirms its call for the strict respect of Lebanon's sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political independence under the sole and exclusive authority of the government of Lebanon throughout Lebanon."
The resolution had been amended from its original version to ensure its passage.
A demand "that Syrian forces withdraw without delay from Lebanon" was changed to a demand "that foreign forces withdraw without delay from Lebanon."
It called "for the disbanding and disarmament of all Lebanese and non Lebanese militias," and "supports the extension of the control of the government of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory."
The resolution was voted by nine of the 15 council members.
The other six abstained.
In a report published on October 3, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said: "The government of Syria has informed me that it cannot provide me with numbers and timetables for any future withdrawal.
"The requirements on the various parties set out in Resolution 1559 have not been met."
Annan said both Beirut and Damascus had indicated that Syrian troops were on the ground "at the invitation of Lebanon and that their presence is therefore by mutual agreement."
UN chief Kofi Annan has called for a Syrian troop pullout from Lebanon before April, warning that the Security Council could otherwise take "measures" against Damascus, in an interview with Al Arabiya television, the news channel said Thursday.
Annan "called on Syria to withdraw its troops from Lebanon before April, when he is due to present a report to the Security Council about Damascus' compliance with Resolution 1559," Dubai based Al Arabiya said.
In the interview, which is to be aired in full on Friday, Al Arabiya said the UN chief warned that "the Security Council could take measures against Syria if it does not implement the resolution," which calls for a withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon.
Foreign ministers from all European Union (EU) member states, who gathered here for a meeting, on Wednesday urged Syria to withdraw its troops completely from Lebanon.
"The (EU) Council emphasizes that Syrian troops and intelligence services must be withdrawn completely, in accordance with a precise timetable," said a statement after the meeting.
The ministers called on Syria to implement rapidly the pledges made by Syrian President Bashar al Assad on March 12, 2005 to withdraw all Syrian troops from Lebanon.
The EU also urged Lebanon to hold a "free, fair and transparent "elections on schedule "without any outside interference or meddling".
The ministers hint that the EU would possibly dispatch an election observer mission to Lebanon.
The meeting also called on the Lebanese authorities to clear up the circumstances of the killing of the former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and identify those responsible.
Syria is under mounting pressure to pull its troops out of Lebanon completely and quickly, or will face political and economic isolation in the world community, The Washington Post reported Friday.
The ultimatum will be issued to Syria when Terje Roed Larsen, a top UN envoy on the Middle East issue, scheduled to meet Syrian President Bashar Assad on Saturday, the Post reported, quoting UN and US officials as saying.
The UN envoy will tell Assad that Syria will face political and economic isolation if he does not completely and quickly withdraw from Lebanon, the paper said.
Roed Larsen plans to inform Syria that the international community is united in insisting that Damascus comply with U.N. Resolution 1559 and is prepared to impose wide punitive sanctions if it does not act quickly, the paper quoted officials as saying.
Over the past weeks, the UN envoy has reportedly met with US, European and Arab officials to determine the positions in preparation for the diplomatic confrontation.
Roed Larsen, according to the report quoting the UN source as saying, will tell the Syrian president to take the following four steps.
First, Syria must honor the independent sovereignty of Lebanon and not undermine its spring elections for a new parliament.
Second, Syria must provide a complete timeline for a full pullout of its troops.
Third, Syria must provide a timeline for the pullout of its 5, 000 intelligence agents in Lebanon.
Finally, Roed Larsen will discuss other requirements in Resolution 1559, including the need to disarm and dismantle foreign and domestic militias operating in Lebanon.
Since the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri on Feb 14, Syria has been under strong pressure to be out of Lebanon completely, though it decided to withdraw its troops to east part of Lebanon from Beirut.
The United States on Tuesday hailed Syria's troop pullout from Lebanon as a "historic" day for the Lebanese but stayed wary of Damascus' intention pending UN verification of the withdrawal.
Officials here also ducked questions on whether the move would improve strained US Syrian relations and lead to the return of Washington's ambassador to Damascus who was recalled for consultations in February.
"We think today is a historic day for Lebanon and its people," Ereli told the daily State Department briefing.
"After almost three decades Syria has withdrawn its military forces from Lebanon."
He called the pullout "an important first step" towards compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1559 adopted last year to order Syria's forces out of neighboring Lebanon.
But he added that Syria was also obliged to withdraw its intelligence officers and "I think there are some lingering concerns that not all Syrian intelligence assets are out of Lebanon."
The United Nations has sent a team of inspectors to Lebanon and Damascus, Ereli said, and "we await the report of this verification team to provide a considered judgment on whether the withdrawal is complete."
Syrian President Bashar al Assad on Saturday announced a plan to withdraw troops from Lebanon.
"Syrian troops will pull back to Bekaa valley in eastern Lebanon and then to the Syrian Lebanese border," Assad told the parliament in a speech delivered in Arabic.
He said through the move, Syria will fulfill its commitment to the Taif Accord and implementing UN Security Council resolution 1559, which calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon.
The Taif Accord ended Lebanon's 1975 90 civil war.
The president said, however, the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon does not mean the absence of a Syrian role in Lebanon, and the influence of Syria over Lebanon does not depend on the deployment of troops.
"Everybody has a view that the withdrawal is a problem, but this is the simplest thing.
Syria does not reject the principal of withdrawal," he said.
"We do not want to stay in Lebanon," he said, adding that Syrian troops have begun the pullback process.
He also called for boosting bilateral ties through varying dimensions culture, the economy and education.
Syria, a key power broker of Lebanon, has been mounting pressure to withdraw its 14000 soldiers from Lebanon since the death of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri last month.
UN envoy Terje Roed Larsen said Sunday that the Syrian government has pledged to remove all Syrian troops and intelligence agents from Lebanon by April 30.
Larsen made the statement at a joint news conference with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al Shara after talks with President Bashar al Assad.
"All Syrian troops as well as the intelligence apparatus will be completely withdrawn by April 30," said Larsen.
Larsen, UN special envoy for the implementation of UN Resolution 1559 which demands Syria to quit Lebanon, will also hold talks with senior Lebanese officials in Beirut on the withdrawal timetable on Monday.
Under mounting pressures from the international community and Lebanese opposition, Syria has carried out the first stage of a two phase withdrawal plan, with nearly 4000 troops out of 14000 pulled out of Lebanon.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan as well as Lebanese opposition leaders have called upon Syria to complete withdrawal before Lebanon's parliamentary elections in May.
The killing of Lebanon's former prime minister Rafiq Hariri has triggered fresh calls for Syria to abide by UN Security Council Resolution 1559 and end its domination of its smaller neighbour.
Following are the main points of the resolution: UN Resolution 1559, passed by the Security Council on September 2, 2004, called for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon and respect for its sovereignty.
A specific reference to Syria was deleted at the last minute.
The resolution, originally proposed by France and the United States, said an upcoming elections should be "free and fair,according to Lebanese constitutional rules devised without foreign interference or influence."
The council "reaffirms its call for the strict respect of Lebanon's sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political independence under the sole and exclusive authority of the government of Lebanon throughout Lebanon."
The resolution had been amended from its original version to ensure its passage.
A demand "that Syrian forces withdraw without delay from Lebanon" was changed to a demand "that foreign forces withdraw without delay from Lebanon."
It called "for the disbanding and disarmament of all Lebanese and non Lebanese militias," and "supports the extension of the control of the government of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory."
The resolution was voted by nine of the 15 council members.
The other six abstained.
In a report published on October 3, UN secretary general Kofi Annan said: "The government of Syria has informed me that it cannot provide me with numbers and timetables for any future withdrawal.
"The requirements on the various parties set out in Resolution 1559 have not been met."
Annan said both Beirut and Damascus had indicated that Syrian troops were on the ground "at the invitation of Lebanon and that their presence is therefore by mutual agreement."
Egypt and Saudi Arabia are trying to persuade Syria to accept a timetable to withdraw its 15000 troops from Lebanon, maybe by the end of April, Arab diplomats said Tuesday.
Calls for Syria's withdrawal, a key demand of Lebanon's anti Damascus forces, Washington and the United Nations, have risen to fever pitch since the Feb 14 assassination of ex Lebanese premier Rafik Hariri and Monday's resignation of Lebanon's pro Damascus government.
The Arab diplomats, speaking in Cairo on condition of anonymity, said the Egyptian Saudi proposal is based on the 1989 Arab brokered Taif Accord that ended Lebanon's 1975 90 civil war.
Syrian troops were sent to Lebanon as part of an Arab peacekeeping force in 1976.
The agreement secured in the Saudi city of Taif called for Syria to redeploy its troops in Lebanon within two years before a full withdrawal later.
But Syria has not complied with the accord, something which is fanning massive anti Damascus discontent in Lebanon, where many blame Syria and the toppled Lebanese government of involvement in Hariri's killing.
Both governments have denied any role.
"The Arabs sent in the Syrians to Lebanon and they can ask them now to pull out," said one diplomat familiar with the efforts.
Egyptian and Saudi officials are discussing a formula to persuade Syria to declare a withdrawal timetable, "possibly as soon as possible," another Arab diplomat said.
"The objective is not to please the United States nor the international community, but rather to save Syria from a serious conflict that will pitch it against the whole word," he said.
Cairo and Riyadh want to avoid a repeat of their failure to convince toppled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein to defuse his crisis with the United States before the 2003 invasion of Iraq that toppled his regime.
The United States and France have been leading calls for Syria to withdraw from Lebanon.
Washington has accused Syria of aiding the anti U.S. insurgency in Iraq.
It also linked Friday's Tel Aviv suicide bombing to Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants based in Syria.
Damascus has denied the claims.
"The Syrians are out of step with where the region is going and out of step with the aspirations of the people of the Middle East," U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told reporters while in London for an international conference on the Palestinians.
The latest edition of Time magazine quotes Syrian President Bashar Assad as saying he would withdraw his troops completely "maybe in the next few months.
Not after that."
In reaction to the Time report, Syria appeared to back off the comments.
A Syrian official, speaking on condition of anonymity in Damascus, denied the magazine's comments that a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon would come within months, saying the Taif Accord is the basis for this matter.
The 1989 accord does not necessarily rule out a full withdrawal within months.
It calls for a redeployment to eastern Lebanon near the border, with a full pullout subject to negotiation.
One of the Arab envoys said Egypt and Saudi Arabia are proposing Syria start an immediate, token withdrawal with a full pull out completed before the end of April.
The Egyptian Saudi initiative is expected to be raised during a meeting of Arab foreign ministers in Cairo late Wednesday ahead of an official meeting Thursday to prepare for an Arab leadership summit later in the month in Algeria.
Syrian Cabinet minister Buthaina Shaaban criticized Arab states for indifference toward American plans "to restructure the area."
"What are Arab governments doing in this or that targeted state in this (American) scheme of change," Shaaban wrote in Monday's edition of London based Asharq Al Awsat.
Egyptian and Saudi officials have not talked publicly about the initiative, which also calls on Damascus to fully cooperate with an international effort to investigate Hariri's killing.
Secretary General Kofi Annan said Thursday he is sending a top envoy back to Beirut and Damascus to discuss U.N. demands for a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon, which he said must be handled with care.
Terje Roed Larsen, the U.N.'s former Mideast envoy who is still handling the Syria Lebanon issue, will prepare a report on Syria's compliance with a Security Council resolution demanding the pullout of its 15000 troops and intelligence agents.
"The Syrians have indicated that they are planning to withdraw the troops from Lebanon," Annan told reporters.
"Will it be complete withdrawal, partial withdrawal?"
Annan said he hopes when he submits the report to the Security Council in April "that I will be able to report progress."
The secretary general was asked how soon he would like to see the Syrians withdraw, and how concerned he was that a speedy pullout might create a political vacuum that might unsettle Syria's adversaries, the Israelis.
"Obviously, it's a situation one has to handle with care," Annan said, adding that all interested parties are aware of the need to avoid precipitating "a situation that could destabilize Lebanon or cause tensions."
Roed Larsen was in the region last month and his office said contacts were being made with the Syrian and Lebanese governments on dates for his return.
Pressure on Syria to withdraw its troops and intelligence agents has intensified since the slayings of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and 16 others in a Feb 14 bombing.
Many Lebanese blame Syria for the assassination, though Damascus vehemently denies any involvement.
Lebanon's worst political crisis in years has increasingly isolated Syria, with Egypt and Saudi Arabia stepping in to encourage Damascus to withdraw.
Even Syria's traditional ally, Russia, joined the United States, France and the United Nations in calling for a pullout.
Syria sent troops in 1976 to help quell a civil war in Lebanon.
They remained through 14 years of fighting and are still there.
Damascus is seen as pulling the strings in Lebanese politics most recently in pressing for a constitutional amendment to allow a second term for pro Syrian President Emile Lahoud.
The Security Council adopted a resolution Sept 2 calling on Syria to pull all its troops from its smaller neighbor and urging Lebanon's parliament not to amend the constitution.
Defying the council, parliament approved an amendment hours later extending Lahoud's term for three years.
US President George W. Bush issued a new warning to Syria on Friday to withdraw its forces from Lebanon, with the White House saying it believed the Damascus government has a hit list of opponents in Lebanon.
Bush said he was "disturbed" by reports that Syrian intelligence remain in Lebanon, in breach of a UN resolution ordering all Syrian forces out of the country.
"Our message to Syria and it's not just the message of the United States, the United Nations has said the same thing is that in order for Lebanon to be free," Syria needs to "not only remove their military, but to remove intelligence officers as well," Bush said at the White House.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on Friday ordered a UN verification mission back to Lebanon because of reports of "elements" of Syrian intelligence still in the country which is halfway through a four stage national election.
A UN Security Council resolution passed in September ordered all foreign nations to withdraw their forces from Lebanon.
Syria has strongly denied that any of its forces remain in the neighbouring country where it has had a predominant influence for three decades.
In Damascus, Information Minister Mehdi Dakhlallah said the comments by Bush and other US administration officials were "false and lacking in objectivity".
"All Syrian forces, whatever their service, have been withdrawn from Lebanon," the minister told the official SANA news agency.
White House spokesman Scott McClellan said the United States was "deeply concerned about Syria's interference and intimidation inside Lebanon."
He welcomed the return of the UN mission.
"Syria needs to comply fully with United Nations Council Resolution 1559.
That means getting all their intelligence operatives out of Lebanon," he added.
"We are concerned that those intelligence operatives are interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs."
McClellan also spoke of a Syrian "hit list" of opponents of its influence.
"There are reports that we have been hearing about for some time about a Syrian hit list targeting key Lebanese public figures of various political and religious persuasions for assassination," McClellan told a briefing.
He said the reports had resurfaced following the recent assassination of anti Syrian journalist Samir Kassir.
The State Department has also warned about Syria's role in the Lebanese election, but spokesman Sean McCormack held back from the use of sanctions that could be applied under the Syria Accountability Act. "This is not an issue between the US and Syria, this is an issue between Syria and the rest of the world," McCormack told a briefing Friday.
A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the number of Syrian agents in Lebanon had not reduced despite the withdrawal promise by Damascus.
Terje Roed Larsen, the UN secretary general's envoy for Lebanon, is to meet Syria's President Bashir Al Assad in Damascus on Sunday to discuss the Syrian withdrawal and the UN resolution.
An opposition leader charged Thursday that Syrian military intelligence was still operating in Lebanon, six weeks after Syria withdrew its troops from the country, and said he feared there would be more assassinations.
Speaking on local television, Walid Jumblatt, the leader of Lebanon's Druse community, said Syrian generals had been spotted in eastern Bekaa Valley and central Lebanon.
"Officially, the Syrians have left.
But on the intelligence level they stayed," Jumblatt said in a talk show on LBC television.
Syrian intelligence in Lebanon "is not to monitor Israel.
It is in order for the tutelage and the sabotage to continue," he said, referring to Syria's past domination of the Lebanese security service.
"The Lebanese intelligence apparatus, or its remnants, and the Syrian intelligence apparatus still exist in Lebanon," Jumblatt added.
His comments came ahead of a U.N. envoy's traveling to Damascus this weekend to meet the Syrian President Bashar Assad.
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said Thursday he was considering sending another team to verify the reports of Syrian intelligence operatives remaining in Lebanon.
A U.N. military team was sent to Lebanon last month to verify the withdrawal of all Syrian troops and intelligence operatives, as called for by the U.N. Security Council in a September 2004 resolution.
It verified the pullout of all Syrian troops, but said it could not be certain that all intelligence operatives had left Lebanon.
U.N. diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several countries have told Annan there is evidence that Syrian intelligence operatives are still in Lebanon, performing a variety of activities.
U.S. officials have made no secret of their concern that Syrian intelligence officers may still be in Lebanon.
In his interview, Jumblatt said Brig.
Gen. Rustum Ghazale, Syria's last intelligence chief in Lebanon, was seen having lunch in one of the restaurants in the eastern Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border.
He also said several Syrian generals were spotted in Lebanon.
They include Ali Diab and Mahmoud Jabbour, who were spotted in the Chouf, the Druse heartland in central Lebanon.
Jumblatt expressed fears of further assassinations after last week's bombing that killed the anti Syrian journalist, Samir Kassir.
"Probably there is a decision with the knowledge or without the knowledge of President Assad to continue the assassinations," he said.
Lebanon's opposition has blamed Syria and its Lebanese allies in the government for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in bomb explosion on Feb 14 that killed 20 others people.
His killing sparked mass anti Syrian protests in Lebanon and intensified international pressure for Syria to withdraw its army.
The pullout was completed April 26.
Polling stations opened Sunday in Mount Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley for the third round of Lebanon's general elections amid US accusations that Syria has failed to completely withdraw from the country and is meddling in its affairs.
A total of 1.2 million voters, aged over 21, are eligible to elect 23 lawmakers 14 Muslims and nine Christians in the Bekaa's three districts and another 35 25 Christians and 10 Muslims in Mount Lebanon's four districts, chosing among a total of 262 candidates.
Muslims who won landslide victories in the first two rounds of voting in recent weeks but Christian candidates were gearing up for a fierce battle on Sunday.
The White House said Monday that Lebanon's parliamentary elections appeared to be going well but said the United States still worries about Syrian influence over its neighbor's internal affairs.
"Generally speaking, people feel that the elections are being conducted well," spokesman Scott McClellan said with three rounds of voting completed and one more round remaining.
"I think most people are looking at this and would say that the people of Lebanon are casting votes for change.
But in terms of the actual individuals that are being elected, that's up to the people of Lebanon to decide," he said.
The elections were the first since Syria withdrew its military in April, after a 29 year military presence, in the turmoil that followed the February killing of former premier Rafiq Hariri.
"What we want to make sure is that there are free and fair elections and that there is no outside interference or intimidation going on inside Lebanon.
That means Syria needs to stop meddling inside Lebanon," said McClellan.
"We have real concerns about Syria's continued intelligence presence inside Lebanon," said McClellan.
The spokesman said UN verification teams should return to Lebanon and stay there through the formation of a cabinet in order to certify whether Syria is complying with a UN resolution calling for Damascus to withdraw from its neighbor's affairs.
Syria rejected accusations that it was behind the killing of a prominent anti Syrian Lebanese journalist on Thursday.
"A source at the Information Ministry strongly denounced some Lebanese media and political figures who rushed as usual to accuse Syria," the official SANA news agency said.
"This affirms their pre determined anti Syrian stances," the source said, accusing them of "seeking to satisfy the enemies of Syria, Lebanon and all Arabs in general".
Lebanese opposition figures quickly blamed Syria and its Lebanese allies for the death of Samir Qaseer, a journalist at Lebanon's leading daily An Nahar, who was killed when a bomb exploded in his car earlier in the day in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.
Syria also denied the charge that it was involved in the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al Hariri in February, which prompted mass pressure on Damascus to withdraw its troops from Lebanon in April after 29 year presence.
Syria's ambassador to the United States denied Sunday that Damascus has a "hit list" targeting Lebanese opposition leaders and insisted that his country had withdrawn intelligence officers from Lebanon.
Syrian Ambassador Imad Moustapha told CNN it was in his country's "strategic interest" to have the "best possible" relations with its smaller neighbor, whose political opposition held protests this year against Syria's 29 year troop presence in Lebanon.
"There are forces that don't want to see a good, friendly, brotherly relation between Syria and Lebanon, and they are creating this myth and these stories about Syria going to kill Lebanese leaders," he said.
President George W. Bush on Friday called on Syria to remove intelligence agents from Lebanon, while White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Washington had heard reports of a Syrian "hit list" against key Lebanese public figures.
"It's a shame that the world's unique superpower, the United States of America, would degrade itself to this level," Moustapha said.
"Do you instigate against a whole country based on unsubstantiated wild stories," he said, adding that the allegations have "exceeded all limits of wisdom and of logic."
He also insisted that Syria has removed all troops and intelligence agents from Lebanon.
"We have made a strategic decision.
We have withdrawn from Lebanon completely and categorically, every Syrian troop, every Syrian agent," he said.
"This is a sinister campaign against Syria that is unjustified, inacurate and unfair," Moustapha said.
A US and French backed UN Security Council resolution passed in September ordered all foreign nations to withdraw their forces from Lebanon, whose voters on Sunday went to the polls for a third round of legislative elections.
The elections, which will be held in four stages, is the first balloting free of Syria's military presence, and follows the February killing of former prime minister Rafiq Hariri which plunged Lebanon into turmoil.
A U.N. team has verified the pullout of all Syrian troops and intelligence officials from Lebanon, Secretary General Kofi Annan announced Monday.
"We have verified all the withdrawal, including the border area," he told reporters.
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution last Sept 2 calling on Syria to withdraw all its troops and intelligence operatives from Lebanon.
But it was the international pressure following the Feb 14 assassination of Lebanon's former anti Syrian prime minister, Rafik Hariri, that spurred the Syrians to leave.
Syria's last soldier in Lebanon walked across the border on April 26, ending a 29 year military presence that was the key to Damascus' control of Lebanon.
The United Nations dispatched a team led by Senegalese Brig.
Gen. Mouhamadou Kandji, the deputy military adviser for the U.N. peacekeeping department, to verify the withdrawal.
An official Syrian newspaper on Saturday dismissed as "lies" American allegations that Syria still maintained troops or intelligence officials in Lebanon following their full withdrawal in April.
"We dare any country or side to come up with evidence that we still have forces or intelligence (agents) in Lebanon," Tishrin newspaper said in an editorial.
",Is it Syria's responsibility to maintain security in Lebanon and Iraq?"
U.S. officials said Thursday Washington was certain that Syrian military intelligence operatives remain in Lebanon in defiance of international demands to withdraw all forces and agents.
"There is no question that Syrian military intelligence agents have stayed behind, and that they are exerting a highly negative influence on the situation," a senior U.S. State Department official said.
Anti Syrian opposition politicians have also claimed that intelligence agents remain.
Syria claims all its forces quit Lebanon in April in line with a U.N. resolution after some three decades as the dominant political and military force there.
A United Nations verification team is currently in Lebanon to investigate whether any Syrian intelligence forces remain.
Referring to repeated U.S. allegations that Syria was not doing enough to prevent anti U.S. fighters from infiltrating into Iraq, Tishrin asked, "What is really demanded from Syria?"
It added that the U.S. accusations were aimed at forcing Syria to change its stance on the Arab Israeli conflict and Iraq.
Indirectly blaming the United States for the instability in the region, the paper said, "Why doesn't the Bush administration act ,against Israel's decision to continue the series of assassinations (against Palestinians)?"
The United Nations was encouraged by the talks its envoy had with Syria's president on the Security Council call for Syria to end its involvement in Lebanon, the U.N. said in a statement Monday.
U.N. envoy Terje Roed Larsen met Syrian President Bashar Assad for two hours in Damascus on Sunday amid accusations that Syria has not withdrawn all its intelligence agents from Lebanon and was continuing to meddle in Lebanese affairs.
Neither party issued a statement afterward, but the U.N. office in Beirut said Monday that Larsen's discussions with Assad were "constructive and helpful."
Larsen "will continue working together with President Assad, the Syrian government, and other parties for the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1559," the U.N. press release said.
The resolution, adopted in September last year, calls on Syria to withdraw all its military from Lebanon and for the disarmament of the Syrian backed guerrilla group in Lebanon, Hezbollah.
The United States and the Lebanese opposition leader Walid Jumblatt have alleged that Syria is continuing to maintain intelligence agents in Lebanon, despite its withdrawal of troops from Lebanon in April.
Washington said Syria could even be involved in recent assassinations in Lebanon.
Syria has denied the allegations as a smear campaign by Washington and an attempt to influence the staggered parliamentary elections that are taking place in Lebanon.
The U.N. office issued the statement following a meeting between Roed Larsen and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in Paris during which the secretary general was briefed on the meeting in Syria.
Annan instructed Roed Larsen last week to go to Syria to meet Assad for talks on Lebanon.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Tuesday met with visiting Saudi Foreign Minister Saud bin al Faisal over the Syria Lebanon issue, Egypt's official MENA news agency reported.
The meeting "covered Arab issues, especially the latest developments in Syria and Lebanon," Presidential spokesman Soliman Awad was quoted as saying.
Awad skipped a question whether Mubarak will visit Syria soon, but said Mubarak's "consultations are constant with all parties concerned in containing the situation in Syria and Lebanon."
Syria was forced to withdraw forces from Lebanon at the end of April by mass anti Syrian protests in Lebanon and mounting international pressure to quit its tiny neighbor.
The outpouring of public anger was triggered by the assassination of former Lebanese Premier Rafik Hariri on Feb 14 in a massive bombing in central Beirut.
Faisal arrived here earlier Tuesday on a brief visit to Egypt.
The Saudi minister left for home after talks with Mubarak.
The A380, the new Airbus "superjumbo" which will be officially unveiled Tuesday, is the product of a decade of designing, drumming up of advance orders and dreams of knocking Boeing's 747 off its perch as the top bird in passenger transport.
Here are some key dates in its development: Early 1990s: Airbus begins studying ideas for building an airliner capable of seating more than 500 passengers to compete against Boeing's 747, which started flying in 1970.
June 1994: Airbus begins engineering development of the plane, then known as the A3XX.
July 2000: Emirates Airlines becomes the first company to order the still under wraps plane, saying it wants to buy seven.
December 19, 2000: Airbus officially launches the plane, calling it the A380.
January 2001: The US freight company Federal Express announces the first order of the cargo version of the A380, reserving 10.
February 20, 2001: Airbus expands its plant in Hamburg, Germany to handle assembly of the interior of A380 cabins.
Assembly of the plane itself is to take place in Toulouse, France.
January 23, 2002: Production starts of Airbus A380 components.
July 16, 2002: French President Jacques Chirac lays the first stone in the vast Toulouse hangar used for assembling the A380.
June 15, 2003: Emirates increases its orders to 45 A380s.
July 4, 2003: Inauguration of an Airbus plant in Broughton, Wales, where wings for the A380 are to be made.
August 19, 2003: The first glimpse of the plane being put together in the French city of Nancy, when a big piece of fuselage is unveiled.
March 25, 2004: The front and central sections of the plane are unveiled at the plant in Saint Nazaire, France, as they are transported to Toulouse.
Special measures have to be made to allow the 50 metre long convoys to pass, taking up eight metres across and 12 metres high.
May 7, 2004: French Prime Minister Jean Pierre Raffarin inaugurates the Toulouse assembly line.
January 18, 2005: Airbus is to officially unveil a completed A380 in the presence of Chirac, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.
March 2005: Scheduled first test flight of the plane.
March 2006: Forecast start of the A380 entering commercial service with Singapore Airlines using it between London and Singapore.
2008: The first freight configured A380s are expected to take to the air.
European airplane maker Airbus "is likely to discuss before the end of the year" a possible increase in production capacity of its new super jumbo A380 aircraft, Airbus' production chief Gustav Humbert said in a magazine interview released Tuesday.
"We're already sold out until 2010," Humbert told the weekly Focus Money in comments released ahead of publication on Thursday.
"There is room" for an increase in capacity, he added.
Airbus has so far received orders for 149 of the new giant aircraft with the first delivery scheduled for 2006.
Production is expected to be running at full pelt from 2008.
US complaints about European government subsidies to Airbus Industrie have not stopped US airports preparing for the arrival of the giant A380 jet that is set to spark a new transatlantic trade dogfight.
A Monday deadline for an agreement is almost certain to pass without a result and the United States has said it will then take its complaint to the World Trade Organization.
Airbus is hoping the 550 seat A380, the world's biggest jet, will revolutionize air travel.
And even though no US airline has ordered the European jet, aviation authorities are getting Los Angeles, New York's John F. Kennedy airport, San Francisco and Miami airports ready for the A 380 passenger flights in 2006, according to Dave Bennett of the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Airport Safety and Standards.
"I don't see major safety or technical problems," said Bennett.
"We do expect the A380, soon after certificated to begin service at the US probably at 4 passengers airports initially and two more airports for freighters in 2008."
O'Hare airport in Chicago and Dulles in Washington will be ready later.
Memphis in Tennessee and Anchorage in Alaska should be ready for the cargo version of the A380 in 2008.
Federal Express has ordered 10 of the planes.
"The FAA has worked with each of these airports and the plans for operations of the A380 have been approved" None of the airports is yet ready to handle the weight or width of the A380, according to Bennett.
But he added that this should not be a major problem as the tonnage per wheel is no different from other aircraft.
The A380 will take over from the Boeing 747 as the biggest jet in the skies.
Its 540 tonne weight is 30 percent more than the 747 and its wingspan of 78 metres (257 feet) is 15 metres (50 feet) wider than Boeing's Jumbo jet.
But access routes from terminals to runways will have to be widened and bridges underneath runways will have to be strengthened.
The cost will be relatively modest, according to Dick Marchi, an expert on infrastructure for the Airport Council International North America.
He said a study was carried out which indicated each airport would have to spend about 80 million dollars to rebuild or widen taxiways and runway bridges for the A380.
Marchi said the figure should be even lower as none of the facilities will have to build a new runway.
The Airbus jet takes off from a shorter distance than its Boeing rival.
"There are things that need to be done, but for most of them it's not a disruptive change."
Many airports will not even need new terminals, just to change existing buildings so passengers can board and disembark on two levels, said Marchi.
Dan Cohen Nir, a Washington based technical official for Airbus North America, said one of the key strengths of the A380 was that it had been conceived to be used in airports that already take the Boeing 747, with the minimum of extra works.
Atlanta, one of the busiest airports in the world, has refused to make changes to accommodate the A380 saying that no airline using the Georgia hub had indicated it wanted to bring the new jet there.
But Cohen Nir said this was not important as most of its traffic is domestic.
The Airbus official said he had not seen any sign that the US authorities were throwing up barriers to the A380, even though its development is becoming a major transatlantic dispute.
The A380 'superjumbo', which will be presented to the world in a lavish ceremony in southern France on Tuesday, will be profitable from 2008, its maker Airbus told the French financial newspaper La Tribune.
"You need to count another three years," Airbus chief Noel Forgeard told Monday's edition of the newspaper when asked when the break even point of the 10 billion euro plus (13 billion dollar plus) A380 programme would come.
So far, 13 airlines have placed firm orders for 139 of the new planes, which can seat between 555 and 840 passengers and which have a catalogue price of between 263 and 286 million dollars (200 and 218 million euros).
The break even point is calculated to arrive when the 250th A380 is sold.
Airbus figures that, over the next two decades, more than 1200 aircraft of the size of the A380 will be required for point to point routes in the world.
Forgeard said "we are well above our market plan," and added that his aim was to bring in two new airlines as customers each year.
Asked about China adding its airlines' names to the order sheet, Forgeard said he predicted a firm order would be soon forthcoming.
"I am extremely confident that the A380 will be bought by a Chinese company in the first half of this year," he said, without elaborating.
In December, Forgeard hinted that an agreement in principle had been signed with a Chinese airline for five A380s, and Britain's Sunday Times newspaper cited industry sources who said that had been firmed up into actual orders with an option for another five, and that Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific was preparing a similar order.
The Airbus chief told La Tribune there would be Chinese representatives at Tuesday's unveiling ceremony in Toulouse, "notably from the China Southern airline."
After its glitzy debut, the new Airbus super jumbo jet A380 now must prove soon it can fly, and eventually turn a profit.
Airbus unveiled the world's biggest passenger jet Tuesday at a spectacular sound and light ceremony in Toulouse, southern France, where the leaders of France, Britain, Germany and Spain cheered Airbus's latest victory over Boeing for aviation dominance.
The spotlight moment came as Airbus celebrates its second straight year of besting Boeing in global aircraft sales, and an estimated 57 percent share of the passenger aircraft market.
At the ceremony in Toulouse, where Airbus is based, the company's chief executive Noel Forgeard indicated the maiden test flight for the A380 would be held in late March or early April.
But the exact date will be kept under wraps to "not put pressure on the test pilots," he said.
Indeed, time is short for the grandest project envisioned by the European aircraft maker to take a reality test.
The Airbus flagship is due to enter service next year.
The stakes could hardly be higher.
The development cost of the project amounts to 10.7 billion euros (13.9 billion dollars), borne by Airbus which is 80 percent owned by the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company and 20 percent by BAE Systems of Britain.
Airbus expects the project will break even in 2008 with the sales are a must for test pilots.
"Yes, it's true that we have a parachute on our backs and an evacuation hatch," he said in the radio interview.
"Perhaps not for the first flight, but for the later ones in which we'll test the plane's vibration norms and we try very, very high speeds to test its limits compared with normal flight, there is a little more risk."
Asked about the date for the test flights, Lelaie replied: "We will fly when the plane is ready.
As for us, we are ready."
The public will get its first look at the A380 super jumbo jet at the Paris Air Show in June.
And the first commercial deliveries to Singapore Airlines are due in the first quarter of 2006.
The A380, which will break the monopoly held by Boeing's 747 on the super jumbo market, represents a huge economic gamble for Airbus and symbolizes the emergence of Airbus as king of the skies.
The program, launched in December 2000, banks on a strategy of transporting huge numbers of passengers.
Boeing, for its part, is skeptical about the A380's commercial prospects and instead sees the need for long distance, fuel efficient flight, embodied in its future 7E7 plane.
Beyond the two rivals' differences on strategy, they do agree on at least one thing for their future planes: Both companies have chosen blue, grey and white color schemes.
An association of residents living near Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport on Wednesday denounced the noise pollution generated by the giant Airbus A380, after the new airliner's maiden flight.
French acoustics expert Joel Ravenel, a member of the Advocnar group representing those who live near Charles de Gaulle, told AFP he had recorded a maximum sound level of 88 decibels just after the aircraft took off from near the southwestern city of Toulouse.
The figure makes the world's largest commercial jet "one of the loudest planes that will for decades fly over the heads of the four million people living in the area" outside Paris, Advocnar said in a statement.
Ravenel said sound levels near Charles de Gaulle airport normally reached about 40 decibels.
Journalists watching the Airbus A380's first flight at Toulouse airport in southwestern France, however, noted how quiet the take off and landing had seemed.
Tens of thousands of spectators cheered as the A380 touched down at the airport near Toulouse, home of the European aircraft maker Airbus Industrie, after a test flight of three hours and 54 minutes.
Airbus, which has delivered more airplanes than Boeing for the second year in a row, is about to unveil another No. 1: the world's largest passenger jet.
The A380, a four aisle, four engine, double decker "superjumbo," will roll onto the tarmac Tuesday at Airbus headquarters in southern France, in a lavish ceremony attended by EU leaders and thousands of guests.
Sales have beat expectations so far, and most of the technical problems that have dogged the program have been resolved, at a price.
But the real sighs of relief won't be heard in Toulouse until later sometime before March 31, Airbus says when the A380 hauls its 280 metric ton (308 ton) frame aloft.
That's when the plane's engineers will begin to find out whether their gargantuan offspring lives up to the performance promises, as the first test flight data streams in.
In a standard three class cabin configuration, the A380 will carry 555 passengers one third more than the plane it is designed to displace, the Boeing 747.
On a full tank, it will also carry them 5 percent further than Boeing's longest range jumbo, Airbus claims, producing costs per passenger that are up to one fifth below its rival's.
Meeting these targets has been "no picnic," Airbus CEO Noel Forgeard acknowledged Wednesday, when he also confirmed that the A380 is both over budget and slightly overweight.
Forgeard said the plane will weigh in about 1 percent heavier than its target of 277 metric tons (305 tons) but stressed it will still deliver on promised fuel efficiency and other guarantees, since the internal benchmark was deliberately overambitious.
He said the program's euro1.45 billion (US$1.9 billion) overspend 18 percent of its US$10.7 billion (euro8.17 billion) overall budget at current exchange rates would likely be trimmed by a renewed cost cutting drive.
The struggle to meet weight targets accounts for much of the overspending, Airbus officials say.
Jean Claude Schoepf, head of the A380 final assembly line, said the problem became a headache early on.
"We found there was too much mass," Schoepf said.
"We had to work pretty hard to get back to the specifications we'd committed ourselves to with our clients."
Parts went back to the drawing board to be meticulously pared down, without sacrificing strength.
More carbon composites were introduced for example, in the horizontal struts that support the two cabin floors and hold the fuselage in shape.
By using chromate free paint, engineers got the outer paintwork down to about 350 kilograms (770 pounds), Schoepf said.
"That's compared to 550 kilograms (1210 pounds) for a plane of this size using other paints."
At the giant hangar where Schoepf and his 1500 engineers and support staff work, wings, nose cones and fuselage sections arrive by road convoys after being transported by barges from Bordeaux, western France, where they come in from Airbus facilities in Spain, Britain, Germany and elsewhere in France.
By 2008, Schoepf plans to hire another 1000 staff to boost the production rate to one A380 per week.
Airbus has 139 firm A380 orders from 13 airlines and freight companies, worth US$39 billion (euro30 billion) before any discounts on the plane's US$280 million list price.
A new 747 costs up to US$211 million before discounts.
The backlog will rise when UPS Inc. finalizes a deal to acquire 10 of the A380's freighter versions, with options on 10 more.
The European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co., which owns 80 percent of Airbus, says the A380 program will break even at about 250 sales.
Over the next 20 years, Airbus sees global demand for 1250 A380 size behemoths to shuttle passengers between the world's largest airports, which serve as connecting hubs for flights to less busy destinations.
More than half the new superjumbos will fly between just 10 major airports, Airbus forecasts, mainly in Asia.
Singapore Airlines Ltd. is scheduled to become the first carrier to operate the A380, in the second half of 2006.
Chicago based Boeing Co., like Airbus, expects overall air passenger traffic to increase threefold over the next two decades.
But Boeing forecasts only "a few hundred" sales of very large planes, as travelers reject stopovers in favor of direct service aboard smaller long range jets like its fuel efficient 7E7 Dreamliner, due to enter service in 2008.
"The data shows unquestionably that passengers, when they can, want to fly from wherever they are to wherever they're going, without having to connect in a hub," said Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher.
"The A380 is flying into the headwind of reality."
But Boeing, which delivered 285 planes in 2004 to Airbus' 320, is hedging its bets.
It announced plans last year for a larger, 450 seat 747, despite having dismissed the case for a bigger plane since Airbus began discussing the concept in 1991.
A launch decision is expected in mid 2005.
Whichever way the wind blows in Toulouse on Tuesday, the A380 seems certain to become a milestone in civil aviation history alongside the 747 and Concorde.
Unlike the supersonic Concorde, however, whose claim to fame was how fast it crossed the Atlantic, this latest fruit of European aerospace cooperation will ultimately be judged on how fast it makes money.
With a whisper more than a roar, the largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380, took off on its maiden flight Wednesday.
The plane is Europe's newest competitor in the battle with the Boeing Co.
The airliner's four engines lifted the 421 metric ton giant aloft at about 10:29 a.m. as hundreds watched at the Blagnac airport here.
After nearly four hours, the Airbus landed at company headquarters outside the city of Toulouse in southern France.
French President Jacques Chirac immediately hailed the "total success of the first test flight of the Airbus A380."
In a statement released by his office soon after the airliner landed, Chirac said "a new page of aeronautical history has been written.It is a magnificent result for European industrial cooperation and an encouragement to pursue this path of building a Europe of innovation and progress."
In the morning, the crowds cheered as the huge double deck plane rotated skyward at its takeoff speed of about 170 miles per hour.
The plane seemed almost to hover as it lifted off and climbed.
"The takeoff went perfectly," Alain Garcia, an Airbus engineering executive, told the LCI television station in Paris.
Its comparative lack of noise was the result of demands by customers that Airbus make the plane even more quiet than it already was, a process that took six months.
The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers in three classes, but it can be expanded to 800 seats.
The plane intended to stay within 100 miles of Toulouse, in southwest France, and maintain relatively low altitudes.
Takeoff weight was 421 metric tons, compared with the current maximum takeoff weight of 560 tons.It landed at Blagnac after a flight lasting nearly four hours.
The six man test crew, dressed in orange jumpsuits, climbed into the plane at 8:40 a.m.
The A380 is about one third larger than its next largest competitor, the Boeing 747, which sold well for 35 years but is now down to only a few sales a year.
So far, Airbus has 154 firm orders for the A380, 27 of them for the freighter version.
The plane is scheduled to enter service for Singapore Airlines in the second half of 2006.
By far the largest order is for 43 of the planes by Emirates airline, based in Dubai.
No American airlines have ordered any A380s, and none is expected to do so any time soon.
This week, Air Canada said it had firm orders for 32 new Boeing jets, including 14 787s, with a list value of about $6 billion, and Air India announced plans to order 50 Boeing jets worth $6.8 billion.
Air India wants 27 of the 787s, which will carry up to 257 passengers and have a list price of $120 million, bringing total orders and commitments for the plane to 237.
The 787, which was launched a year ago, is scheduled to enter service in 2008.
Airbus says the A380 will produce half as much noise at takeoff as the 747.
Airbus also stresses the plane's fuel efficiency, claiming that a customer driving a compact car to the airport will burn more fuel per mile than the A380 requires to move one passenger 100 miles.A team of Airbus specialists has visited major airports over the p ast few years to determine how much work will be necessary to allow the A380 to use runways and terminals.
Airbus claims the cost will be relatively small despite initial reports of huge costs.
Most of those costs would be necessary anyway as airports modernize, rather than as a direct result of the A380, Airbus says.
Willie Pierre Dupont, the Airbus director of infrastructure and environment, said he and his team had visited the 60 airports worldwide where the A380 might land, and have found that it will be easier than most airports originally thought to accommodate the A380.
Most A380 traffic will go into just 25 of those airports, Dupont said.
However, Airbus says that in the next 20 years the number of airports that could support A380 flights will grow substantially.
The superjumbo Airbus A380, the world's largest commercial airliner, took off Wednesday into cloudy skies over southwestern France for its second test flight.
The European aircraft maker, based in the French city of Toulouse, said the second flight which came exactly a week after the A380's highly anticipated maiden voyage would last about four hours.
As opposed to the international media hype that surrounded last week's flight, with hundreds of journalists on site to capture the historic moment, Airbus chose to conduct Wednesday's test more discreetly.
"This second test flight is part of a program of tests that will intensify from here on out, and we're not gonig to make statements on each phase of the program," Airbus said.
A third flight is planned for later this week, probably on Saturday, followed by three flights next week, a company source told AFP.
According to the source, Wednesday's flight may be at an altitude slightly higher than the some 10000 feet (3000 meters) achieved in the first flight, and could climb up to 13000 feet.
The double decker airliner, capable of carrying up to 800 passengers, is a key factor in Airbus's battle with US aircraft maker Boeing for market dominance.
One problem that Airbus is encountering with its new A380 is that the craft pushes the envelope on the maximum size of a commercial airplane.
International airport standards call for no plane to exceed 80 meters in length and width.
The A380 has a wingspan of 79.8 meters (262 feet).
The new plane is so much larger than any other craft that most airports face the daunting prospect of making design changes to accommodate it.
Six airlines plan to put Los Angeles International on their first flight routes for the A380.
Carriers are worried that the airport may not have enough gates for the plane, although airport officials said they were committed to having at least two A380 gates next year.
At the moment, if two A380s tried to park side by side at Los Angeles' existing gates, their wings would touch.
San Francisco International Airport has redesigned an existing terminal to accommodate the A380s, hoping to lure flights away from Los Angeles.
If major airports are slow to support the new plane, airlines may hesitate to buy more A380s.
Airbus says it needs to sell 250 planes to break even, some analysts believe the company must sell 325 to cover its investment.
The Airbus A380 has passed its emergency evacuation test, the European aircraft maker announced Wednesday, an important step toward the superjumbo's official certification for commercial flights.
Both the European Aviation and Safety Agency and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approved the A380's performance in an emergency evacuation drill conducted in a darkened aircraft hangar Sunday with 853 volunteers and 20 on board staff.
One volunteer broke a leg and about 30 others sustained minor injuries during the drill in Hamburg, Germany, when all 873 participants evacuated the plane in under 80 seconds, using only eight of its 16 exits.
Airbus Chief Operating Officer Charles Champion said in a statement that the A380 had "passed a major milestone on the road to certification."
Airbus aims to deliver the first two superjumbos to its launch customer Singapore Airlines by the end of this year about six months behind the original production schedule.
The Toulouse, France based jetmaker is majority owned by European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co.
Thirty three people were injured Sunday as they took part in a simulated emergency on Airbus' new A380 jetliner.
The company said one man broke his leg and 32 other people suffered minor injuries during the exercise in which 853 passengers and 20 crew exited the plane on slides in a darkened hangar.
Some of the injured suffered friction burns from sliding down the escape ramps, Airbus spokesman Tore Prang said.
Despite the injuries, Airbus said the plane passed its test, with everybody out of the super jumbo in about 80 seconds.
"That was a very great success," Airbus manager Gustav Humbert said after the test at its factory in the north German city of Hamburg.
The company had said that bringing 650 people out of the plane within 90 seconds would have been enough to meet safety requirements.
Construction problems have delayed the introduction of the double deck A380, the largest passenger plane in the world.
So far, 16 customers have ordered 159 of the planes, and the first examples are to go to Singapore Airlines at the end of the year.
Of the plane's 16 exits, just eight were used in the drill, which was mandatory in order for the A380 to receive its safety certification, Prang said.
Though the simulation was conducted inside a hangar, he said Airbus sought to make it as realistic as possible, strewing debris in the aisles.
Air safety officials were on hand to observe the simulation.
The German wing of European aircraft manufacturer Airbus on Friday denied a press report that it had delayed delivery of parts for the new superjumbo A380, which in turn had delayed the whole project.
"This is not true," said Tore Prang, a spokesman for Hamburg based Deutsche Airbus.
He added: "What we have delivered, we delivered on time."
Airbus said this week that it would be two to six months late in delivering the eagerly awaited A380 to airlines.
Prang said Airbus's management had made that announcement after analysing the production timetable for the whole project, and that no one factor could be blamed for the delay.
The newspaper International Herald Tribune reported on Friday that production problems at one of Airbus's main parts plants in Germany was at the root of the problem, rather than any safety or quality issues.
Airbus has taken 144 orders and 10 options from 15 airlines at a catalogue price of 263 286 million dollars (213.8 232.5 million euros) each.
The aircraft, the world's biggest airliner, with capacity for 550 to 840 passengers, successfully made its maiden test flight on April 27.
US aviation officials are studying the potential for turbulence generated by the new Airbus A380 superjumbo jet that might require special safety regulations, an agency spokeswoman said Wednesday.
Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Laura Brown said the agency is reviewing the question of turbulence generated by the jet capable of carrying 800 passengers.
Brown said that while nothing has been decided, the agency has set up a working group to make recommendations to the International Civil Aviation Organization, the agency that oversees aviation internationally.
"There won't be any separate US standards that are set for the A380, other than the international standards decided by ICAO," Brown said.
She added that experts would make recommendations before February to the ICAO, well ahead of the launch of the European made superjumbo.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that US officials may try to require increased distances around the A380 as an added safety precaution, while noting that the issue may be clouded by transatlantic trade disputes over aviation subsidies.
The first A380 aircraft are expected to be delivered in late 2006 as the European consortium tries to capture a niche for high capacity, long range aircraft with a plane much larger than Boeing 747, currently the largest passenger jet on the market.
An Airbus spokesman in France said the company has begun to measure turbulence in the wake of the A380 but that studies are not complete.
"The bigger the aircraft, the heavier it is and thus it is logical that turbulence could be more significant," the Airbus spokesman said, while adding that the maker has designed the plane "to minimize this effect."
Airbus will pay millions of dollars in compensation to airlines hit by delays in delivery of the European plane maker's new A380 superjumbo, a senior executive said Sunday.
Airbus chief operating officer John Leahy refused to give specific details of compensation.
"The airplane costs about US$285 million (euro243.65 million) a copy, so I think it is safe to say we are talking a couple of million dollars," Leahy told Australia's Nine Network.
"But let's not get into detail that's confidential between us and the customer," he added.
Qantas has ordered 12 of the A380 jets and is in negotiations for compensation after their delivery was shunted back by about six months to April 2007.
Singapore Airlines, which has ordered 10 of the jets, has complained about an eight month delay in delivery to November 2006 and Malaysia Airlines, which has ordered six planes, also is unhappy with the postponement.
Qantas executive general manager John Borghetti gave the giant jet an enthusiastic reception.
"This aircraft will do for aviation what the (Boeing) 747 did some 30 to 35 years ago," Borghetti told reporters after the landing.
"Even in economy class, every seat will be bigger, everybody will have more room," he said.
He said Qantas would have first, business and economy classes in its A380s, meaning the planes would carry just under 500 passengers.
Leahy said Airbus already is close to selling 250 A380s, a number that will allow the company to break even on its development costs.
"We are essentially there now," he said.
"We have 159 firm orders and I have got about 100 options that are blocking delivery slots, most of them over the next five years," he said.
Leahy was speaking as an A380, the world's largest passenger jet, flew low over Sydney Harbour on the second leg of its three city tour of Australia.
The Airbus A380 flew over the harbor and its famous bridge and opera house before touching down at Sydney Airport.
The giant plane was decked out in Qantas markings along its side but still carried the Airbus logo on its tail.
On Saturday, thousands of spectators turned out to watch the A380 touched down in Australia for the first time at Brisbane Airport after an overnight flight from Singapore, where it arrived Friday on the first leg of an Asian tour to woo new customers.
The white jet, as tall as a seven story building and stretching about three quarters of the length of a soccer field, is designed to carry 555 passengers but can be stretched to accommodate 800, Airbus says.
By 2006, 20 airports will be ready for the A380 including Singapore, Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Sydney, Paris, Dubai and New York.
By 2008, 38 airports will be ready and 60 by 2010, Airbus said in a statement.
Six other carriers in the region have ordered A380s.
The 49 Asian and Australian orders make up 31 percent of 159 firm orders for the superjumbos.
The A380 prototype was originally due to arrive Tuesday in Singapore but Airbus postponed the trip to replace two of the plane's four engines.
The plane that arrived in Sydney was to fly to the southern city of Melbourne on Monday before returning to Brisbane to be the center point of 85th birthday celebrations for Qantas.
It was to depart for Asia on Wednesday.
Airbus said Wednesday it was up to six months behind schedule in delivering its new superjumbo A380 aircraft to airlines due to production problems, a delay that could entail financial penalties.
The European aircraft maker said that A380 deliveries to customers would be pushed back by two to six months after Australia's Qantas Airways announced its order of 12 A380s has been delayed for at least six months.
Qantas head Geoff Dixon said that the first of the 12 superjumbo aircraft ordered by the airline had been delayed from October 2006 to April 2007, and said that his company would seek damages in accordance with terms in its contract.
Airbus declined to comment on financial penalty clauses in its contracts.
Airbus spokeswoman Barbara Kracht told AFP that the airliners would be delivered with a delay of "two to six months depending on the case".
"We are in the process of reviewing the timetable.
We are informing all of our customers," she added.
Airbus has taken 144 orders and 10 options from 15 airlines at a catalogue price of 263 286 million dollars (213.8 232.5 euros) each.
The aircraft, the world's biggest airliner, with capacity for 550 to 840 passengers, successfully made its maiden test flight on April 27.
Shortly after the first flight, Airbus warned Singapore Airlines, the first carrier scheduled for A380 deliveries, that they had been pushed back to the second half of 2006 from the first half.
Singapore Airlines has ordered 10 A380s with an option for another 15.
Airbus said Wednesday the delays were due to production problems linked to the cabin fittings demanded by the different clients.
"The first 15 planes to produce are completely different, one from another," an Airbus spokesman said.
A source close to Airbus suppliers said: "The interior fittings are posing some problems, notably the installation of new entertainment systems."
Emirates Airlines chief executive Tim Clark said that any delay of more than six months in the delivery schedule for the Airbus A380 would be a "serious issue".
Emirates is the the biggest customer of the A380 with an order for 43 planes, and has been expecting to take delivery of the aircraft in October 2006.
In a statement received in Paris, Clark said he expected to receive word on the delivery schedule in the next one to two weeks, and added that if the expected delay is restricted to a few months, then that "is not a huge problem for Emirates if it is known in advance".
But, "a six to 12 month delay would be a serious issue for the carrier,because it would substantially slow down Emirates' ambitious growth plans," Clark said, according to the statement.
Air France KLM said Airbus had warned it of a delay in A380 deliveries, but added that the companies had yet to confirm a revised delivery schedule.
Air France is due to take its first delivery of an A380 in April 2007.
It has made a firm order for 10 A380s, with an option for four others.
German flag carrier Lufthansa, meanwhile, said delays in the delivery of its 15 A380s were "possible" but the company has not yet received any notification from Airbus on this matter.
"We have not yet received a delivery schedule from Airbus," a spokesman said.
He said that Lufthansa's contract with Airbus includes arrangements for financial penalties in case of delayed deliveries, but declined to give details.
Asked whether the company would make use of this clause, he said: "Why do you think we have this clause?"
Lufthansa expects the first of its superjumbos to arrive in autumn 2007.
The European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company owns 80 percent of Airbus, which generates most of its sales.
The other 20 percent is held by British group BAE Systems.
Shares in EADS plunged sharply on news of the delay, but later recouped much of their losses as investors cheered a lucrative military contract.
EADS closed 0.25 percent lower at 23.97 euros after its joint venture MEADS International announced it had signed a 3.2 billion dollar contract for the Medium Extended Air Defense System for the US, German and Italian armed forces.
European aircraft manufacturer Airbus is confident of obtaining certification for its double decker A380 airliner despite the failure of a wing during stress testing, a company official said Wednesday.
"Tests were rather good.
We are confident the test will prove satisfactory to obtain the certification at the end of the year," said Charles Champion, director of the program.
Singapore Airlines is scheduled to receive its first A380s in November when it becomes the first carrier to fly the biggest commercial airliner ever built.
Airbus has previously said the new A380 would still enter service later this year despite the fact that a wing fractured during ground testing in France last week.
All new models of commercial aircraft are subjected to testing, including being able to withstand 1.5 times the maximum strain that parts of the plane would be subjected to in extreme conditions like a hard landing.
The A380 wing was about three percent from the target when the wing ruptured.
"We aren't even sure we need to reinforce the structure.
Probably we won't.
If we do, we are talking about a few kilos (pounds)," Champion said on the sidelines of a news conference during Asian Aerospace, the world's third largest airshow.
A second Airbus A380 took off on its maiden flight Tuesday, stepping up the "superjumbo" flight test program a year before the world's largest passenger plane is due to enter service.
Almost six months after the first A380 test flight, which drew tens of thousands of spectators, the second plane took off from Toulouse, southern France, in light rain.
Fitted out with heavy test instrumentation, the second A380 will test its four Rolls Royce Trent 900 engines as well as systems and materials.
Three more test planes will later join the program, evaluating cabin comfort, noise levels and the plane's alternative Engine Alliance GP7200 engines.
Airbus so far has 159 orders for the A380 from 16 customers, but launch customer Singapore Airlines Ltd. and some others have expressed frustration at program delays.
Singapore, which had initially been scheduled to take delivery in March, is now set to receive its planes from "late 2006," Airbus said Tuesday.
With a list price of US$292 million (euro243 million), Airbus says its A380 passenger version will fly 555 people seated in a three class configuration over 5600 nautical miles (10400 kilometers).
The European aircraft manufacturer Airbus cannot produce enough of its A380 superjumbos to satisfy heavy demand, its commercial director said on Saturday.
"I could sell another 30 A380s between now and 2010 if we had the production capacity," John Leahy told German Sunday newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, Airbus said on Saturday.
The European producer has taken 149 firm orders and 10 options from 16 clients for the A380, the largest commercial plane made yet.
The superjumbo, which can seat between 555 and 840 passengers, made its successful maiden test flight on April 27 and will fly its first long haul test run to Asia and Australia next month.
In June, Airbus raised the aircraft's catalogue price by 10 million dollars to an average of 292 million dollars (242 million euros).
Singapore Airlines will be the first to receive the new model, with the first orders delivered in late 2006, following earlier production delays.
With Airbus and rival US manufacturer Boeing locked in a transatlantic trade dispute over aviation subsidies, the French government has criticised as unreasonable a US safety review of the A380, which could recommend greater distances around the super jumbo for fear of slipstream turbulence.
The Airbus A380 superjumbo will enter service later this year as scheduled despite the rupture of a wing during ground tests, the European aircraft maker said Friday.
Airbus spokeswoman Barbara Kracht said the wings of the 555 seater may require "refinements at certain points" as a result of the fracture, which happened Tuesday during ground testing in Toulouse.
"It should have no impact on the certification and delivery," Kracht said.
Before certifying an airliner for commercial service, aviation authorities set its "limit loads" the maximum strain each part is likely to be placed under during extreme turbulence or hard landings.
New planes are required to resist loads of 1.5 times the limit.
The A380 wing had been bent upward by 7.4 meters (24.3 feet) at the tip, reaching 1.45 times its limit load or 3.3 percent short of target when the rupture appeared in a section between the two engines, Kracht said.
Airbus engineers and officials from the European Aviation Safety Agency and U.S. Federal Aviation Administration will decide what if any modifications are required, she said.
"We will need to find out from the data what is really needed, but it's certainly not a redesign of the wing."
The A380 is due to enter into service with Singapore Airlines Ltd. by the end of the year already six months behind its original schedule.
Shares in Airbus parent European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co. opened 1.2 percent lower Friday on Euronext, but had recovered to euro31.58 (US$37.45) by early afternoon, up 1.5 percent.
A group of Turkish writers, academics, journalists and artists called on the government Monday to scrap laws that limit freedom of expression, including one under which the country's most famous novelist has been charged.
EU officials have harshly criticized such laws and a group of 169 intellectuals issued a statement, saying they viewed Orhan Pamuk's trial as "a grave interference in our country's democratization process."
The group, which includes novelist Yasar Kemal and pianist Fazil Say, said the government should do away with the law that makes it a crime to insult the Turkish republic, "Turkishness" or state institutions, which was used against Pamuk.
Pamuk was charged with insulting the country after telling a Swiss newspaper in February that "30000 Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands, and nobody but me dares to talk about it."
Earlier this month, a group of observers from the European Parliament attending Pamuk's trial demanded that Turkey change the article used against Pamuk or risk putting its EU bid in jeopardy.
The next hearing is scheduled for Feb 7.
Pamuk's remarks highlighted two of the most painful episodes in Turkish history: the massacre of Armenians during World War I which Turkey insists was not a planned genocide and recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey's overwhelmingly Kurdish southeast.
An Istanbul court has dropped charges against prominent author Orhan Pamuk, who was accused of "denigrating the Turkish national identity" over remarks he made about the mass killings of Armenians during World War I, CNN Turk television reported Sunday.
The trial of Pamuk, Turkey's most famous writer, which began last month, had been adjourned pending a decision by the justice ministry, whose authorization was needed to continue the case.
CNN Turk said the ministry had declared in a letter to the tribunal that it was legally not competent to judge whether the case should go on, and the court had thus decided to dismiss the case.
When contacted by AFP, a justice minitry official declined any immediate comment on news of the court's decision but said the ministry would address the issue on Monday.
Pamuk, who has won several international literary prizes, risked up to three years in prison for remarks made during an interview published in a Swiss magazine last February.
"One million Armenians and 30000 Kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it," he told Das Magazin in February.
Turkey categorically denies Armenian accusations that up to 1.5 million of their kinsmen died in a genocide orchestrated by the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1917.
The case against Pamuk, praised by Turkish nationalists, drew condemnations from the European Union, which warned it was a test of freedom of speech in Turkey.
Some EU lawmakers who attended the December hearing said the trial could affect the country's aspirations to join the bloc.
Pamuk's lawyer could not be reached to confirm the television report.
The trial had been set to resume on February 7.
A Turkish court dropped charges of "insulting Turkishness" Monday against internationally acclaimed novelist Orhan Pamuk, ending a trial that outraged even the most passionate advocates of Turkey's EU membership bid by raising questions about the nation's commitment to freedom of speech.
Coming just days before the EU is to begin a review of Turkey's much criticized justice system, the court decision was a sign that the long desired goal of joining the wealthy EU was slowly forcing the government to embrace European norms of freedom and democracy.
"The court dropped the case," Haluk Inanici, the author's lawyer, told the AP by telephone.
"This case should not have been opened in the first place."
Olli Rehn, EU enlargement commissioner said in a statement that the decision to dismiss charges was "good news for freedom of expression in Turkey" but warned that Turkey "needs to fill properly the loopholes" in its penal code, which he said limit freedom of expression.
The author of critically acclaimed books including "My Name is Red," "Snow" and "Istanbul," had faced up to three years in prison for telling a Swiss newspaper in February: "Thirty thousand Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands, and nobody but me dares to talk about it."
The remark was taken as an insult to Turkey, and a prosecutor opened a case against the oft mentioned candidate for the Nobel Prize under article 301 of the new penal code, which sets penalties for insults against the Turkish Republic or "Turkishness."
Turkey is still not off the hook, however, as dozens of people are still facing charges similar to Pamuk's.
The nationalist lawyers behind the charges have vowed to continue prosecuting those who allegedly break the law by insulting Turkey.
Kemal Kerincsiz, a board member of the Turkish Lawyers' Union, said Monday that he would appeal the Pamuk decision.
"It is a scandal," Kerincsiz said by telephone.
"Orhan Pamuk must be punished for insulting Turkey and Turkishness, it is a grave crime and it should not be left unpunished."
European officials have repeatedly asked that Turkey change its laws to take the legal ammunition away from those who would prosecute speech offenses in Turkey.
"Pamuk is not the only case of a person prosecuted for having expressed a non violent opinion in Turkey, it's just the most high profile case," Rehn said.
Writers' advocacy group International PEN welcomed the dropping of charges but said it was not nearly enough.
"It does little to assuage PEN's concerns that the right to freedom of expression in Turkey is severely curtailed by the existence of laws that penalize debate on "taboo" topics," PEN said in a written statement.
For Europeans who oppose Turkey's membership in their club of democracies, the prosecution of Pamuk reinforced the view that the nation of 70 million Muslims, while a useful buffer between Europe and the Middle East, is no part of contemporary European civilization.
The case also divided Turkey and embarrassed the nation's liberals.
"Article 301 and others curbing freedom of expression which do not fit Turkey's democratic image must be changed," said Inanici.
The country's press organizations have accused the government of lacking the political will to change laws hindering free expression.
But Justice Minister Cemil Cicek on Friday admitted shortcomings in Turkey's judicial system and promised more legal reforms.
"Turkey is a state of law.
There are shortcomings, and we're unified in eliminating them," on the road to the EU, Cicek said.
Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul acknowledged that charges brought against Pamuk had tarnished the country's image and said for the first time that laws that limit freedom of expression may be changed.
In the opening hearing of the trial Dec 16, a judge threw the case back to the Justice Ministry, demanding that the government first approve it.
Then last week, Cicek sent the case back to the local court, saying the ministry has no say under a new penal code.
On Monday, the Istanbul court said: "It was necessary to decide to drop the case because there was no explicit authorization for prosecution."
Cicek's move was an apparent attempt to avoid upsetting both the EU and Turkish nationalists.
But Monday's court decision will likely anger nationalists, including some within the government's conservative grass roots.
During the trial nationalists pelted Pamuk's car with eggs, shouting "Traitor!" and "Love it or leave it!" in reference to Turkey.
British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw urged Tehran on Tuesday to seriously consider Russia's offer to enrich Iran's uranium in an effort to end its nuclear standoff with countries that want to refer it to the U.N. Security Council.
But Straw also said in an interview with The Associated Press that he hoped the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, would decide during its Feb 2 3 emergency meeting to refer the nuclear standoff to the U.N. Security Council.
Straw said the European allies were open to resuming talks with Iran, if it suspends uranium enrichment activities.
He urged the country's leaders to "look much more seriously" at a compromise proposal offered by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Putin has offered to allow uranium enrichment for Iran to be conducted in Russia where it could be supervised.
Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, was meeting Tuesday with Russian officials in Moscow, a day after Tehran warned that a referral to the U.N. Security Council would lead it to immediately forge ahead with a full scale uranium enrichment program.
The West fears Iran wants to develop a nuclear bomb, but Tehran says its intentions are peaceful and that it is only seeking to develop the capacity for civilian nuclear energy.
Britain, France and Germany declared after Iran's decision that their two years of talks with Tehran had reached a dead end, and they are pressing along with the United States for the issue to be referred to the U.N. Security Council which has the power to impose sanctions.
Straw said Tuesday that talks about Iran would continue right up to the IAEA decision.
"At each stage up to now there's been a high level of speculation in advance of meetings of the IAEA," Straw said as he flew from London to Cyprus on a three day trip including scheduled stops in Greece and Turkey.
In each case, "a satisfactory conclusion has been reached within an unsatisfactory situation.
So I hope that that's where we'll get to,But each of these negotiations has gone to the wire.
I don't think this one will be any different," he said.
Straw also praised a Turkish court's decision Monday to drop charges of "insulting Turkishness" against international acclaimed novelist Orhan Pamuk, but said the country still needs to boost human rights as it works toward hoped for membership in the European Union.
"They've still got quite a long way to go, and they know, they don't need me to tell them that decisions like the one to arrest the novelist Orhan Pamuk don't help.
I'm glad they decided apparently ,not to pursue it," Straw said.
"What we want to see is a situation where the laws that apply in Turkey ,are the same as those which apply elsewhere in the European Union."
Pamuk's trial had outraged even those favoring Turkey's membership bid by raising questions about its commitment to freedom of speech.
Dozens of people still face similar charges, though, and the EU is about to begin a review of Turkey's much criticized justice system.
Straw said Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan had already made impressive changes, but that the reality of the rights situation didn't always keep up with his legislative reforms.
He declined to comment on allegations by Russia's intelligence agency that four British diplomats in Moscow were involved in espionage, or to say how the charges might affect ties between London and Moscow.
"We've got good relations with the government of Russia," he said.
"Relations will continue."
Straw is trying to build new support for a stalled Cyprus peace plan in a visit to the divided island.
Cyprus' president has refused to see Straw to protest the foreign secretary's planned meeting with the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mehmet Ali Talat, on Wednesday.
"I regret the decision ,but it can't deflect me from the purpose of my visit," Straw said.
He hopes to learn whether the two sides are open to refocusing on U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's settlement plan for the war torn island, which was approved by Turkish Cypriots but rejected by Greek Cypriots in separate referendums in 2004, only days before the island joined the European Union.
He said he wasn't expecting major progress any time soon.
"What I'm very anxious to ensure is that we don't see movement backwards," he said.
The Turkish Justice Ministry on Sunday declined to rule on whether a criminal trial of the novelist Orhan Pamuk on a charge of insulting "Turkishness" should proceed.
The Justice Ministry's action sent the case back to an Istanbul court, which in December had postponed the trial, saying that it was up to the government to decide whether to proceed with the case.
Turkey has come under heavy criticism from international human rights groups and governments.
As the country is considered for European Union membership, the trial is seen as a test of its commitment to freedom of expression.
The Justice Ministry on Sunday cited amendments made to the penal code last year in saying that the court should determine whether to proceed, the semiofficial Anatolian news agency reported.
Some television networks here reported that the Istanbul court had already dropped charges against the novelist following the ministry statement, but there was no confirmation of those reports.
The European Union welcomed a Turkish court decision Monday to drop charges against well known novelist Orhan Pamuk, but warned Ankara that it must address legal loopholes that limit freedom of speech in other cases.
Olli Rehn, the EU commissioner in charge of expansion, said the decision to drop the case against Pamuk was "good news for freedom of expression in Turkey," but said Turkey "needs to fill properly the loopholes" in its penal code.
"Pamuk is not the only case of a person prosecuted for having expressed a non violent opinion in Turkey, it's just the most high profile case," Rehn said.
"Several journalists, editors, writers and academics still face similar charges today.
I hope therefore that the decision on Orhan Pamuk's case will pave the way for a positive outcome for them as well, so that freedom of expression for all Turkish citizens is fully respected."
The Pamuk case became the focus of critics against the 25 nation bloc opening entry talks with Turkey last October.
In its progress report on Turkey last year, the European Commission also called on Ankara to ensure its penal code reforms were implemented to ensure democratic freedoms were protected in its court system.
Rehn said the current judicial laws "leave too much room for abusive and restrictive interpretations limiting freedom of expression."
Pamuk went on trial for telling a Swiss newspaper in February that Turkey is unwilling to deal with two of the most painful episodes in recent Turkish history: the massacre of Armenians during World War I, which Turkey insists was not a planned genocide, and recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey's overwhelmingly Kurdish southeast.
An Istanbul court dropped charges against the novelist Orhan Pamuk on Monday, ending a trial that put Turkey at odds with the European Union over the issue of freedom of speech.
Pamuk, whose works have been translated into dozens of languages, spoke in a newspaper interview about the mass killings of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire in 1915, and also of the deaths of Kurds in Turkish operations in the 1980s against a separatist group.
He was then prosecuted for "insulting Turkish identity."
The subject of the 1915 massacres remains taboo in Turkey.
The court had asked the government to rule on whether to proceed with the case.
On Sunday, the Justice Ministry told the court to make the decision, citing changes made to the penal code last year.
On Monday the court dropped the charges.
The ruling was immediately welcomed by the European legislators.
However the lawyer for the novelist, Haluk Inanici, chided the court for framing its decision in bureaucratic terms rather than addressing the issue of freedom of expression.
"The court dropped the charges not because the trial violated the freedom of speech," he said, but because "there was a missing approval by the Justice Ministry to proceed with the trial."
Pamuk was facing a sentence of up to three years in jail if he was convicted of insulting the Turkish identity in the interview he gave to Das Magazine, a Swiss publication, in 2005.
Pamuk's high profile abroad, in Europe and elsewhere, prompted widespread opposition to his prosecution, an advantage that many intellectuals who face similar charges do not have, said Vecdi Sayar, general secretary of International PEN, a worldwide association of writers.
PEN says that about 70 intellectuals have been charged under Article 301 of the revised penal code, which calls for punishment for public comments that "denigrate Turkishness, the government, the army and the memory of the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk."
"There are many people abroad who fail to see beyond Orhan Pamuk's trial," Sayar said.
"Saving a writer like Orhan Pamuk from prosecution may stand as a symbolic example on its own.
But it is not an overall resolution for other intellectuals and writers that still face similar charges in Turkey."
Turkey's justice minister has left a critical decision on whether to drop charges against novelist Orhan Pamuk to a local Istanbul court, according to officials, in an apparent attempt to avoid outraging Europe by allowing a renowned author to stand trial for his views or angering nationalists by dropping the case.
Justice Minister Cemil Cicek's decision came at a delicate time for European Union aspirant Turkey.
This week, the EU is to begin a review of the country's justice system.
The high profile trial has already outraged European Union officials and sparked questions over the country's commitment to free speech.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government has made joining the EU a cornerstone of its policy and passed sweeping reforms of Turkey's legal code.
On Oct 3, Turkey realized one of its dreams when the EU agreed to open membership talks with the overwhelmingly Muslim country.
The government apparently did not want to risk a face off with the EU over the sensitive case.
The local court which halted the trial of Pamuk on Dec 16, the day it began had asked the ministry whether it should continue with the case.
The local court could now drop the charges against Pamuk, based on a technicality, saying the Justice Ministry's consent is missing from the file.
Cicek, however, reiterated to the court that his ministry has no say in the matter under the new penal code passed in June, a senior Justice Ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
"The authority in this issue belongs to (the justice system)," the state owned Anatolia news agency on Sunday quoted Cicek as telling the court in his written response.
Cicek's response was sent to the court on Friday.
It was not clear when the court would issue its decision.
The next hearing is on Feb 7.
The local court had argued that it cannot continue the trial since there was no approval from the justice ministry to try Pamuk for his remarks which predate the June reform.
Cicek insisted that the amendments in the penal code in June has lifted the ministry's say over the case.
Such a decision could still outrage nationalists who pelted Pamuk's car with eggs, shouting "Traitor!" and "Love it or leave it!" in reference to Turkey during the opening hearing on Dec 16.
Pamuk was charged under a law that makes insulting Turkey a crime after a Swiss newspaper in February quoted him as saying: "30000 Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands, and nobody but me dares to talk about it."
Pamuk's remarks referred to two of the most painful episodes in recent Turkish history: The massacre of Armenians during World War I, which Turkey insists was not a planned genocide, and recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey's overwhelmingly Kurdish southeast.
Pamuk, author of "Snow" and "My Name is Red" and an often mentioned candidate for the Nobel prize in literature, said in a brief statement to the press after the trial that "it is not good for Turkey, for our democracy, for such freedom of expression cases to be prolonged."
Turkey has for years come under severe EU criticism for laws that stifle freedom of speech.
The nation has carried out a sweeping series of reforms to expand freedom of expression as part of its EU membership drive, but nationalist prosecutors and judges often still interpret laws in a restrictive manner.
A Turkish court has dropped charges against renowned novelist Orhan Pamuk for insulting the Turkish identity, local newspaper HURRIYET (Freedom) reported on Monday.
Pamuk's lawyer has confirmed the dismissal of the case.
The Istanbul court's decision came after the Justice Ministry said that the court had no authority to try him.
The court had adjourned Pamuk's trial shortly after it began on Dec 16 and asked the Justice Ministry for a legal opinion on whether he could be tried under a new penal code.
Best selling novelist Pamuk, 53, was charged with insulting the Turkish identity by saying that nobody in Turkey dared mention the killing of a million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire during World War I.
The case has catched international limelight and the European Union has voiced grave concerns over it.
The EU started talks with Ankara on its entry bid in October.
The negotiations are expected to last at least a decade and the EU demands Turkey to carry out wide ranging reforms.
Turkey has rejected allegations of genocide against Armenians during World War I.
EU enlargement chief Olli Rehn hailed Monday a Turkish decision to drop charges against prominent author Orhan Pamuk, but pressed Ankara over similar cases and urged the country to review its law.
"This is obviously good news for Mr Pamuk, but it's also good news for freedom of expression in Turkey," Rehn said in a statement.
Pamuk had been charged with insulting the Turkish nation in remarks on the mass killings of Armenians during World War One.
The case has attracted huge international attention and cast a pall on Turkey's commitment to free speech at a time when the EU is closely monitoring the membership candidate's adherence to democratic values.
Rehn said he hoped the developments in Pamuk's case would help ease the plight of other writers and intellectuals being persecuted in Turkey.
"Several journalists, editors, writers and academics still face similar charges today," he said.
"I hope therefore that the decision on Orhan Pamuk's case will pave the way for a positive outcome for them as well, so that freedom of expression for all Turkish citizens is fully respected."
And he warned: "It is clear for me that Turkey needs to fill properly the loopholes of the current Penal Code, which leave too much room for abusive and restrictive interpretations limiting freedom of expression."
Pamuk, 53, risked six months to three years in jail for "denigrating the Turkish national identity" in remarks published in a Swiss magazine concerning the Armenian massacres of 1915 17.
"One million Armenians and 30000 Kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it," Pamuk told Das Magazin in February.
Turkey categorically denies Armenian accusations that up to 1.5 million of their kinsmen died in a genocide orchestrated by the Ottoman Empire in the last years of its existence.
Pamuk, Turkey's best selling writer, is the author of internationally renowned works such as "My Name is Red" and "Snow" and winner of a number of literary awards.
BERLIN The European Union official overseeing Turkey's admission to the 25 nation bloc warned Thursday that Turkey's prosecution of a bestselling author for insulting "Turkishness" could damage the country's chances of joining the EU.
"It is not Orhan Pamuk who will stand trial, but Turkey," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said in an unusually blunt statement released in Brussels.
"This is a litmus test of whether Turkey is seriously committed to freedom of expression and to reforms that enhance the rule of law."
Pamuk, 53, Turkey's best known novelist, is expected to go on trial Friday for stating in a Swiss magazine interview what most historians regard as unassailable facts: That some 1 million Armenians were slaughtered by Turks in the 1915 1918 genocide and that thousands of ethnic Kurds have lost their lives in more recent civil strife in modern Turkey.
The case has stirred outrage across Europe, where there is deepening opposition to allowing Turkey whose population is largely Muslim and whose landmass lies almost entirely in Asia to join an economic and political confederation whose most basic membership requirement is a commitment to democracy and to such values as freedom of speech.
Membership is considered vital to Turkey's economic future.
The admission process is expected to take years.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is among the European leaders opposed to granting admission to Turkey, partly because of the country's poor human rights record and wavering attitudes toward democratic principles, including the idea that citizens have a right to criticize the government and national institutions.
Such activist organizations as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have criticized Turkey for bringing criminal charges against Pamuk and dozens of other writers and scholars for allegedly defaming "Turkishness and Turkish national institutions," usually for making public remarks about historical events considered strictly taboo.
The cases, brought by prosecutors, come even as the government in Ankara has proclaimed a greater dedication to individual freedoms in its effort to join the European Union.
"From the world renowned poet Nazin Hikmet in the 1930s to Orhan Pamuk today, Turkish judges have prosecuted and imprisoned the country's greatest writers," Holly Cartner, director for Europe and Central Asia for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement from Istanbul.
"A Turkish judge has to make a truly strong declaration to prove those days are over."
But prosecutors appeared determined to press ahead with a high profile prosecution despite the international uproar and despite the warnings from Europe.
Rehn's statements marked the first time that the EU has unequivocally linked Turkey's hopes for EU membership to an attack on free speech that has drawn criticism across the Western world.
"The trial of a novelist who expressed a nonviolent opinion casts a shadow over the accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU," said Rehn, who is Finnish.
"Considering the number of recent prosecutions, it appears that Turkey's new penal code does not provide sufficient protection for freedom of expression."
Pamuk, author of such highly praised bestsellers as "Snow" and "My Name is Red," has had his works translated into 30 languages.
At least 60 other Turkish writers, scholars, and publishers presently face charges under Turkey's recently revised "Article 301," according to Amnesty International.
Among other things, the modified penal code makes it a criminal offense to criticize "Turkishness," national institutions, or the founder of the republic, Mustafa Kemal known as "Ataturk."
If convicted, Pamuk faces up to three years behind bars, although most analysts believe it extremely unlikely he will be imprisoned if found guilty in Sisly Primary Court No. 2 in Istanbul.
But a guilty verdict even one accompanied by a paltry fine would send a shocking message to European nations watching closely as Turkey strives to modernize both its political system and its economy.
"Pamuk's conviction or a postponement of his trial would signal a serious reverse to recent reforms in Turkey," Cartner said.
Charges were brought against Pamuk after he angered Turkish nationalists, fundamentalist Muslims, and many ordinary Turks by saying in a February interview with Switzerland's Das Magazin weekly that "thirty thousand Kurds and one million Armenians were killed in these lands."
Although few historians doubt that hundreds of thousands of Armenians were killed in Turkey, discussion of the topic remains largely off limits in Turkey and the government denies that such a genocide occurred.
The taboo was lifted slightly this year when Istanbul's Bilgi University hosted a cautious conference on the "Armenian question" a gathering that triggered angry protests.
"What happened to the Ottoman Armenians in 1915 was a major thing that was hidden from the Turkish nation it was a taboo," Pamuk told the BBC.
"But we have to be able to talk about the past."
Pamuk's other allusion was to the killing of thousands of ethnic Kurds during clashes between Turkish armed forces and Kurdish insurgents in the 1980s and 1990s.
The exact numbers of casualties remain unclear, and many Turkish civilians also died at the hands of avowed Kurdish "freedom fighters," but there is no doubt many innocent lives were lost.
Many Turks, however, believe that Pamuk insulted the nation.
"He overstepped the mark," nationalist organizer Kemal Kerincsiz told Turkish reporters.
"Orhan Pamuk should not have played with history, and with the sentiments of Turks."
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan defended Saturday author Orhan Pamuk's right to free speech, but rejected European Union pressure on Ankara to halt the controversial trial of the internationally renowned novelist.
"My stance on freedom of thought is clear because I myself have become a victim (of restrictions) in this context," Erdogan was quoted as saying by Anatolia news agency in the central city of Konya.
He said, however, that the EU, which sees Pamuk's trial as a test for Turkey's commitment to democracy and human rights, "is trying to put our judiciary under pressure," Anatolia reported.
"This is wrong," Erdogan said.
"Either right or wrong, the case is now before the justice,Let's see the outcome and then make comments."
Pamuk, Turkey's best known writer and winner of many international awards, appeared before court in Istanbul Friday on charges of denigrating Turkish national identity for telling a Swiss magazine that "one million Armenians and 30000 Kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it."
The case was adjourned to February to await a decision by the justice ministry, whose authorization is needed to proceed with the trial.
European Parliament members, who attended the hearing, criticized the government for having squandered the opportunity to demonstrate its respect for freedom of speech by failing to halt the trial.
Turkey began membership talks on October 4, but critics say the country has yet to fully embrace the EU's democarcy norms despite the far reaching reforms it has already undertaken.
Erdogan has defended freedom of speech citing his own conviction for "inciting religious hatred" by reciting a poem with Islamic messages during a political rally in 1997, which earned him a four month stint in prison.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul called on the EU not to judge Turkey's record by a single case.
"Let's not be unfair towards Turkey," he told the Sabah daily.
"There is no conviction (in the Pamuk case) yet.
There is no one in jail in Turkey because of (exercising) freedom of expression."
Gul pledged more efforts to ensure that the reforms Turkey undertook to boost its EU bid are properly implemented on the ground.
"It's our duty to strengthen the reform process," he said.
"The changes adopted so far are not cosmetic, but there is still more to be done."
Erdogan said he had also asked the interior minister to investigate the apparent security lapses at Friday's trial, which was marred by nationalist militants heaping abuse on the writer and foreign observers.
Slogans accusing Pamuk of being a "traitor" followed him to the courtroom, and along the way a woman hit him on the head with a file.
His car was pelted with eggs as he left.
British parliamentarian Denis MacShane, a former Europe minister, said he had been punched in the face by a hostile lawyer inside the courthouse.
Erdogan denounced the scenes as "ugliness" and said the police had committed "a serious mistake" by allowing such incidents.
The Turkish press accused the authorities of damaging Turkey's image by failing both to stop the trial and to ensure security at the hearing.
"Orhan Pamuk's trial and the scenes at the courthouse leave me with the impression that some people within the state favour such incidents in order to undermine (Turkey's) EU membership bid," a Sabah columnist wrote.
Outspoken Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk has said he stands by his controversial remarks about the killing of Armenians and Kurds, for which he could face imprisonment in Turkey.
Pamuk, who is to go on trial in Turkey on Dec 16 on charges of insulting his country's national character, is this year's recipient of the German Book Trade's annual Peace Prize.
"I repeat, I said loud and clear that 1 million Armenians and 30000 Kurds were killed in Turkey," he told reporters Saturday at the Frankfurt Book Fair.
"And I stand by that."
However, he reiterated that he had not used the term genocide in reference to the killings.
"Whether it should be called genocide or mass murder or something else, must be decided upon by experts," the 53 year old writer said.
Controversy has surrounded Pamuk since he told a Swiss newspaper in February that "30000 Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares to talk about it."
He was referring to Kurds killed over the past two decades during Turkey's conflict with autonomy seeking Kurdish guerrillas, branded as a terrorist group by the U.S. and European Union, and to Armenians killed around the time of World War I. Armenians and several country's recognize those killings as the first genocide of the 20th century, which Turkey vehemently denies.
Turkish prosecutors filed charges against Pamuk and he goes to court on Dec 16.
If convicted, he could be sentenced to as long as three years in prison.
The United States and the European Union have called on Turkey to drop the charges to ensure freedom of expression.
Organizers of the Frankfurt Book Fair said they awarded the prize to Pamuk in honor of his advocating freedom of speech and promoting understanding through his literature.
"The award for Orhan Pamuk honors a writer who, unlike any other author of our time, pursues the historic traces of the West in the East and the East in the West, dedicated to a concept of culture that is based entirely on knowledge of and respect for the person who is different," the organizers said.
He will formally receive the prize on Sunday.
Pamuk, who has written several notable works, including "Sessiz Ev," "The White Castle," "My Name is Red" and "Snow," said he welcomed the prize, which includes euro25000 (US$30000).
He is the second Turk to receive the prize, after Yasar Kemal who was awarded the same prize in 1997.
He said several European writers had influenced his work.
"Dostoyevsky, Thomas Mann, Tolstoy, Proust, Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Faulkner ,they all had a great influence on me, and when I write I speak with them," he said.
"European writers have helped their countries develop and I count myself among them."
The novelist said he hoped Turkey would eventually join the 25 nation EU, noting it would provide his country with the means to improve.
"The criterion for admission for instance the equal treatment of minorities would be favorable for Turkey," he said, adding that the EU would also benefit from expanding its borders.
A Turkish court convened here Friday to try prominent Turkish author Orhan Pamuk on charges of insulting the Turkish nation, but it was not immediately clear whether the trial would proceed.
Lawmakers from the European parliament and leading Turkish intellectuals were present for the trial in which Pamuk, 53, risks six months to three years in jail.
The 53 year old author, wearing a dark business suit and tie, made his way into the cramped courtroom amid a crowd of reporters, supporters and protestors.
The court, in a ruling dated December 2, said that since the alleged offence was committed before Turkey amended its penal code earlier this year, Pamuk should be judged under the old law, which requires a direct order from the justice ministry for the trial to proceed.
Justice Minister Cemil Cicek in remarks published Friday said he had not received the prosecution file by Thursday afternoon, making it unlikely the trial would begin Friday.
Prominent Turkish author Orhan Pamuk said he regretted being unable to defend himself Friday in his trial for insulting the Turkish nation, which he said would stain Turkey's image.
"I am sorry that I could not make (my) defense," the 53 year old said in a written statement released by his publisher after the trial was suspended until February 7 immediately after the start of the first hearing.
"It is not good for Turkey or for our democracy for trials concerning freedom of thought which should never happen in the first place to be lengthy affairs," he said.
The court hearing the trial suspended the case pending authorisation from the justice ministry, which it says is essential for it to proceed.
The ruling came despite opposition from Pamuk's lawyer, Haluk Inanici, who asked the court to either proceed and hear his client's testimony, or drop the case altogether.
"My client's right to a fair trial was and continues to be violated,from the day the prosecution launched its investigation until today," Inanici said in a statement.
Pamuk risks a jail term of six months to three years for "denigrating the Turkish national identity" for remarks published in a Swiss magazine in February concerning the Armenian massacres during World War One.
The Istanbul court trying prominent Turkish author Orhan Pamuk on charges of insulting the Turkish nation on Friday suspended the trial until February 7 pending authorisation to proceed from the justice ministry.
The court had ruled on December 2 that since the alleged offence was committed before Turkey amended its penal code earlier this year, Pamuk should be judged under the old law, which requires a direct order from the justice ministry for the trial to proceed.
With Justice Minister Cemil Cicek saying in remarks published Friday that he still had not received the prosecution file, the court was froced to suspend the trial until the ministry reaches a decision on whether to try Pamuk or not.
The European Union said on Thursday that the trial of a leading Turkish novelist accused of insulting his country was a litmus test for Turkey's commitment to freedom of speech.
The trial of Orhan Pamuk starting Friday will also question whether Turkey is seriously committed to recent reforms it has made under EU pressure, such as guaranteeing freedom of expression, said EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn.
"The trial of a novelist who expressed a nonviolent opinion casts a shadow over the accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU," he said.
"This is an opportunity to set a positive precedent for the numerous other cases on free speech that are awaiting trial," he said.
"It is not Orhan Pamuk who will stand trial tomorrow, but Turkey."
The 25 nation bloc officially started entry negotiations with Ankara in October and insists Turkey meet EU standards on human rights before it can join.
Pamuk, whose books have been translated into more than 20 languages, faces up to three years in prison for telling a Swiss newspaper in February that 30000 Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed under Turkish rule in the early 20th century.
He denies that he used the word "genocide."
Turkey denies that the mass killings were genocide, saying the death toll is inflated and Armenians were killed in civil unrest as the Ottoman Empire collapsed.
Rehn said the number of recent prosecutions cast doubt on Turkey's new penal code, saying it may not provide sufficient protection for the freedom of expression one of the standards the EU has set for future members.
"The commission expects that the Turkish government will make it clear to the country's prosecutors and judges that ,the new penal code should be interpreted fully in line with the European Convention of Human Rights," he said.
The EU also expected the government to close the legal loopholes that allowed such restrictive interpretations on freedom of expression, he said.
Andrew Duff, a British lawmaker in the European Parliament, said Pamuk was "a beacon of liberal hope" in a society still torn between the ancient and the modern.
The Turkish government "must eliminate all archaic laws in Turkey that have been designed in a former period to protect the state against the citizen and to suppress freedom of thought or expression," he said.
The United States has also called on Turkey to drop the case, which will be heard in an Istanbul district court.
Pamuk's books include the internationally acclaimed "Snow" and "My Name is Red."
He has received numerous international awards.
EU enlargement commissioner Ollie Rehn lent support Saturday to prominent Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk, who faces trial in December over controversial remarks about the Armenian massacres and could end up serving three years in jail.
Rehn, who has just wound up an official visit to Turkey linked to its ambitions to join the European Union, called on Pamuk, the widely translated author of such internationally renowned works as "The White Castle", and "Snow", in his Istanbul apartment.
"I was glad to meet with my friend Orhan Pamuk," Rehn said afterwards.
"We discussed about Turkish literature, history and society."
Both men said they had not talked about Pamuk's forthcoming trial, but Rehn stressed, "Freedom of expression is a core European value.
Any country who wants to enter the EU has to share this value."
Pamuk for his part said they had discussed "literature, children, life" but also "democracy, human rights, freedom of thought."
The author praised the start of Turkey's negotiations for entering the EU, calling it "eminently positive."
Rehn aide Jean Christophe Filori stressed to AFP that the visit was during the "private part" of the EU commissioner's stay in Turkey.
Pamuk triggered a public outcry when he said in an interview with a Swiss newspaper in February that "one million Armenians were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares to talk about it."
As a result, Pamuk, who is to receive the prestigious peace prize of the Association of German Publishers and Booksellers on October 23, received several death threats and an official ordered the seizure and destruction of his works.
A prosecutor in Istanbul indicted 53 year old Pamuk on the grounds that his remarks amounted to "public denigration of the Turkish identity" and has demanded a prison term of between six months and three years, according to the author's publishers Iletisim.
The trial is expected to start on December 16, it added.
The massacre of Armenians during World War I is one of the most controversial episodes in Turkish history.
Armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kinsmen died in orchestrated killings nine decades ago during the last years of the Ottoman Empire, the precursor of modern Turkey.
Turkey argues that 300000 Armenians and thousands of Turks were killed in what was civil strife during World War I when the Armenians rose up against their Ottoman rulers.
Novelist Orhan Pamuk, facing three years in prison for remarks he made that allegedly denigrated Turkey, said he was not surprised about facing trial and is confident he won't go to jail.
"I cannot say I was surprised to be put on trial," Pamuk wrote in a letter to The New Yorker magazine and published in its Dec 19 issue.
The letter was posted on the magazine's Web site, too.
But he added: "I believe that the case against me is thin, I do not think I will end up in jail."
Pamuk will be tried Friday after Turkish prosecutors filed charges against him for insulting Turkish identity after telling a Swiss newspaper in February that "30000 Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares to talk about it."
He was referring to Kurds killed over the past two decades during Turkey's conflict with autonomy seeking Kurdish guerrillas, branded as a terrorist group by the U.S. and European Union, and to Armenians killed around the time of World War I. Armenians and several countries recognize those killings as the first genocide of the 20th century, which Turkey vehemently denies.
A delegation from the European Parliament will observe the trial.
"The hardest thing was to explain why a country officially committed to entry in the European Union would wish to imprison an author whose books were well known in Europe," Pamuk wrote.
Pamuk has been a vocal critic of Turkish politics for many years but an adamant supporter of the country's bid to join the EU.
His increasingly political writings have made him a figure of much controversy here.
The European Union (EU) sent a clear warning to Turkey on Thursday over the trial of a well known novelist, saying it would affect the Muslim country's EU accession process.
Orhan Pamuk, who has won a number of international awards in literature, will go on trial in Istanbul on Friday for "insulting" Turkey.
The charges stem from his remarks in an interview with a Swiss newspaper in which he said "30000 Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in Turkey" during World War I and in the 1980s and 1990s.
He also claimed that almost no one dares to speak out about this.
"The trial of a novelist who expressed a non violent opinion casts a shadow over the accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said in a statement.
Rehn said Turkey should make serious efforts in bringing its legislation in line with EU laws, including the European Convention of Human Rights.
"Full implementation of the (judicial) reforms will be the crucial foundation to facilitate progress in the accession negotiations," he said.
"It is not Orhan Pamuk who will stand trial tomorrow, but Turkey," the commissioner said.
"This is a litmus test to see whether Turkey is seriously committed to the freedom of expression and reforms that enhance the rule of law and benefit all Turkish citizens."
Pamuk is charged under Article 301 of Turkey's recently revised penal code, which carries a jail term of between six months and three years for a person who "explicitly insults" the Turkish republic.
Rehn said the new penal code "does not provide sufficient protection for the freedom of expression" and the Turkish government should "close the loopholes in the code."
The European Parliament said Wednesday it is sending observers to attend the trial of Pamuk to see whether Turkey's implementation of its new penal code is in conflict with the EU human rights laws.
Two U.S. states took up the issue of gay marriage on Wednesday, with preliminary arguments heard in a New Jersey Supreme Court case and a constitutional amendment against gay marriage passing in Idaho's state Senate.
Supreme Court Justices in New Jersey grilled lawyers about why the state should prevent homosexual couples from marrying in a case involving seven same sex couples who sued the state, saying it is violating its constitution by denying them the right to marry.
Conservative groups filed documents contending that allowing same sex marriage would harm society.
The state of New Jersey did not make that argument in defending its ban, but said allowing same sex marriage is an issue for lawmakers, not judges.
"To allow same sex couples to marry would not be removing a barrier to marriage, but redefining marriage itself," state Attorney General Patrick DeAlmeida told the seven member court.
Gay marriage is prohibited in all but one of the 50 U.S. states.
There are currently 18 U.S. states with constitutional amendments against gay marriage.
Most of those amendments were adopted after Massachusetts' highest court legalized same sex marriage in 2003, raising fears that courts in other states might do the same.
Vermont and Connecticut allow civil unions for gays, while California, New Jersey, Maine and Hawaii recognize more limited forms of gay partnership.
DeAlmeida fielded the brunt of the New Jersey judges' questions, including what might be protected by preventing same sex marriage in New Jersey, one of 16 states where it's specifically illegal to discriminate based on sexual orientation.
The state also has no legal barriers for same sex couples to adopt children and recognizes domestic partnerships, although those do not offer all the legal protections of marriage.
David Buckell, attorney for the seven couples, talked about the personal stories of some of his clients.
"How do plaintiffs answer their children's questions about why they are not married?" he said.
"The only answer is that the state does not think their relationships are worthy."
The court is not expected to issue a decision for months.
Both supporters and opponents of gay marriage held rallies Wednesday outside the building housing the high court.
In Idaho, a proposed constitutional amendment banning gay marriage passed 26 9 in the state Senate on Wednesday and will go to voters this November.
If approved, it would mean that in Idaho, "a marriage between a man and a woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized."
Opponents argued that a constitutional amendment isn't necessary because Idaho state law already defines marriage as being between a man and a woman.
Supporters say the amendment would prevent judges from overturning that law.
Last week, the measure passed the House 53 17 vote.
Associated Press Writer Chris Newmarker in Trenton contributed to this report.
The issue of same sex marriage is open for debate in Maryland, after a judge in the eastern US state rejected a state law banning such unions.
Baltimore Judge Brooke Murdock ruled that prohibiting gay marriage was discriminatory and in violation of the state's constitution State officials immediately appealed the ruling, setting the stage for another court battle on the controversial issue.
A 1973 Maryland law rules that only marriages between a man and a woman are valid, but Murdock ruled in favor of 19 gays and lesbians who filed suit last year, insisting that the law violated the state constitution.
Massachusetts is the only US state to recognize gay marriage, while Vermont and Connecticut recognize civil unions for same sex couples.
The legality of same sex marriage is also being debated in courts in California, New Jersey, New York and Washington state.
Some 18 states, meanwhile, have formally declared that marriage is exclusively for heterosexual couples.
Following Murdock's ruling, Maryland's Republican Governor Robert Ehrlich spoke out in favor of a constitutional amendment stipulating that marriages must be between a man and a woman.
Hundreds of homosexual couples in Britain are preparing to form civil partnerships in the coming weeks as the Civil Partnership Act comes into force on Monday.
It is the first day they can apply for a civil partnership to cement their relationships in law by notifying Registry Offices of their intent, although the couples will have to wait 15 days before holding a ceremony.
Under the Civil Partnership Act, which won Royal Assent in November 2004, gay and lesbian couples who want to form a partnership must register their intentions with local councils.
Unlike marriages, the signing of the legal partnership papers does not need to happen in public.
The partnerships will allow homosexuals to benefit from a dead partner's pension, grant next of kin rights in hospitals and exempt them from inheritance tax on a partner's home.
The Act does not use the term "gay marriage" but the civil partnerships have clearly been designed to be as close to a marriage contract as possible, the Sky news reported.
Partners will even be able to dissolve the agreement in a form of divorce.
Campaigners says the law ends inequalities for same sex couples.
The first ceremonies under the Civil Partnerships Act can take place in Northern Ireland on Dec 19, followed by Scotland the next day and England and Wales on Dec 21.
Hundreds of couples are expected to go ahead quickly, with Brighton in southern England conducting 198 ceremonies before the end of the year.
Overall, the city has taken 510 bookings for the coming months, thought to be the highest in the country.
Other cities which have seen strong interest include London, Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle and Edinburgh.
Meg Munn, minister for equality, said the government expected 4500 couples to get "partnered" in the first year.
"This is an important piece of legislation that gives legal recognition to relationships which until now were invisible in the eyes of the law," Munn was quoted by a local media.
"It accords people in same sex relationships the same sort of rights and responsibilities that are available to married couples, " she said.
Alan Wardle of gay campaign group Stonewall, said the importance of the change should not be underestimated.
"Our view is that civil partnerships are transformative for the lives of individual couples and their rights, but also for society more generally.
Society now legally recognizes gay relationships for the first time."
In his view, Dec 21, the date when the first partnerships take place, will be even bigger because that will see gay and lesbian people removing discrimination by holding their own ceremonies.
Canada's House of Commons passed landmark legislation Tuesday to legalize gay marriage, granting same sex couples legal rights equal to those in traditional unions between a man and a woman.
The bill passed as expected, despite opposition from Conservatives and religious leaders.
The legislation drafted by Prime Minister Paul Martin's minority Liberal Party government was also expected to easily pass the Senate and become federal law by the end of July.
Although gay marriage is already legal in seven provinces, the bill now grants all same sex couples in Canada the same legal rights as those in traditional union between a man and a woman.
The Netherlands and Belgium are the only other nations that allow gay marriage nationwide.
It was the last major piece of legislation before Parliament recessed for summer and comes on the first anniversary of Martin's leadership.
Thirty three of Martin's Liberal lawmakers voted against the bill and a Cabinet minister resigned Tuesday over the contentious legislation.
But enough allies rallied to support the bill that has been debated for months.
Martin, a Roman Catholic, hailed Tuesday's 158 133 vote as a necessary step for human rights and the protection of minorities.
"We are a nation of minorities," Martin said.
"And in a nation of minorities, it is important that you don't cherry pick rights.
A right is a right and that is what this vote tonight is all about."
There are an estimated 34000 gay and lesbian couples in Canada, according to government statistics.
Alex Munter, national spokesman for Canadians for Equal Marriage, which has led the debate in favor of the law, was triumphant after the vote: "The genius of Canada, almost unparalleled in the world, is built on shared identity, out of respect for each other."
Munter noted that is has been 30 years since the first homosexual couple applied for a marriage license in Canada.
"This has been a long, arduous road," he said.
"Lesbians and gay people are your brothers and sisters, neighbors, friends and co workers.
At the end of the day, no argument in favor of exclusion can withstand what people see with their own eyes: That it is wrong to treat people that they care about in a way that diminishes their personal choice."
Churches have expressed concern that their clergy would be compelled by law to perform same sex ceremonies, with couples taking them to court or human rights tribunals if refused.
The legislation, however, states that the bill only covers civil unions, not religious ones, and no clergy would be forced to perform same sex ceremonies unless they choose to do so.
The Roman Catholic Church, the predominant Christian denomination in Canada, has vigorously opposed the legislation, as well as major Islamic and Sikh organizations whose members believe the law would rock the foundations of traditional family.
Charles McVety, a spokesman for Defend Marriage Canada and president of Canada Christian College, called the vote an "onerous breach of trust and the deconstruction of so much that is dear to our hearts."
Flanked by clergymen, McVety vowed his group would work topple MPs who supported the legislation in the next general elections.
"This is the beginning of the formal fight against the redefinition of marriage," McVety said.
"We will, in the next election, be able to correct this incredible democratic deficit before us today."
The debate in Canada began in December, when the Supreme Court ruled that passage of same sex legislation would not violate the constitution.
According to most polls, a majority of Canadians supports the right for gays and lesbians to marry.
In the United States, gay marriage is opposed by a majority of Americans, according to an Associated Press Ipsos poll taken in November, shortly after constitutional amendments in 11 states to ban same sex marriage were approved.
Massachusetts is the only state that allows gay marriages, although Vermont and Connecticut have approved same sex civil unions.
Roberta Sklar, communications director for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington, D.C., said same sex American couples applaud Canadians.
"We know that it has been somewhat contentious in Canada, but at the same time the Canadians have largely approached this issue in a rational and democratic way and are providing a very positive model for the rest of the world," Sklar said.
Though hundreds of foreigners have come to Canada to seek civil ceremonies since gay marriages were first allowed in Ontario and British Columbia in 2003, not all countries or states recognize the unions.
While a slew of Israeli men were married in Toronto City Hall earlier this year, for example, the Israeli Interior Ministry does not recognize those unions.
In the United States, the federal government does not recognize same sex marriage and most states refuse to acknowledge marriage certificates from gay and lesbian couples, regardless of where they wed.
"Same sex marriage rights are extremely variable in the United States and whether Canadian marriages will be respected, state by state, is something yet to be determined," Sklar said.
Parliament has legalized gay marriage, angering conservatives and clergy as it made heavily Roman Catholic Spain the world's third country to grant full recognition to same sex couples, even letting them adopt children.
Gay activists wept with joy and thanked lawmakers by blowing them kisses.
The 350 seat Congress of Deputies approved the measure Thursday by a vote of 187 147 with four abstentions.
The bill, a divisive plank in the ruling Socialists' platform for social reform, gives homosexual couples the same rights as heterosexual ones.
"Matrimony shall have the same requirements and effects regardless of whether the persons involved are of the same or different sex," the bill states.
Conservative opposition lawmakers said they might challenge the law in court, while the church issued a veiled call for civil authorities who oppose gay marriage to refuse to wed same sex couples.
The bill became law immediately.
The Senate, where conservatives hold the largest number of seats, rejected it last week, but that chamber is only an advisory one and final say on legislation rests with the Congress of Deputies.
Gay couples can get married as soon as the law is published in the official government registry, which could happen as early as Friday or within two weeks at the latest, parliament's press office said.
The Netherlands and Belgium are the only other two countries that recognize gay marriage nationwide.
The former allows gays to adopt children, but Belgium so far is just considering it.
Canada's House of Commons passed legislation that would legalize gay marriage by the end of July as long as the Senate also passes the bill, which it is expected to do.
In the United States, Massachusetts is the only state to recognize gay marriage.
In debate before the vote, Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said the dry language of the Spanish reform masks "an immense change in the lives of thousands of citizens.
We are not legislating, ladies and gentlemen, for remote, unknown people.
We are expanding opportunities for the happiness of our neighbors, our work colleagues, our friends, our relatives."
The Spanish Bishops Conference lashed out at the law, saying that with it and a bill passed Wednesday making it easier for Spaniards to divorce, "marriage, understood as the union of a man and a woman, is no longer provided for in our laws."
"It is necessary to oppose these unfair laws through all legitimate means," a conference statement said, alluding to its hint last month that town hall officials who oppose gay marriage should refuse to preside over such ceremonies.
After the final tally was announced, activists watching from the spectator section of the ornate chamber cried and cheered, waving to lawmakers and blowing them kisses.
Several members of the conservative opposition Popular Party, which vehemently opposed the bill, shouted: "This is a disgrace."
Outside the stately 19th century chamber, activists waved the rainbow flags symbolizing the international gay rights movement.
"It is a historic day for the world's homosexuals.
We have been fighting for many years," said Beatriz Gimeno, a longtime leader of the gay rights movement in Spain.
"Now comes the hardest part, which is changing society's mentality."
Oscar winning Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar, who is gay, said 21st century families are different and don't have to reflect the traditional Catholic model.
"I don't like marriage.
I am not going to get married.
But it is important for this to be called marriage so people know that it is the same thing for everyone," he added.
Zapatero lacks a majority in the chamber but got more than enough help from small regional based parties that tend to be his allies.
Popular Party leader Mariano Rajoy said Zapatero has deeply divided Spain and should have sought a consensus in parliament that recognized same sex unions but didn't call them marriages.
Rajoy said that if the vast majority of countries don't accept gay marriage, including some run by Socialists, there must be a reason.
"I think the prime minister has committed a grave act of irresponsibility," Rajoy said.
He said his party is considering challenging the law before the Constitutional Court, Spain's highest tribunal.
The gay marriage bill was the boldest and most divisive initiative of the liberal social agenda Zapatero has embarked on since taking office in April 2004.
Under the divorce law reform, couples can end their marriage without a mandatory separation period or having to state a reason, as required under the old legislation.
Zapatero has also pushed through legislation allowing stem cell research and wants to loosen Spain's restrictive abortion law.
The Roman Catholic Church, which held much sway over the government just a generation ago when Gen. Francisco Franco was in power, adamantly opposed gay marriage.
In its first display of anti government activism in 20 years, it endorsed a June 18 rally in which hundreds of thousands of people marched through Madrid in opposition to the bill.
Some 20 bishops took part.
Still, polls suggest Spaniards support gay marriage.
A survey released in May by pollster Instituto Opina said 62 percent of Spaniards support the government's action on gay marriage, and 30 percent oppose it.
The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
But surveys also show Spaniards about evenly split over whether gay couples should be allowed to adopt children.
Homosexual rights activists urged the government Friday to grant homosexual couples the right to marry.
"Jennifer" (alias) met her Chinese girlfriend in England when she was studying for her doctoral degree.
When Jennifer graduated this year, she faced the difficult choice of staying in England with her girlfriend or returning to Taiwan to take care of her ailing mother.
Because Taiwan does not allow homosexual marriages or civil unions, there is no way for Jennifer's girlfriend to come to Taiwan as her partner.
Jennifer is just one of the cases revealed by the Taiwan Leshand Association on lesbian couples' real life predicaments.
Gay couples are not doing any better either, according to the Taiwan Tongzhi Homosexual Hotline Association, which revealed that "Ted" (alias) , a gay man whose boyfriend underwent surgery for cancer, was not allowed to take care of his boyfriend in the hospital because the hospital did not consider him as a family member.
The two associations made the revelations during a Legislative Yuan hearing Friday on the legalization of homosexual marriages.
Gender/Sexuality Rights Association Secretary General Wang Ping said that homosexuals should enjoy civil rights just like any other people.
"If homosexuals are citizens equal to others, they should be allowed to choose to enter into marriage or not.
But at present, the problem is that they cannot choose," Wang said.
"Marriage, as a social mechanism, offers many rights and protections.
But homosexual couples cannot choose to marry, and consequently they lose their entitlement to many civil rights, " she said.
Taiwan Tongzhi Hotline Association Public Affairs Director Ashley Wu said that homosexual couples are facing great difficulties in life and death because Taiwan does not allow homosexual marriages or civil unions.
Wu pointed out that his organization conducted a poll at the end of 2005 on homosexual marriages, and the poll showed that 89 percent of the homosexuals surveyed agree that homosexual marriages should be legalized, and 81 percent consider it to be a legal right.
Furthermore, 52 percent of the surveyed said that they want to be entitled to the rights enjoyed by married people, including lower taxes and the right to sign their partners' surgery consent forms.
"It is neither justified nor fair to deprive people of certain rights because of their sexual orientation," he said.
TEXAS LEGISLATION TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION BY BANNING SAME SEX MARRIAGE FACES HURDLE, 11 SENATORS EXPECTED TO HELP KILL MEASURE AUSTIN, Texas Eleven senators, enough to kill any piece of legislation, have told Lt. Gov.
David Dewhurst they will oppose a proposal to lock a ban on same sex marriages into the state constitution.
Dewhurst, nevertheless, said Thursday that he hoped the measure will win Senate approval before the session adjourns 10 days from now.
The Senate State Affairs Committee, meanwhile, began a late night hearing on the measure.
Committee approval would clear the way for a showdown on the Senate floor.
As approved by the House, the measure would define marriage as a union between one man and one woman and would prohibit the state or any local government from creating or recognizing "any legal status identical or similar to marriage," such as civil unions.
Dewhurst said the proposal would strengthen the state's existing law against homosexual marriages.
Opponents argue that it is a discriminatory attack on one group of people.
Kelly Schackelford of Dallas, president of the conservative Free Market Foundation, said it was necessary to lock the ban into the constitution to keep from having judicial challenges to the Texas marriage law as is occurring in other states.
"Judges all over the country are doing an end run around the people," he said.
"That's a perversion of our democracy and how our system is supposed to work."
Randall Ellis, executive director of the Lesbian/Gay Rights Lobby of Texas, said there are more than 43000 same sex couples in Texas, third behind New York and California.
"It is never right to allow the majority to decide the rights of minorities," he said referring to the November election that would be required to amend the constitution if the Legislature approves the bill.
Constitutional amendments must be approved by two thirds of the 31 member Senate, or 21 senators.
Eleven senators, if all hold firm, could kill the measure.
The Senate's operating procedure also requires a two thirds parliamentary vote to debate any legislation.
Dewhurst said he received a letter from 11 senators, asking that the same sex marriage ban not be brought to the Senate floor.
"But I talked to several of the senators, and we'll see," he added.
"I believe that we probably will have the votes."
Dewhurst didn't identify the 11 senators or release copies of their letter.
Sen Rodney Ellis, D Houston, who earlier this week used a parliamentary "tag" to delay the committee hearing on the controversial proposal, said he was one of the signers.
But he also declined to identify the others or say whether they included both Democrats and Republicans.
Sen Juan Hinojosa, D McAllen, said he also was among the 11 opponents.
He called the proposal "a misguided solution for a problem that doesn't even exist."
More than 200 witnesses testified against the ban in a committee hearing in the House last month.
The Spanish government Thursday approved plans for homosexual marriage, including the right of gay couples to adopt, making the country the most liberal in Europe, with Belgium and the Netherlands, in the field of gay rights.
A country by country review of current legislation: BELGIUM: Marriage between homosexuals became legal on June 1, 2003: since February 2004 it also covers foreigners.
For the union to be valid one of the partners needs to be Belgian or to live in Belgium.
Gay couples have the same rights as heterosexual couples, in particular insofar as inheritance and succession rights are concerned, but do not have the right to adopt.
CANADA: The Canadian lower house of parliament approved on June 28 a bill legalising gay marriages and adoption.
The bill is expected to be passed by the Senate at the end of July.
Before the federal legislation the majority of provinces had approved gay marriages.
NETHERLANDS: The Dutch Senate adopted in December 2000 legislation authorising civil homosexual marriage, the first country to do so, and the adoption by two same sex parents of children provided the children have Dutch nationality.
NORTHERN EUROPE: Denmark was the first country in the world to authorise (on October 1, 1989) a "registered partnership" between gays.
Homosexual couples have the same rights as heterosexual partners, except in the areas of insemination and adoption.
Norway (1993), Sweden (1994), Iceland (1996) and Finland (2001) followed suit.
In all these countries the law gives gay couples the same legal and social rights as married heterosexual couples.
Sweden is the only one to authorise adoption by gay couples (since February 2003).
In Denmark gay couples can only adopt their own children from previous relationships.
BRITAIN: A bill passed by parliament in March 2004 and expected to come into force in December this year, opens up the possibility for gays to sign a "civil partnership" which would authorise the continued payment of a pension in the event of the death of a partner or exempt the survivor from inheritance tax on property owned by the deceased partner.
In November 2002 a law was passed allowing gay couples to adopt.
FRANCE: In October 1999 the Civil Pact of Solidarity (PACS) giving legal status to non married couples, including gays, came into effect.
The two parties enjoy some but not all of the tax and social benefits of married couples, in particular in the field of inheritance.
Single people may adopt but not avowed homosexual couples.
Noel Mamere, the Green party mayor of the Bordeaux suburb of Begles in southwest France, "married" two gay men in June but a court declared the ceremony void the following month.
GERMANY: On August 1, 2001 a "registered partnership" came into effect which gives gay couples some rights enjoyed by different sex married couples, such as, the possibility of adopting the name of the partner, inheritance rights, gifts and tax on possessions, health and unemployment insurance.
But it does not confer the tax advantages enjoyed by married couples or the right to adopt.
The registered partnership allows an individual gay or lesbian to adopt a child while living in a gay couple.
However the individual alone is legally responsible for the child and not the couple.
CROATIA: The parliament adopted a law in mid July 2003, a law which provides gay couples with the same rights as defacto heterosexual couples.
NEW ZEALAND: The New Zealand parliament adopted in December 2004 legislation which confers to gay couples, who have officially declared their union, to have the same rights as heterosexual married couples.
But the law does not change the marriage act which defines it as a union between a "man and woman."
PORTUGAL: A 2001 law recognises de facto couples, regardless of sex, of more than two years and provides a number of tax benefits enjoyed by married couples.
Adoption by homosexual couples remains illegal.
SWITZERLAND: On June 5 referendum the Swiss voted in favour of a "registered partnership" for same sex couples.
The partnership is based on existing marriage laws but is distinct from them.
It bans adoption and medically assisted reproduction.
In the cantons of Geneva and Zurich forms of the French PACS operate for all administrative questions.
SOUTH AFRICA: In September 2002 the South African constitutional court recognised the right of gay couples to adopt children.
UNITED STATES: Since 2004 Massachusetts became the only US state to authorise gay marriages while Vermont and Connecticut, also in the northeast of the country, allow civil unions which offer homosexuals some of the rights enjoyed by heterosexual couples.
The state of New Jersey in December 1997 allowed adoption by homosexual couples.
A lawyer for eight gay couples argued in court Tuesday that Connecticut's marriage laws illegally create a separate class of people based on sexual orientation.
The couples, with the help of the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, sued in 2004 in an attempt to overturn the state's ban on gay marriage.
Last year, Connecticut approved civil unions for gay couples, which gives them the same legal rights as heterosexual married couples, but that law also defined marriage as existing only between a man and a woman.
That law "is nothing less than the government's announcement that these are second class citizens," Ben Klein, a senior attorney for Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, told Superior Court Judge Patty Jenkins Pittman.
GLAD used a similar argument in Massachusetts, where gay marriage became legal after a 2003 state Supreme Judicial Court ruling, and similar lawsuits are pending in other states.
In January, a Baltimore judge ruled that a law against gay marriage violates the Maryland Constitution's guarantee of equal rights.
Connecticut Assistant Attorney General Jane Rosenberg defended the laws Tuesday, arguing that there is no fundamental right to marry.
She said it was reasonable for the state to create civil unions to give gay couples the legal rights of marriage while also dealing with administrative issues, such as federal Medicaid and Medicare programs, which do not recognize gay marriage.
Pittman asked Rosenberg if Connecticut's law preventing same sex couples from marrying is any different from a Virginia law that prevented interracial couples from marrying until it was declared unconstitutional.
Rosenberg responded that race is not an essential part of marriage but gender is.
The judge did not immediately rule.
Jeffrey Busch of Wilton attended Tuesday's hearing with partner Stephen Davis and son Elijah.
"I'm pretty hopeful and optimistic," he said.
"Connecticut has done so much to allow us to be a family.
I believe the courts will correct this injustice of not allowing us to marry."
The Family Institute of Connecticut, which opposes gay marriage, has asked to intervene in the case, claiming the state attorney general's office is not vigorously defending Connecticut's marriage laws.
The state Supreme Court has not yet ruled on whether that group may become part of the case.
Elsewhere Tuesday, New Hampshire lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to defeat a proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.
The vote was 207 125.
The amendment would have defined marriage as a union of one woman and one man.
The vote halted this year's campaign for a constitutional ban of same sex unions in the state.
Currently, 17 U.S. states have constitutional amendments banning same sex marriage, and seven will vote in Novemeber on such amendments.
Sweden's Lutheran Church on Thursday decided to let homosexual partners be blessed in special church ceremonies but not in traditional weddings.
The issue has been debated since the secularized Scandinavian country recognized civil unions for homosexual couples in 1994.
The Swedish Church Assembly, the decision making body for the Church of Sweden, voted 160 81 to approve a blessing ceremony for same sex partnerships.
Sweden has a liberal attitude toward homosexuals, but gay marriage is not yet legal.
Later this year a government appointed committee is expected to file a report on whether the law allowing civil unions between homosexuals should be changed to include marriage as well.
More than 7 million of Sweden's 9 million inhabitants belong to the Church of Sweden, but few attend church regularly.
A lesbian couple who wed in Canada can seek to have their union legally recognized in Ireland, a judge ruled Tuesday in a case he predicted would have deep consequences for this predominantly Catholic country.
High Court Justice Liam McKechnie said lawyers representing Ann Louise Gilligan and Katherine Zappone had presented an arguable case that merited a full hearing, likely to take place next year.
Gilligan and Zappone who were married in British Columbia in September 2003 within months of the legalization of same sex marriage there are the first gay couple in Ireland to go to court to seek state recognition of a foreign marriage.
The case is also a legal first for Europe, where Belgium and the Netherlands already allow same sex marriages and several other nations grant homosexual couples similar tax, inheritance and child rearing rights as husbands and wives have.
Britain and Spain plan to follow suit soon.
Legal observers say the Irish women's case, if successful here, could inspire similar lawsuits in the most conservative quarters of Europe, where gay couples are denied the rights of married heterosexual couples.
Zappone and Gilligan are demanding that Ireland's tax collection agency, the Revenue Commissioners, allow them to file as a married couple rather than as two single people, which involves paying more tax.
The judge said the case "isn't simply about tax bands."
He noted that in a country where homosexuality itself was outlawed until 1993, any move to accord gay couples the same legal rights as husbands and wives would have "profound ethical, cultural and religious" ramifications.
He also cautioned that his ruling offered no indication as to whether the couple's complaint would be upheld or rejected, merely that it contained sufficient merit to be heard.
Zappone, a member of Ireland's government appointed Human Rights Commission, and Gilligan, a Dublin philosophy lecturer, have been partners for 23 years and live together in Brittas, a beachside resort south of Dublin.
They have worked together on poverty research and feminist rights projects since the early 1980s.
"Today is a happy day.
This is a happy case," Zappone declared outside the High Court, Ireland's second highest court.
"We have been exceptionally blessed by our unconditional love for, and fidelity to, one another," said Zappone, with her partner standing beside her.
"Yesterday and today are simply the first steps to seek legal recognition of our lifelong love and faithfulness."
Their lead lawyer, Gerard Hogan, argued Monday that neither Ireland's 1937 constitution nor its more recent tax laws explicitly defines marriage as solely between a man and a woman.
Hogan, one of Ireland's most prominent experts on constitutional law, said the Revenue Commissioners "have discriminated against them in an unjust and invidious manner, in breach of their constitutional rights and the European Convention on Human Rights."
He conceded that the Irish Constitution drafted 67 years ago by then Prime Minister Eamon de Valera undoubtedly presumed that "marriage" meant between a husband and wife, but argued that constitutional law should not be trapped within "the permafrost of 1937."
The case, if successful, would have major implications for Ireland's unmarried couples, both heterosexual and homosexual, in this predominantly Catholic country of 3.9 million.
The 2001 census identified 77600 households involving unmarried partners, among them 1300 homosexual couples.
Under Irish law, married couples enjoy advantages over unmarried couples, who pay higher income and inheritance taxes.
A judge on Tuesday threw out an amendment to the Louisiana Constitution banning gay marriage, a ruling applauded by civil rights advocates but dismissed by social conservatives as a temporary hitch in their campaign to limit the legal rights of gay and lesbian couples.
District Judge William Morvant said that the Louisiana Legislature, which wrote the amendment this spring before voters overwhelmingly approved it in September, had failed to make it narrow enough.
According to state law, constitutional amendments are valid only if they have a single legal purpose.
This one, Morvant ruled, had two: The first was to ban gay marriage, the second was to ban civil unions and domestic partnerships.
Morvant said the second ban was accomplished with this sentence: "A legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals shall not be valid or recognized."
That phrasing was not contained in early drafts of the amendment.
It was added during legislative debate at the behest of lobbyists who wanted to go beyond a gay marriage ban, said Evan Wolfson, executive director of Freedom to Marry, a nonprofit group that works nationwide for "marriage equality."
"The Christian Coalition got greedy," he said.
"You know the old saying: Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered."
Michael Johnson, an attorney for the Alliance Defense Fund, a nonprofit group that opposes gay marriage, said Morvant's decision would be appealed.
"Clearly the people knew what the amendment was intended to do and they agree with it," Johnson said.
Gene Mills, executive director of the Louisiana Family Forum, another group fighting to ban gay marriage, said that he "fundamentally disagreed" with the judge's decision.
He described it as a minor setback.
"This is the third quarter, late in the game," Mills said.
"We anticipated opposition in the legislative process, and we overcame it there.
We anticipated opposition at the pre amendment level, and we overcame it there.
We've got to play a whole other quarter of ball.
And we think we will be successful in the end."
Gay rights supporters had argued that the amendment was unnecessary since Louisiana already had a law banning gay marriage.
But opponents argued that without a constitutional amendment, gays could attempt to "export" marriages from other states to Louisiana.
If that happened, Mills said, institutions such as churches and schools would be forced to accept homosexuality.
And the public, he argued, would be forced to underwrite the costs of gay relationships, such as AIDS.
While heterosexual relationships result in children, he said, "You don't get the equivalent in a homosexual relationship.
"You get disease," Mills said.
Nearly 78 percent of voters in Louisiana supported the amendment, one of 13 similar measures states are weighing this fall.
Missouri voters approved an amendment banning same sex marriage earlier this year.
Measures are on the November ballot in Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon and Utah.
Most if not all are expected to succeed.
Randy Evans, an attorney representing a Louisiana gay rights group called Forum for Equality, predicted that Tuesday's decision would send civil rights advocates in other states scrambling to see if they could bring legal challenges on similar grounds.
And, he said, it will "give a boost to people around the country who are fighting these same amendments."
The Social Security Administration reversed itself late Monday and said that it would recognize marriage licenses issued for heterosexual couples by the clerk of the town of New Paltz, N.Y. Officials said that after getting a better understanding of the legal authority that local officials had to issue marriage licenses, they decided to overturn a policy that had been in effect for most of this year.
Until the reversal, the agency had refused to accept as identification any marriage document issued in New Paltz since February, when an official gained national attention by performing same sex marriages.
But Social Security officials failed to differentiate between the village of New Paltz, where the homosexual weddings took place, and the larger town of New Paltz, which refuses to recognize same sex marriages, and has the sole authority to issue legally binding marriage licenses.
The village in Ulster County issued same sex marriage affidavits to about 300 gay couples.
The town, which surrounds the village, has not issued marriage licenses to any gay couple.
About 125 heterosexual couples have been married in New Paltz since February.
But it was not until a recently married local woman, Susie Kilpatrick, went to a regional Social Security office on Dec 3 to legally take her husband's name that the new policy drew complaints.
When her application was rejected, Kilpatrick and her husband, Jeremy Wilkening, sought help from their congressman, Rep Maurice Hinchey.
Hinchey, a Democrat, wrote a letter urging the Social Security commissioner to recognize that the policy was arbitrary and overreaching.
Kilpatrick, 30, said she expected to try to change her name again next year.
"We're delighted that this has been reversed," she said.
"And we're sympathetic and hopeful that someday this will be extended to all couples that make the same lifelong commitments."
In a statement released by his office in Washington, Hinchey, on his way back from Ukraine, said the Social Security Administration should also overturn similar policies that remain in effect in Asbury Park, N.J., and in other places around the country that have permitted gay marriage ceremonies.
A court decision Friday made Saskatchewan the seventh Canadian province to authorize marriage between people of the same sex.
Same sex marriage is now allowed in more than half of Canada's 10 provinces and three territories.
Canadian media said five homosexual couples had asked to be married in Saskatchewan.
Citing legal precedents elsewhere in Canada, the Saskatchewan court ruled the Canadian law limiting marriage to a man and a woman is contrary to Canada's constitutional protections for all citizens, and is thus unconstitutional.
Same sex marriage was first authorized in Canada in June 2003 by an Ontario court, followed by court decisions in the provinces of British Columbia, Quebec, Manitoba and Nova Scotia, and the Yukon Territory.
The Canadian government has been saying for more than a year that it wants to legalize same sex marriage, but is awaiting a decision from the Canadian Supreme Court on the constitutionality of a draft law it has tabled on the question.
The government specifically wants a ruling on whether the draft law protects the right of churches to refuse to officiate in same sex marriage.
It seems a can't lose proposition: Ask voters to ban same sex marriages and they consistently endorse the idea, from the South to the West.
Kansas on Tuesday became the latest and 18th state to pass a constitutional amendment barring gay marriage.
With conservatives pushing to define marriage as between a man and woman throughout the country, similar proposals are on the ballot in three other states next year and more than a dozen are considering them.
The northeastern New England states have been the major holdout, there, legislators and judges have strengthened rights for gays and lesbians.
The Connecticut Senate on Wednesday voted to legalize civil unions.
If the bill becomes law, Connecticut would be the only state to do so without a court order demanding lawmakers act. Kansans voted by a more than 2 to 1 margin Tuesday to ban gay marriages and civil unions, and voters also ousted the lone gay city council member in Topeka, Tiffany Muller, who had defeated an emphatically anti gay opponent in the primary.
The New England examples most decisively Vermont's civil unions and Massachusetts' legalized gay marriages are seen by ban supporters as the threat that's helping their cause.
Advocates for gay marriage also see those examples as a plus, by proving that fears gay marriage will somehow destroy society's social fabric are unfounded.
"The more places that we are able to extend the same rights and responsibilities to all Americans, the more places we've got a light to shine on what's happening," said Joe Solmonese, president of Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights lobbying group.
"Massachusetts, the last time I checked ,is still there.
Marriage is still there," he said.
"People are going on with their lives, gay and lesbian couples are raising their families and living their lives like everyone else.
None of what has been forecasted or what we've been warned about seems to have happened there."
New England states aren't the only ones to offer gay rights activists hope.
California, Hawaii and New Jersey also allow for domestic partnerships though California and Hawaii also have states laws that define marriage as between a man and a woman.
Connecticut offers the strongest recent pro gay legislation, by extending all rights and privileges of marriage to same sex couples but without an actual marriage license.
On Wednesday, the state Senate voted 27 9 to recognize civil unions, proponents say the bill will likely clear the House also controlled by the Democrats possibly as early as next week.
Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell has not taken a stand on the bill, but has said she supports the concept of civil unions.
In Maine, a new law signed last month protects gays and lesbians from discrimination, though it made clear it doesn't extend the rights of marriage.
The state already allows for domestic partners, who could be homosexual or heterosexual, to have many of the legal rights of marriage, such as rights to inheritance and benefits.
New Hampshire set up a commission to study civil unions after legislators last year refused to recognize gay marriage.
For ban supporters, the key difference is a vote of the people.
"When the people are given a chance to decide, their view is overwhelming," said Peter Sprigg at the conservative Family Research Council.
"Every state that had this on the ballot passed it.
It shows to me there is a tremendous grass roots consensus that marriage is between a man and a woman."
Voters will decide the question in Alabama in June 2006, and in South Dakota and Tennessee at the 2006 election.
Bills are also moving forward in Minnesota, South Carolina and Texas to put the measure on the ballot there.
Meanwhile, courts are continuing to hash out the dispute, giving hope to both sides.
A California state judge ruled last month that the state law banning gay marriage was unconstitutional and that gay couples can marry.
A New York state judge ruled along similar lines in February.
Both decisions are under appeal.
"To be frank, every time one of those decisions comes down it just adds fuel to the fire for our efforts," Sprigg said.
"Courts are trying to take the decision out of the hands of the people."
Yale law Professor William Eskridge, a constitutional scholar active in support of gay rights issues, said that, in the end, New England won't be the lone holdout, and expects resistance to the bans across the Northeast and the West Coast.
But much of the rest of the country would likely back a ban, he said, predicting as many as 40 states would adopt them.
Ultimately, the dispute will be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.
And by then, years of gays and lesbians living as partners recognized by Massachusetts, Vermont and elsewhere will test the warnings of critics that gay marriage is a threat to the institution of marriage, he said.
"Now we have laboratories to observe whether these predictions would come true," Eskridge said.
"Now we can wait to see who's right."
Poland's upper house of parliament approved a bill Friday that would allow gay couples to gain legal partnership rights, immediately drawing sharp criticism from the nation's powerful Roman Catholic Church.
The senate voted 38 23 with 15 abstentions to send the draft to the lower house, or Sejm, where the bill was expected to meet resistance.
If it becomes law, the bill would allow gay couples to register with city or town officials, which would give them inheritance rights and other legal guarantees but not the right to adopt children.
Senator Maria Szyszkowska, a member of Prime Minister Marek Belka's Democratic Left Alliance who authored the bill, said the decision marks the "start of building tolerance in Poland."
But Father Jerzy Kloch, spokesman for the Polish Episcopate blasted the measure, saying it violates Poland's constitution, which says "a marriage is a union between a man and a woman."
"If this bill was implemented it would bring irreparable social damage for marriage and family and upbringing of children," Kloch said.
"The church has made its stand on the issue known many times during meetings between the church and the government and we hope such law will not be implemented in Poland."
Pope John Paul II, a native of Poland whose words carry great sway in this predominantly Catholic country, last month reiterated his outspoken opposition to gay marriage.
He warned against attempts to tamper with what he called "the irreplaceable" institution of marriage based family in an apparent reference to moves like granting homosexual couples social benefits.
Szymon Niemiec, the head of Poland's Association of Gays and Lesbians said the upper house's decision was a "huge success for Poland's democracy" but acknowledged it would be an uphill struggle to get the bill passed into law.
"This is the first, very difficult and very important step toward making this a normal country," Niemiec told Polish news agency PAP.
"A long a hard road is still ahead of us, but the most important step has been taken.
This is a huge change."
A US judge on Monday ruled that a California state law that effectively bans gay marriage is unconstitutional, a clerk of the court told AFP.
San Francisco Superior Court Judge Richard Kramer ruled that a state law limiting marriage as an exclusive union between a man and a woman violated a constitutional right to equal treatment.
The Spanish government Friday approved plans for homosexual marriage, including the right of gay couples to adopt, making the the country the most liberal in Europe, with Belgium and the Netherlands, in the field of gay rights.
A country by country review of current legislation: BELGIUM: Marriage between homosexuals became legal on June 1, 2003: since February it also covers foreigners.
For the union to be valid one of the partners needs to be Belgian or to live in Belgium.
Gay couples have the same rights as heterosexual couples, in particular insofar as inheritance and succession rights are concerned, but do not have the right to adopt.
NETHERLANDS: The Dutch Senate adopted in December 2000 legislation authorising civil homosexual marriage and the adoption by two same sex parents of children provided the children have Dutch nationality.
NORTHERN EUROPE: Denmark was the first country in the world to authorise (on October 1, 1989) a "registered partnership" between gays.
Homosexual couples have the same rights as heterosexual partners, except in the areas of insemination and adoption.
Norway (1993), Sweden (1994), Iceland (1996) and Finland (2001) followed suit.
In all these countries the law gives gay couples the same legal and social rights as married heterosexual couples.
Sweden is the only one to authorise adoption (since February 2003).
In January Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen backed a religious ceremony for gay couples.
FRANCE: In October 1999 the Civil Pact of Solidarity (PACS) giving legal status to non married couples, in UNITED NATIONS, Oct 1 (AFP) Lebanon and Syria have not met the demands in last month's UN Security Council resolution calling for the respect of Lebanese sovereignty, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said in a new report on Friday.
"The requirements on the various parties set out in resolution 1559 have not been met," said the report, obtained by AFP.
Voters in eleven US states voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to impose constitutional bans on gay marriage, one of the hottest issues in this year's presidential election, results showed.
Returns showed that all 11 state referenda on constitutional amendments that define marriage as being exclusively between a man and a woman had passed across the nation.
The measures, similar in structure across the nation, succeeded in Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon and Utah.
The amendments generally passed with a 3 1 majority, except in Oregon where earlier returns showed it had succeeded by about 55 percent.
Ohio's amendment was the most sweeping, also banning any legal status "that intends to approximate the design, qualities, significance or effect of marriage."
That would create a legal barrier to civil unions, as well as marriages for gay couples.
"It's a democratic tidal wave for marriage," said Matt Daniels, president of the Alliance for Marriage, one of the groups that pushed for the bans.
The move to change state constitutions reflected a growing public debate on same sex marriage after Massachusetts earlier this year became the first US state to sanction such unions.
The politically and socially divisive issue drove a wedge between civil rights lobbyists and conservative Christians earlier this year, climaxing in a failed bid, backed by President George W. Bush, to pass a federal constitutional amendment banning the practice.
The measure had been widely expected to pass in all 11 states where it featured on the ballot, said Jennie Drage Bowser, policy analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures, which monitored state ballot initiatives.
"Congress didn't really take this issue up this year in earnest and this sends a message to Washington that a lot of Americans feel strongly about this issue," she told AFP.
"But in many ways, these results also show that it's a state issue and that the states can deal with it themselves without federal government intervention," she said.
Supporters of legal bans on gay marriage were overjoyed that their stance had been so heavily endorsed across the country.
"These state amendments are a political dress rehearsal for the federal marriage amendment," the Alliance for Marriage's Daniels said.
Gay activists were angry but unsurprised at the development and vowed that the fight for legal equality for homosexual was far from over.
"We have lost a battle but the process has begun of winning the war," said David Buckel, director of the marriage project at gay rights lobby group Lambda Legal, which vigorously opposed the amendments.
"Most of these states already had their legislatures write discrimination into the statutes, and now they have enshrined it in their constitutions," he told AFP.
Political observers had said that the emotional issue of legalising gay marriage along with other issues including abortion and stem cell research could mobilise conservative voters at the polls Tuesday, boosting the re election prospects for Republican Bush.
The midwestern state of Missouri approved a constitutional ban on gay marriage by a huge margin in August, as did Louisiana in September.
Massachusetts legalized gay marriage in May while the eastern state of Vermont allows civil unions.
But in other states, the public reception to such innovation was frosty.
"We knew going into these amendment fights that we were going to take it on the chin in most places," said Matt Foreman, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
But he said: "This issue is going to be resolved by the US Supreme Court, and it's not going to give a damn what these state constitutions say."
The Spanish government on Friday approved a bill to legalise homosexual marriages, which will make it only the third country in Europe to condone same sex marriages.
It will also give gay couples the right to adopt.
The plan "recognises all rights for homosexuals, when it comes to qualifying for a pension, administering an estate, asking for a loan, authorising surgery for a partner," cabinet spokeswoman Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega told reporters.
"But also when it comes to asking to adopt a child."
The idea has been fiercely opposed by the Roman Catholic Church and a senior cleric earlier this week blasted the plans.
"It would impose on society a virus, something false, which will have negative consequences for social life," insisted Juan Antonio Martinez Camino, spokesman for Spain's Episcopal Conference.
But according to an opinion poll conducted in late July, some two thirds of Spaniards are in favour of gay marriages and now the cabinet has approved the bill such liaisons could become legal from as early as next year.
Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who took office in April, has made legalising gay marriages a key element of his social policy despite outrage from the Church.
Spain "is in the forefront of Europe and of the world in the struggle against centuries of discrimination," de la Vega said.
She said that about four million of Spain's 40 million inhabitants were homosexual.
Once the reform becomes law Spain will join the Netherlands and Belgium in allowing full homosexual marriage, though only the Netherlands allows gay couples to adopt.
Such unions are also legal in six Canadian provinces and the northeastern US state of Massachusetts.
De la Vega said: "There are thousands of children already living in Spain with homosexual parents and more than 50 studies show there are no differences between children who grow up with homosexual parents and others."
"Most Spanish people think what is important in adoption is the well being of the child quite apart from the sexual orientation of the parents," she said.
Some 14 articles of the civil code will be altered so that the words "man and woman" and "father and mother" are replaced by "partners" or "parents".
According to Justice Minister Juan Fernando Lopez de Aguilar, "this initiative has not been taken against anything or anyone" and he told the news conference that the government "is cooperating with the (Roman Catholic) Church and considers that an open conflict with it is not good."
"This law is part of the Socialist programme which has been voted for by the Spanish,"said Beatriz Gimeno, president of the country's Gay, Lesbian and Transexuals Federation.
"The Church has nothing to say about it.
This interventionist tendency by the Church is the virus and must be eradicated," .
The message focused particularly on countries supporting the US led coalition in Iraq and pointed out that their interests were everywhere.
"We must start the resistance from now ,against the Crusader campaign ,like resistance in Iraq, Afghanistan, in Palestine and in Chechnya," he said, taking aim in particular at the United States, Britain and France.
"Young Muslims, here is our message ,if we are killed or taken prisoner, continue the path (of resistance) after us.
Don't betray God and his Prophet," said the voice attributed to be Zawahiri's.
"It's the era of Muslim resistance, after the (Arab) governments submitted to the Zionist occupant.
We should learn the lesson of Chechnya, Afghanistan, of Iraq, of Palestine.
"Don't wait for the American, British, French, South Korean, Hungarian and Polish forces to enter Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen and Algeria to start the resistance," the speaker added.
"We should start the resistance from now.
The interests of the Americans, English, Australian, French, Polish, Norwegian, South Korean and Japanese are everywhere," he said.
"All (these countries) participated in the occupation of Afghanistan or Iraq or Chechnya, or help Israel to survive," added the voice.
Zawahiri, the righthand man of Osama bin Laden, was last heard in a videotape broadcast by the Qatar based news channel on September 9 in which he forecast a US defeat in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The US intelligence agency, the CIA, said then it believed that tape to be authentic and could have been recently recorded.
Freed by warming, waters once locked beneath ice are gnawing at coastal settlements around the Arctic Circle.
In Bykovsky, a village of 457 on Russia's northeast coast, the shoreline is collapsing, creeping closer and closer to houses and tanks of heating oil, at a rate of 15 to 18 feet a year.
Eventually, homes will be lost, and maybe all of Bykovsky.
"It is eating up the land," said Innokenty Koryakin, a member of the Evenk tribe and the captain of a fishing boat.
"You cannot do anything about it."
For the 4 million people who live north of the Arctic Circle, in remote outposts and the improbable industrial centers built by Soviet decree, a changing climate presents new opportunities.
But it also threatens their environment, their homes and, for those whose traditions rely on the ice bound wilderness, their culture.
The discovery of vast petroleum fields in the Barents and Kara Seas has raised fears of catastrophic accidents in the fisheries of Scandinavia.
In Russia, 20 percent of which lies above the Arctic Circle, melting of the permafrost threatens the foundations of homes, factories, pipelines.
Coastal erosion is a problem in Alaska as well, forcing the United States to prepare to relocate several Inuit villages at a projected cost of $100 million or more for each one.
Across the Arctic, indigenous tribes like the Inuit and the Samis, or Laplanders, whose traditions shaped by centuries of living in extremes of cold and ice are noticing changes in weather and wildlife.
As much as a quarter of the world's remaining oil and gas resources are believed to exist in the Arctic.
And as technology improves, oil prices rise and the seasonal ice cap retreats, oil shipments from countries like Norway and Russia are soaring.
The U.N. Environment Program estimated that 15 percent of the region's lands were affected in 2001 by mining, oil and gas exploration, ports or other industrial incursions.
But that figure is likely to reach 80 percent in 2050, it said.
The rate of ice melting in the Arctic is increasing and a panel of researchers says it sees no natural process that is likely to change that trend.
Within a century the melting could lead to summertime ice free ocean conditions not seen in the area in a million years, the group said Tuesday.
Melting of land based glaciers could take much longer but could raise the sea levels, potentially affecting coastal regions worldwide.
And changes to the permafrost could undermine buildings, drain water into bogs and release additional carbon into the atmosphere.
"What really makes the Arctic different from the rest of the non polar world is the permanent ice in the ground, in the ocean, and on land," said Jonathan T. Overpeck of the University of Arizona and chairman of the National Science Foundation's Arctic System Science Committee that issued the report.
"We see all of that ice melting already, and we envision that it will melt back much more dramatically in the future, as we move towards this more permanent ice free state," Overpeck said in a statement.
The panel's findings were published in Tuesday's issue of Eos, the weekly newspaper of the American Geophysical Union.
The report comes just days after environmental ministers and officials from 23 countries met in Greenland to call on governments to stop arguing over global warming and start acting.
That session was held in the town of Ilulissat, near the edge of the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier that has retreated nearly seven miles since 1960 and has become a symbol of fears that the planet is approaching a dangerous warming.
The report was issued following a weeklong meeting of scientists that examined how the Arctic environment and climate interact and how that system would respond as global temperatures rise.
In the past, Arctic climate has included glacial periods with ice sheets extending into North America and Europe, and other times of relative warming.
After studying how various parts of the climate system interact, the researchers said there are two major feedback systems influencing the region ocean circulation in the North Atlantic and the amount of precipitation and evaporation that takes place.
Feedback can accelerate changes in the system, they said.
For example, the white sea ice reflects solar radiation back into space, but as the ice melts the dark water will absorb some of the light, warming and melting more ice.
The scientists said they did not see any natural mechanism that could stop the loss of ice.
"I think probably the biggest surprise of the meeting was that no one could envision any interaction between the components that would act naturally to stop the trajectory to the new system," Overpeck said.
In addition to sea and land ice melting, Overpeck said that the frozen soil layer called permafrost will melt and eventually disappear in some areas.
That could release additional greenhouse gases stored in the permafrost for thousands of years, he said.
US and European scientists fear the collapse of ice shelves in Greenland and Antarctica will raise ocean levels faster than estimated, said a report published Friday in the journal Science.
The rapid breakdown of the floating ice shelves observed in recent years, the experts said, could destabilize land based ice sheets and glaciers behind them and cause faster melting and rise in sea levels than anticipated.
Current projections for rises in sea levels do not take into account the new hypothesis, said Peter Clark, professor of geosciences at Oregon State University.
"We may be more vulnerable to sea level rise than we thought and it may be more rapid than we have anticipated," Clark said.
"This is an issue we should take very seriously."
Current projections in climate models suggest that global warming during the next century or two will cause thermal expansion of water and some melting of glacial ice chiefly in Greenland.
However, that may be largely offset by increased precipitation and glacial buildup in Antarctica, leading to increased sea level of about 50 centimeters (20 inches) the scientists said.
The breakdown of glaciers currently being studied, said Clark, could double the sea level rise to a full meter.
And in a span of about 1000 years, he added, the Greenland ice sheet may disappear, raising Earth's sea level by about six meters (20 feet).
Glacial breakdown mechanisms currently being studied could speed that up considerably.
"It's become clear that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, much of which sits on land that's actually below sea level, is one of the most vulnerable in the world to these types of rapid breakdowns," Clark said.
"The real problem would occur if these smaller glacial breakups trigger larger ones, and rising sea levels by themselves might cause a feedback mechanism which would further speed up the process," the scientist added.
Two of Greenland's largest glaciers are retreating at an alarming pace, most likely because of climate warming, scientists said Wednesday.
But researchers at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union also presented studies of the retreat of Alaska's Columbia Glacier that suggest more complexity in the processes of glacial melt.
One of the Greenland glaciers, Kangerdlugssuaq, is currently moving at about nine miles (15 kilometers) a year compared to three miles (5 kilometers) a year in 2001, said Gordon Hamilton of the University of Maine's Climate Change Institute.
The other glacier, Helheim, is speeding at about seven miles (11 kilometers) a year up from four miles (6.5 kilometers) a year during the same period.
"It's quite a staggering rate of increase," Hamilton said during the AGU meeting.
Glaciers worldwide play a major role in discharging flowing water into oceans.
Sea levels have swelled globally an estimated 4 inches to 8 inches (10 centimeters to 20 centimeters) over the past century due to melting glaciers and polar ice enough to cause some low lying places to be awash at high tide or during severe storms.
Melting of Greenland ice and calving of icebergs from glaciers is responsible for about 7 percent of the annual rise in global sea level.
Global warming is frequently blamed for retreating glaciers around the world.
The rapid retreat of Greenland glaciers suggest that climate change is a factor, Hamilton said.
Meanwhile, one of the fastest melting glaciers in North America has reached the halfway point of disintegration and will continue retreat for another two decades.
Alaska's Columbia Glacier about the size of Los Angeles has shrunk nine miles (15 kilometers) since the 1980s.
It is expected to lose an additional nine miles (15 kilometers) in the next 15 to 20 years before the bed of the glacier rises above sea level.
The glacier, which moves about 80 feet (24 meters) a day, currently releases about 2 cubic miles (8.3 cubic kilometers) of ice every year into the Prince William Sound on the south coast of Alaska.
Understanding what happens during Alaskan glacier retreat could help explain the phenomenon in Greenland, said Tad Pfeffer, associate director of the University of Colorado's Institute of Arctic and Alpine.
Pfeffer said climate change warming trends do not directly explain the shrinking Columbia Glacier and other tidewater glaciers.
Instead, scientists think the retreat is triggered by a slow warming trend that began five centuries ago.
Significant thinning of the Columbia Glacier is thought to be caused by huge chunks of iceberg that break off into the sound as a result of seawater pressure rather than climate change, Pfeffer said.
The glacier, which is up to 3000 feet (915 meters) thick, has thinned up to 1300 feet (390 meters) in some places over the last two decades.
Since the 1970s, scientists have monitored the Columbia Glacier with satellites, lasers and aerial photography and found that the increase of its so called calving rate might be dangerous to shipping lanes in the sound.
The Arctic is on thin ice.
And explorer Lonnie Dupre has harrowing firsthand stories to prove it.
Dupre, 44, of Grand Marais, Minn., attempted the first summer crossing of the Arctic Ocean in May to highlight the dangers of global warming.
Working with Greenpeace, a nonprofit organization focused on solving environmental problems, Dupre and explorer Eric Larsen, 34, also of Grand Marais, left Siberia for the North Pole on May 12 with two canoe sleds.
But their expedition was cut short because of heavy rainfall and other conditions they did not expect until mid July: Temperatures reached 40 degrees, breaking the ice, and strong currents flowed south, making it difficult to walk, paddle, or ski.
On good days, they would travel eight to 12 miles, but when they slept, drifting ice pushed them back the same distance or more.
The team, which finally had to be airlifted out, plans to try again next spring.
Until then, Dupre plans to tour the United States to share details of his voyage, stress the threat of global warming, and show support for nature as a primary energy source.
(He's a fan of the proposed Cape Cod wind farm.)
The idea for the expedition came in 2001 during a 6500 mile trip around Greenland.
A 1982 map showed an area where two glaciers jutted a mile out to sea.
When Dupre reached the spot, the glaciers were not there.
It turned out the location was right, he said, but the glaciers had receded a mile inland.
Dupre plans to leave in April 2006 for his next Arctic expedition, three weeks earlier than he left this year, and with a little more insight about the effects of global warming.
"It's starting to snowball," he said.
"When the ice is gone, we're going to be in a world of hurt.
"IF YOU GO: Dupre is scheduled to speak about his adventures at Cape Cod Community College in Barnstable Sept 6 at 6:30 p.m. and to endorse the proposed Cape Cod wind farm, a project to install 130 energy efficient wind turbines in Nantucket Sound.
Also, Larsen will be touring New England next month aboard Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise, a 170 foot ice breaker.
The ship, which has been traveling around Greenland to observe the effects of global warming, will be open for tours at the Boston Harbor Shipyard and Marina, 256 Marginal St., on Sept 17 and 18, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The ship will then travel to various New England ports, and is scheduled to reach Nantucket on Sept 25.
Call 800 219 9260 or check www.projectthinice.org for more information, and to confirm dates and times.
The ship is not accessible to wheelchairs and has lots of steep stairs.
New satellite observations show that sea ice in the Arctic is melting faster while air temperatures in the region are rising sharply, scientists say.
Since 2002, satellite data have revealed unusually early springtime melting in areas north of Siberia and Alaska.
Now the melting trend has spread throughout the Arctic, according to a national collaboration of scientists.
The latest observations through September show that melting in 2005 began a record 17 days earlier than usual.
The observations showed 2.06 million square miles (5.27 million square kilometers) of sea ice as late as Sept 19.
That's the lowest measurement of Arctic sea ice cover ever recorded, the researchers said.
It's also 20 percent less than the average of end of summer ice pack cover measurements recorded since 1978.
At the same time, average air temperatures across most of the Arctic region from January to August 2005 were as much as 5.4 degrees F warmer than average temperature over the last 50 years, said the team of researchers from two universities and NASA.
"The melting and retreat trends are accelerating," Ted Scambos, of the University of Colorado at Boulder's National Snow and Ice Data Center, said in a statement released by the university.
The results have not yet been published in a scientific journal.
"The one common thread," Scambos said, "is that Arctic temperatures over the ice, ocean and surrounding land have increased in recent decades."
The scientists stopped short of directly blaming the melting trend on global warming but said they have few other explanations at this point.
During the 1990s, a cyclical atmospheric circulation pattern called the Arctic Oscillation was believed to have been pushing sea ice out of the region and into adjacent waters.
But the oscillation has weakened in recent years, and yet the melting continued and even accelerated.
"Something has fundamentally changed here, and the best answer is warming," said Mark Serreze, another researcher at the snow and ice data center.
Sea ice records in the Arctic are sketchy before 1978.
Since satellite observations began in earnest, researchers said Arctic ice has been retreating at a rate of more than 8 percent per decade.
And, they suspect, the melting may only contribute to even higher arctic temperatures in the future.
That's because the bright white ice tends to reflect more of the sun's radiation.
With more of the dark ocean exposed, the seawater tends to absorb more heat and reduce the amount of solar energy reflected back into space.
The researchers used satellite data from NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Defense Department, as well as data from Canadian satellites and weather observatories.
The Colorado institute led the study that also involved two NASA laboratories, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Washington.
Watching the gargantuan chunks of ice break off the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier and thunder into an Arctic fjord is a spectacular sight.
To Greenland's Inuit population, it is also deeply worrisome.
The frequency and size of the crumbling blocks are a powerful reminder that the ice sheet covering the world's largest island is thinning, which scientists say is one of the most glaring examples of global warming.
"In the past we could walk on the ice in the fjord between the icebergs for a six month period during the winter, drill holes and fish," said Joern Kristensen, a local fisherman.
"We can only do that for a month or two now.
It has become more difficult to drive dogs sleds because the ice between the icebergs isn't solid anymore."
In 2002 2003, a 10 kilometer (six mile) stretch of the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier broke off and drifted silently out of the fjord near Ilulissat, Greenland's third largest town, 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of the Arctic Circle.
Although Greenland is the prime example, scientists say the effects of climate change are noticeable throughout the Arctic region, from the northward spread of spruce beetles in Canada to melting permafrost in Alaska and northern Russia.
Indigenous people who for centuries have adapted their lives to the cold, fear that the changes, however small and gradual, could have a profound impact.
"We can see a trend that the fall is getting longer and wetter," said Lars Anders Baer, a political leader for Sweden's indigenous Sami, a once nomadic people with a long tradition of reindeer herding.
"If the climate gets warmer, it is probably bad for the reindeer.
New species (of plants) come in and suffocate other plants that are the main food for the reindeer," he said.
Rising temperatures are also a concern in the Yamalo Nenets region in Western Siberia, said Alexandr Navyukhov, 49.
He is an ethnic nenet, a group that mostly lives off hunting, fishing and deer breeding.
"We now have breams in our river, which we didn't have in the past because that fish is typical for warmer regions," he said.
"On the one hand it may look like good news, but breams are predatory fish that prey upon fish eggs, often of rare kinds of fish."
Melting permafrost has damaged hundreds of buildings, railway lines, airport runways and gas pipelines in Russia, according to the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, a report commissioned by the Arctic Council and released in 2004.
Research has also shown that populations of turbot, Atlantic cod and snow crab are no longer found in some parts of the Bering Sea, an important fishing zone between Alaska and Russia, and that flooding along the Lena River, one of Siberia's biggest, has increased with warming temperatures.
In Greenland, Anthon Utuaq, a 68 year old retired hunter, said he is worried a warmer climate will make it more difficult for his son to continue the family trade.
"Maybe it will be difficult for him to find the seals," Utuaq said, resting on a bench in the east coast town of Kulusuk.
"They will head north to colder places if it gets warmer."
Arctic sea ice has decreased by approximately 8 percent, or nearly 1 million square kilometers (3861000 square miles) over the past 30 years.
In Sisimiut, Greenland's second largest town, lakes have doubled in size in the last decade.
"Greenland was perceived as this huge solid place that would never melt," said Robert Corell of the American Meteorological Society.
"The evidence is now so strong that the scientific community is convinced that global warming is the cause."
Climate change has been a hotly discussed issue for decades, but efforts to fight it have moved slowly.
There is not even unanimity on how much of the problem is a result of human activity, notably the burning of fossil fuels, and how much of it can be attributed to natural processes.
"We know that temperatures have gone up and it's partly caused by man.
But let's hold our horses because it's not everywhere that the ice is melting.
In the Antarctic, only 1 percent is melting," said Bjoern Lomborg, a Danish researcher who claims the threat of global warming has been exaggerated.
What is clear is that the average ocean temperature off Greenland's west coast has risen in recent years from 3.5 C (38.3 F) to 4.8 C (40.6 F) and glaciers have begun to retreat, said Carl Egede Boeggild, a glaciologist with Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, a government agency.
The Sermilik glacier in southern Greenland has retreated 11 kilometers (6.84 miles), and the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier near Ilulissat also is moving at a faster pace, said Henrik Hoejmark Thomsen of the geological survey.
In 1967, satellite imagery measured it moving at 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) per year.
In 2003, it was twice that 13 kilometers (8.1 miles) per year.
"What exactly happened, we don't know but it appears to be the effect of climate change," said Hoejmark Thomsen.
Last month, U.S. scientists issued a report saying the rate of ice melting in the Arctic is increasing and within a century could lead to summertime ice free ocean conditions not seen in the area in a million years.
With warmer temperatures, some bacteria, plants and animals could disappear, while others will grow and thrive.
Polar bears and other animals that depend on sea ice to breed and forage are at risk, scientists say.
There are fears that polar bears and some seal species could face extinction in just decades because of global warming.
The thinning of the sea ice presents a danger to both humans and polar bears, said Peter Ewins, director of Arctic conservations for the World Wildlife Fund Canada.
"The polar bears need to be there to catch enough seals to see them through the summer in open warm water systems.
Equally, the Inuit need to be out there on the ice catching seals and are less and less able to do that because the ice is more unstable, thinner," he said.
When NASA started taking satellite images of the Arctic region in the late 1970s and computer technology improved, scientists noted alarming patterns and theorized they were caused by the emission of so called greenhouse gases, emitted by industries and internal combustion engines, that create a heat trapping layer in the atmosphere.
Inuit leaders, like Sheila Watt Cloutier whose efforts won her the 2005 Sophie environment prize in Norway earlier this year, are trying to draw attention to the impact of climate change and pollution on the traditional lifestyles of the Arctic's indigenous people.
"When I was a child, the weather used to be more stable, it worries me to see and hear all this," Greenland Premier Hans Enoksen said on the sidelines of an environmental officials' meeting in Ilulissat last month.
The meeting ended with statements of concern, sincere calls for measure to address the problem and no action.
The Kyoto Protocol that took effect in February aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.
But the 140 nations that have signed the pact don't include the United States, which produces one quarter of the gases.
U.S. President George W. Bush's administration says participating in the pact would severely damage the U.S. economy.
Many scientists say that position undermines the whole planet and they point to Greenland as the leading edge of what the globe could suffer.
"Greenland is the canary in a mine shaft alerting us," said Corell, the American meteorologist.
"In the U.S., global warming is a tomorrow issue,For us working here, it hits you like a ton of bricks when you see it."
AP writers Maria Danilova and Jim Heintz in Moscow, Karl Ritter in Stockholm, Sweden, and Beth Duff Brown in Toronto contributed to this report.
Climate change could thaw the top 11 feet (3.35 meters) of permafrost in most areas of the Northern Hemisphere by 2100, altering ecosystems across Alaska, Canada and Russia, according to a federal study.
Using supercomputers in the United States and Japan, the study calculated how frozen soil would interact with air temperatures, snow, sea ice changes and other processes.
The most extreme scenario involved the melting of the top 11 feet of permafrost, or earth that remains frozen year round.
"If that much near surface permafrost thaws, it could release considerable amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and that could amplify global warming," said lead author David Lawrence, with the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
"We could be underestimating the rate of global temperature increase."
The study was published Dec 17 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters and presented earlier in the month at a science conference in San Francisco.
A permafrost researcher at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, however, disagrees that the thaw could be so large.
Alaska's permafrost won't melt that fast or deep, said Vladimir Romanovsky, who monitors a network of permafrost observatories for the Geophysical Institute.
If air temperatures increase 2 to 4 degrees over the next century, permafrost would begin thawing south of the Brooks Range and start degrading in some places on Alaska's Arctic slope, he said.
But a prediction that melting will reach deeply over the entire region goes too far, he said.
The computer climate model didn't consider some natural factors that tend to keep the permafrost cold, Romanovsky said.
For example, deeper permafrost, largely untouched by recent warming at the surface, would have an influence.
Lawrence said he hopes to collaborate with Romanovsky to fine tune future studies to deal with those deeper layers.
Environment ministers from around the world heard a grim warning about the threat to the Arctic Wednesday as they began three days of talks to climax a key conference on climate change here.
Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin, whose country is hosting the 12 day conference, said his nation's far north had become "an incubator for the altered world of tomorrow."
"High in the Arctic, in our interior and along our coasts, the country we know is being transformed," he said.
"Winters are growing milder, summers hotter and more severe, there is plant life where before there was none, there is water before there was ice.
Our permafrost is thawing, and releasing methane gas into the atmosphere."
He added: "Within short decades, the Northwest passage, the famously unnavigable thoroughfare of history, may be passable a striking and unsettling example of our delicate balance succumbing to untenable strain."
Martin blasted the small but influential minority of skeptics who doubted that Man had interfered with Earth's delicate climate balance.
"The time is past to debate the impact of climate change.
We no longer need to ask people to imagine its effects, for now we can see them."
The conference gathers ministers or their stand ins from 189 countries and entities under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the fruit of the 1992 Rio Summit.
The meeting's big focus is the future of the Kyoto Protocol, the troubled UN pact on curbing greenhouse gases.
Emissions of this carbon pollution have surged in the past century thanks to unbridled use of oil, gas and coal.
The gases act like an invisible blanket, trapping the Sun's heat and driving up the planet's surface temperature and disrupting climate cycles.
Scientists say there is mounting evidence that the first effects of climate change are already kicking in, with the melting of Alpine and Himalayan glaciers and erosion of Arctic and Antarctic icesheets.
They also speculate that this year's unprecedented season of Atlantic storms, spearheaded by Hurricane Katrina which devastated New Orleans, was caused by global warming.
Tackling the pollution is a big headache because of the economic cost.
Rich countries, which are most to blame for the problem, will have to make big strides in fuel efficiency and switch to cleaner energy sources.
Developing countries, meanwhile, will have to avoid becoming dependent on fossil fuels, which have a big cost advantage over fledging alternative technologies.
The United States, the world's No. 1 carbon polluter, walked away from Kyoto in 2001.
President George W. Bush said the scientific evidence for climate change was incomplete and complained that Kyoto's legal requirements for reducing emissions were too costly for the US economy.
Martin made a veiled attack on this position by warning that no one was immune from climate change.
"The time is past to seek comfort in denial.
The time is past to pretend that any nation can stand alone, isolated from the global community,there can be no hiding on any island, in any city, within any country, no matter how prosperous, from the consequences of inaction."
A group of countries which fringe the Arctic waters of the Barents Sea gathered in Norway on Thursday and heard that they must go beyond the UN's Kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse emissions.
"We have not done enough considering the magnitude of the challenge," Finnish foreign minister Erkki Tuomioja told a meeting of the Barents council, which groups Russia, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Iceland as well as the European Union.
The Arctic's atmosphere is warming twice as fast as elsewhere on earth, and experts have warned that the region's ice could melt away completely by the end of this century, endangering many animal species and the traditional lifestyle of Inuits and Lapplanders.
The UN's Kyoto treaty commits 39 industrial nations and territories to trim their output of six greenhouse gases especially carbon dioxide on average by five percent between 2008 and 2012, compared with 1990 levels.
Its impact has however been limited, partly because the world's biggest polluter nation the United States refused to sign up.
But already, the Kyoto protocol "is not enough", Tuomioja charged.
"We are already starting with the post Kyoto issues."
Countries still dragging their feet, like the US, China and India, should be persuaded to contribute to these efforts, he said.
Sweden's trade and industry minister, Thomas Oestros, called on the other delegates to follow the lead of his country, which is hoping to become independent of fossil fuels by 2020, by developing the use of biofuels.
Conference host Norway, the world's third largest oil exporter, also said the Kyoto protocol needed to be respected and that new measures after 2012 had to be envisaged already.
Norway plans to finance research into greenhouse emission recycling, and is currently studying the possibility of injecting carbon dioxide produced on land into offshore hydrocarbon fields, an environmentally friendly measure which would also increase the productivity of North Sea oil and gas platforms.
Interior Alaska's permafrost has warmed in some places to the highest level since the ice age ended 10000 years ago, its temperature now within a degree or two of thawing.
Earth frozen since woolly mammoths and bison wandered Interior steppes has been turning to mush.
Lakes have been shrinking.
Trees are stressed.
Prehistoric ice has melted underground, leaving voids that collapse into sinkholes.
Largely concentrated where people have disturbed the surface, such damage can be expensive, even heartbreaking.
It's happening now in Fairbanks: Toppled spruce, roller coaster bike trails, rippled pavement, homes and buildings that sag into ruin.
And the meltdown is spreading in wild areas: sinkholes, dying trees, eroding lakes.
These collapses bode ill: They are omens of what scientists fear will happen on a large scale across the Arctic if water and air continue to warm as fast as climate models predict.
"So far, we have only some local places where permafrost is thawing naturally," said expert Vladimir Romanovksy, a Russian born geophysicist at the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
"But we are very, very close to this point when it (all) starts to thaw."
After record high temperatures during the summer of 2004 and last winter's deep insulating snow, Romanovsky said he expects Interior permafrost will again be significantly warmer than normal this year still closer to melting.
The Geophysical Institute and Romanovsky maintain the world's most extensive network of permafrost "observatories" basically thermometers sunk deep into the frozen earth, many along the trans Alaska oil pipeline.
What they report is disconcerting.
Permafrost is shrinking: warming on the bottom from the Earth's natural heat, warming on the top because of air temperature and deep snows.
It's like holding an ice cream sandwich in your hand on a sunny day.
While the icy center stays hard, it shrinks as the top and bottom both melt.
"Our permafrost is still stable, even though it is very, very warm," Romanovsky said.
"But the moment it starts to thaw, we will be able to say we are the warmest we have been the last 100000 years."
For a glimpse of that future, look no farther than the hills north of Fairbanks, near where Romanovsky lives with his wife and two of his three sons.
In a meadow on his mother in law's property, weird six foot deep channels and holes crisscross the ground, trenches and bomb pits from what amounts to thermal warfare.
A small hole opened up in the sod a few years ago, curving down into the earth like some gopher den.
This spring, his sons and other children playing near the house discovered the bottom had fallen out.
The cavity was now large enough to bury a person.
No one has crawled down to see where it ends.
Romanovksy discourages his sons playing in the field.
"It is not safe," he said.
Maybe 100 yards away, other sinkholes have formed along the shoulder of Goldstream Road, the main travel route for residents of the rural valley.
Romanovksy took photos of his sons by one hole in 2001 and matched them to another set taken this spring.
In the successive snapshots, the boys grow taller, the hole grows deeper.
The newest chasm maybe 10 feet across had been filled with gravel by highway crews.
But only a few weeks later, concentric cracks circled a depression.
It looked like a bull's eye.
Romanovsky is part of a small army of scientists investigating Arctic climate change.
He teaches UAF college students, conducts research with the International Arctic Research Center and hopes to expand ground frost monitoring to other parts of the world with a grant from the National Science Foundation.
Since emigrating from Moscow in 1990, Romanovksy has found that Fairbanks offers a kind of paradise for a family man/permafrost scientist a middle class paycheck in a small town surrounded by frozen ground.
Now 51 and a naturalized U.S. citizen, he still has a bulldog build from his days as a hockey defenseman for Moscow State University.
He has two Ph.D.s, with training in mathematics, geology and the physics of how frozen dirt sheds heat.
Permafrost experts once labored in obscurity, he said.
Graduate students were drawn to more glamorous topics, like glaciers and sea ice.
After all, he said, "permafrost is frozen dirt."
But the importance of permafrost as an indicator of climate change and the realization that its thaw could alter the northern landscape and release vast stores of greenhouse gases into the air has ignited huge interest.
"It's just exploded since last year," said Romanovsky, who starred in a recent New Yorker piece on global warming.
"I'm going to have to stop giving interviews."
Permafrost degradation is only one element in a climate shift well under way.
Overall, during the last half century, the Arctic has been warming much faster than the rest of the world.
Alaska's average annual air temperature has increased 3.3 degrees between 1949 and 2003, with some areas rising almost twice as much, especially in winter and fall, according to the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment published last fall.
The most obvious signs are shrinking sea ice, melting glaciers and the thawing trend in permafrost, said Syun Akasofu, director of the Arctic research center, in a briefing this spring with Floyd DesChamps, a staffer of the U.S. Senate Commerce committee.
While warming is definitely happening, the causes remain unclear.
Natural climate cycles that reach back thousands of years and greenhouse gases released by human activity both appear to be driving the warmth.
But researchers still do not know which factors contribute more, Akasofu said.
Romanovsky warns that, whatever the reason, permafrost is easing closer to the thawing point across Interior Alaska.
Will spruce forests transform into grassland?
Will roads, buildings and pipelines collapse?
Will Alaskans be forced to spend millions repairing damage?
One thing is certain, he said.
"The permafrost we have was established during the last ice age, and now it's deteriorating."
The current retreat of ice shelves in the Antarctic due to global warming is nothing new but this time the problem is manmade and therefore potentially more serious, according to research released Wednesday.
Writing in the latest issue of the journal "Geology," British scientists said a survey had shown that ice shelves had retreated thousands of years ago as a result of rising air and ocean temperatures.
"What this tells us is that ice shelves don't just break up because they get too big as the global warning skeptics argue," said Dominic Hodgson, a scientist with the British Antarctic Survey and one of the leading investigators.
He said previous periods of warming about 9500 years ago and some 2000 years to 4000 years ago were caused by natural causes, including the ending of ice ages, rather than man's emissions and the ice shelves had been able to reform.
"This time, the problem is man made and if we don't take steps, the damage will be worse," he said.
"There is no room for complacency."
The study, by scientists from the universities of Durham, Edinburgh and from the British Antarctic Survey, or BAS, said the George VI Ice Shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula is the first to show that a currently 'healthy' ice shelf experienced an extensive retreat about 9500 years ago, more than anything seen in recent years.
BAS scientists Carol Pudsey and Jeff Evans reported that the Prince Gustav Ice Shelf, which collapsed in 1995, had also collapsed several thousand years ago.
This, along with the recent collapse of other ice shelves like Larsen B, has been put down to an overall increase in temperatures caused by damage to the ozone layer that protects the earth from the sun.
The study is particularly relevant for other surveys on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet where scientists have found that a relatively warm current, Circumpolar Deep Water, is causing high melt rates on the underside of an ice shelf in Pine Island Bay.
The gradual removal of this ice shelf may be causing the glaciers inland to flow faster, which could lead to enhanced drainage of part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and a rise in sea level.
The BAS says that over the past 900000 years, there has been an average of 280 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, one of the main causes of global warming.
In the period since the Industrial Revolution, and particularly in recent years, that has risen to 350 parts per million.
The scientists analyzed sediments from the bottom of a freshwater lake close to the edge of the present George VI Ice Shelf.
The results revealed that about 9500 years ago the shelf retreated, allowing the sea to flood into the lake.
The ice shelf didn't reform until 1500 years later, and has been present ever since.
Ice shelves are formed when glaciers flow into the sea and freeze, then coalesce with other frozen flows.

An accelerating Arctic warming trend over the past quarter century has dramatically dried up more than a thousand large lakes in Siberia, probably because the permafrost beneath them has begun to thaw, according to a paper set to be published Friday in the journal Science.
Comparing satellite images captured in the early 1970s to those from recent years, a team of American scientists determined that the number of large lakes in a vast, 200000 square mile region of Siberia diminished by about 11 percent from 10882 to 9712.
About 125 of the 1170 shrunken lakes disappeared altogether, and most are now considerably smaller than the study's baseline of 40 hectares, or roughly 99 acres, the researchers found.
If Arctic temperatures continue to rise, the scientists warned, many of the lakes that are now ubiquitous in high northern latitudes could eventually disappear.
"An 11 percent decline may not sound like much, but in the time scale in which landscapes naturally change, this is extraordinarily fast," said the paper's lead author, Laurence C. Smith, an associate geology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.
He conducted the research with UCLA colleague Glen M. MacDonald, Yongwei Sheng of the State University of New York, and Larry Hinzman of the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.
While the researchers did not determine the cause of the losses, they found that the location of disappearing lakes in areas of Siberia where permafrost, formerly frozen as solid as concrete, is now known to be softening.
They believe the lakes are receding because the water is seeping into the increasingly mushy ground, a finding that scientists already have confirmed in portions of Alaska where Arctic lakes are also drying up.
By contrast, the scientists found that in Siberian areas where the ground below is still permanently frozen, the number of lakes actually increased by about 4 percent and total lake area grew by about 12 percent over the past three decades.
That is consistent with scientific predictions that in the short run, global warming would lead to more shallow ponds and lakes in thermokarst, or small pits and depressions caused by a thawing of turf at ground level.
Average Arctic temperatures have risen at nearly twice the rate of overall global temperatures in recent decades, according to the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, a comprehensive evaluation of warming in the region conducted by eight nations and six organizations of indigenous people.
In Alaska and western Canada, temperatures have increased by as much as 7 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 50 years, according to the assessment, which was concluded last year.
Although the regions experiencing the changes are not home to high numbers of humans, the loss of surface water is expected to affect freshwater supplies for native people in the Arctic.
It is also predicted to have more immediate and profound effects on Arctic ecosystems, notably the lake habitat many migratory birds rely upon, Smith said.
"If you were to lose the Arctic lakes, that would be hugely important for waterfowl," MacDonald said.
"If permafrost continues to melt, it could also affect everything from oil platforms to landing strips.
In west Siberia, there is not much geology there aside from the permafrost and peatlands.
If the permafrost goes away, the lakes are going to go away."
Scientists looking southward from the tip of South America, over steel gray waters toward icy Antarctica, see only questions on the horizon about the fate of the planet.
Now that one mammoth Antarctic ice shelf has collapsed into the ocean, when might another, bigger one crumble and slip into a warming sea?
In 1000 years?
In 100 years?
Sooner?
Never?
"People don't have the answer to the question yet what the probability is of that collapse, if any," said scientist Gino Casassa.
"But there's some indication of instability."
Casassa and fellow Chilean researchers had just flown back from the icy continent to this expedition staging point, and brought with them some potentially unsettling news.
On a two month roundtrip trek by snow tractor to the South Pole, they pointed their sophisticated radar at the ground and found that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet may be thicker than thought, many hundreds of feet (meters) thicker in parts.
Glaciologists like Casassa worry most about that western ice sheet, half a continent of frozen water believed enough, if gradually melted, to raise ocean levels worldwide by about five meters (15 feet).
That would be a slow motion catastrophe for global coastlines not instantly deadly like a tsunami, but more universal and permanent.
And "the deeper the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the greater the potential impact to sea level," Casassa pointed out, though cautioning that their data awaits full analysis.
Such pressing questions about the white continent and global warming and the impact each will have on the other are consuming more and more scientific resources these days, as hundreds of researchers migrate south in the southern summer to probe, measure and observe in an on the ice search for answers.
Advanced technology, like the radar lent by the University of Kansas, allows scientists to penetrate darker corners of polar science.
ICESat, a NASA satellite launched two years ago, is giving them an unprecedentedly precise look at the state of the ice in both the Arctic and Antarctic.
The same U.S. space agency, meanwhile, is boosting the power of its supercomputers to speed through millions of calculations to foresee temperature, evaporation, precipitation and other changes far into the future, using complex climate models.
The challenges remain huge, however, on the globe's most forbidding landscape.
And technology sometimes fails.
One of the ice surveying satellite's laser eyes went dead, for one thing, reducing its useful data by more than half.
For another, the vast continent has too few permanent monitoring stations to give scientists more than a sketchy grasp of its climate behavior.
"Even now, we're not so sure what's going on in all Antarctica.
There aren't sufficient data," said Argentina's Pedro Skvarca, a veteran Antarctic glaciologist.
The hunt for data took on fresh urgency after Antarctica's "Larsen B," an ice shelf bigger than Luxembourg, collapsed into the Southern Ocean over the space of just 35 days in 2002.
The 3380 square kilometers (1300 square miles) of ice had fringed the Antarctic Peninsula, a rocky arm of land that reaches north to within 750 miles of this southernmost Chilean city.
In that peninsular region, average surface temperatures have risen by 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) over 50 years.
Temperatures globally rose about 0.6 degrees Celsius (1 degree Fahrenheit) in the past century, most of that attributed by scientific consensus to the accumulation in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other warming "greenhouse gases," mostly from fossil fuel burning.
It hasn't been established whether the Antarctic Peninsula warming stems directly from global warming, or from more localized conditions.
Because an ice "shelf" already floats on the sea, displacing its weight in water, Larsen B's disintegration and that of the smaller, nearby Larsen A in 1995 didn't raise ocean levels.
But what has happened since did.
Skvarca and American researchers, collating aerial reconnaissance with ICESat images, reported last September that land based glaciers backed up behind Larsen B have accelerated their flow since its break up moving ice into the sea up to eight times faster than before.
Now scientists are warily watching the Larsen C ice shelf, farther south and 20 times larger.
Like the B sector before it collapsed, "Larsen C also appears to be thinning," said Robert Thomas, a researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center facility in Virginia.
"It's quite possible that the thinning is the precursor to the breakup."
Scientists expect Larsen C to disintegrate sometime in this century, Skvarca said in a telephone interview from Buenos Aires.
"We should bear in mind what is happening to the Larsen ice shelves, because if it also happens to a big shelf, we are going to be in trouble," he said.
"Big" refers to the floating giants the Ross and Ronne ice shelves.
Each is around 520000 square kilometers (200000 square miles).
They lie deeper south in a more frigid zone, are thicker in depth and hold back immense streams of ice coming from the heights of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the 1760 kilometers wide (1100 mile wide), 2700 meter high (9000 foot high) dome that sits atop continental rock.
No one has spotted signs of instability yet in the two giant shelves.
But scientists also worry about what Thomas calls the "back door" a stretch of Antarctic coast whose glaciers feed off the western ice sheet directly into the Amundsen Sea, or into small ice shelves on that sea.
"There's some indication of instability in the Amundsen Sea," Casassa said.
Casassa, Thomas and colleagues have watched the "back door" since the early 1990s, most recently via satellite tracking.
They reported in the journal Science last September that a half dozen glaciers there are now thinning and accelerating.
The big Pine Island glacier is carrying ice faster toward the sea as much as 298 kilometers (186 miles) inland, deep within the western ice sheet.
"The instability and changes are migrating inland," Casassa said.
"This could affect the whole of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, because the ice sheet 'feels' what is happening at the coast."
Glaciologists are quick to point out they've found no basis for fearing an imminent, massive collapse of ice into the southern seas.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a U.N. organized network of scientists, concluded in a 2001 assessment that the impact of global warming "will be realized slowly" in Antarctica.
Although scientists assume major change might take a millennium, much remains unknown about the links among ice, ocean and skies.
It isn't known, for example, how excess amounts of cold, fresh water from glaciers, pouring into the salty sea, will affect the ocean current that circles Antarctica from west to east a main driver of all the world's ocean currents, and hence of world climate.
Antarctica's own climate, meanwhile, may be verging on change.
Factors including the seasonal Antarctic "ozone hole" of recent decades are believed to have held temperatures in the interior stable while the world warmed.
But NASA climatologists recently reported that a computer model study indicates things may rapidly reverse toward warming in Antarctica, in part because an international ban on ozone destroying substances is expected to restore the ozone layer.
Drew Shindell of NASA said "there's a lot of room for improvement in the modeling" in upper atmosphere dynamics, for example, including the chemistry of ozone.
"We're trying to get that kind of modeling.
We have new computers, 10 times bigger," he said by telephone from his New York office.
In powerful computers, by satellite and on the Antarctic ice, the stepped up search for answers will go on.
Like others, Skvarca sees a need for a bigger, better coordinated international effort.
The Argentine scientist recalled the "premonitory" work of the late Ohio State University glaciologist John Mercer, who forecast in the 1970s that warming would cause the Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves to disintegrate, from north to south.
At the time, "nobody paid much attention," Skvarca said.
"Let's not wait 30 years more to see whether Larsen C and others disintegrate.
There's an urgent need for research now."
The collapse of a huge ice shelf in Antarctica in 2002 has no precedent in the past 11000 years, according to a study to be published on Thursday that points the finger at global warming.
Measuring some 3250 square kilometers (1250 sq. miles) in area and 220 metres (715 feet) thick, the Larsen B iceshelf broke away from the eastern Antarctic Peninsula in 2002, eventually disintegrating into giant icebergs.
By chance, a US led team of geologists had gathered a rich harvest of data around the iceshelf just before the spectacular collapse, including six cores that had been drilled into marine sediment.
The cores contain the remains of plankton and algae imbedded in layers of minerals, and their radiocarbon and oxygen isotopes provide clues about ice cover and climate change over the millennia.
The researchers, reporting in Nature, the British science weekly, say that since the end of the last Ice Age, some 11000 years ago, the iceshelf had been intact but had slowly thinned, by several dozen metres (several dozen feet).
Its coup de grace came from a recent but decades long rise in air temperature, they say.
"The modern collapse of the LIS B Larsen B iceshelf is a unique event within the Holocene," they write.
"The LIS B eventually thinned to the point where it succumbed to the prolonged period of regional warming now affecting the entire Antarctic Peninsula region."
The Holocene is the period of relatively balmy weather that followed the last Ice Age.
The research is the latest in a series of studies to sound the alarm about the effects of climate change in Antarctica, where the bulk of the world's freshwater is locked up.
The Antarctic Peninsula, which juts northwards out of West Antarctica, is considered a warming hot spot.
Over the past half century, temperatures in the peninsula have risen by around 2 C (3.6 F).
In recent years, the peninsula has lost ice shelves totalling more than 12500 sq. kms (4826 sq. miles), equivalent to four times the area of Luxembourg.
Of the 244 glaciers that drain inland ice and feed these shelves, 87 percent have fallen back since the mid 1950s, according to a British study published in April.
Global warming, also called the greenhouse effect, is caused by carbon gases mostly discharged by burning oil, gas and coal, that trap the Sun's heat.
But Earth's climate also goes through natural oscillations of warming and cooling, resulting in Ice Ages and the milder interglacial periods inbetween.
The new study does not say that man made global warming was responsible for the Larsen B's demise.
However, it refers to a steep rise in the temperatures over the past several decades, a phenomenon that climatologists concur was unleashed by fossil fuels.
From an airplane at 500 feet, all that is visible here is a vast white emptiness.
Ahead, a chalky plain stretches as far as the eye can see, the monotony broken only by a few gentle rises and the wrinkles created when new sheets of ice form.
Under the surface of that ice, though, profound and potentially troubling changes are taking place, and at a quickened pace.
With temperatures climbing in parts of Antarctica in recent years, melt water seems to be penetrating deeper and deeper into ice crevices, weakening immense and seemingly impregnable formations that have developed over thousands of years.
As a result, huge glaciers in this and other remote areas of Antarctica are thinning and ice shelves the size of American states are either disintegrating or retreating all possible indications of global warming.
Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey reported in December that in some parts of the Antarctic Peninsula hundreds of miles from here, large growths of grass are appearing in places that until recently were hidden under a frozen cloak.
"The evidence is piling up, everything fits," Robert Thomas, a glaciologist from NASA who is the lead author of a recent paper on accelerating sea level rise, said as the Chilean navy plane flew over the sea ice here on an unusually clear day late in November.
"Around the Amundsen Sea, we have surveyed a half dozen glaciers.
All are thinning, in some cases quite rapidly, and in each case, the ice shelf is also thinning."
The relationship between glaciers (essentially frozen rivers) and ice shelves (thick plates of ice protruding from the land and floating on the ocean) is complicated and not fully understood.
But scientists compare the spot where the "tongue" of a glacier flows to the sea in the form of an ice shelf to a cork in a bottle.
When the ice shelf breaks up, this can allow the inland ice to accelerate its march to the sea.
"By themselves, the tongue of the glacier or the cork in the bottle do not represent that much," said Claudio Teitelboim, the director of the Center for Scientific Studies, a private Chilean institution that is the partner of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in surveying the ice fields of Antarctica and Patagonia.
"But once the cork is dislodged, the contents of the bottle flow out, and that can generate tremendous instability."
Glaciologists also know that by itself, free floating sea ice does not raise the level of the sea, just as an ice cube in a glass of water does not cause an overflow as it melts.
But glaciers are different because they rest on land, and if that vast volume of ice slides into the sea at a high rate, this adds mass to the ocean, which in turn can raise the global sea level.
With flights over this and other areas of Antarctica, NASA and the Chilean center hope to help glaciologists and other scientists interested in climate change understand what is taking place on the frigid continent and why.
To do that, they need to compile data not only on ice thicknesses but also on the underlying geology of the region, information most easily obtained from the air.
The flights are taking place aboard a Chilean navy Orion P 3 plane that has been specially equipped with sophisticated instruments.
The devices include a laser imaging system that shoots 5000 pulses of light per second at the ground to map the ice surface, as well as ice penetrating radar to determine the depth of the ice sheets, a magnetometer and digital cameras.
For most parts of Antarctica, reliable records go back less than 50 years, and data from satellites and overflights like the ones going on here have been collected over only the past decade or so.
But that research, plus striking changes that are visible to the naked eye, all point toward the disturbance of climate patterns thought to have been in place for thousands of years.
In 1995, for instance, the Larsen A ice shelf disintegrated, followed in 1998 by the collapse of the nearby Wilkins ice shelf.
Over a 35 day period early in 2002, at the end of the Southern Hemisphere summer, the Larsen B ice shelf shattered, losing more than a quarter of its total mass and setting thousands of icebergs adrift in the Weddell Sea.
"The response time scale of ice dynamics is a lot shorter than we used to think it was," said Robert Bindschadler, a NASA scientist who is director of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Initiative.
"We don't know what the exact cause is, but what we observe going on today is likely to be what is also happening tomorrow."
Thus far, all of the ice shelves that have collapsed are on the Antarctic peninsula a collection of islands, mountain ranges and glaciers that jut northward toward Argentina and Chile that is "really getting hot, competing with the Yukon for the title of the fastest warming place on the globe," in the words of Eric Steig, a glaciologist who teaches at the University of Washington.
According to a recent study published in Geophysical Research Letters, the discharge rate of three important glaciers still remaining on the peninsula accelerated eightfold just from 2000 to 2003.
"Ice is thinning at the rate of tens of meters per year" on the peninsula, with glacier elevations in some places having dropped by as much as 124 feet in six months, it found.
But the narrow peninsula contains relatively little inland ice.
Glaciologists are more concerned that they are now beginning to detect similar signs closer to the South Pole, on the main body of the continent, where ice shelves are much larger and could contribute far more to sea level changes.
Of particular interest is this remote and almost inaccessible region known as "the weak underbelly of West Antarctica," where some individual ice shelves are as large as Texas or Spain and much of the land on which they rest lies under sea level.
"This is probably the most active part of Antarctica," said Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and the principal author of the Geophysical Research Letters paper.
"Glaciers are changing rapidly and increasingly discharging into the ocean, which contributes to sea level rise in a more significant way than any other part of Antarctica."
According to another paper, published in the journal Science in September, "the catchment regions of Amundsen Sea glaciers contain enough ice to raise sea level by 1.3 meters," or about 4 feet.
While the current sea level rise attributable to glacier thinning here is a relatively modest 0.2 millimeters a year, or about 10 percent of the total global increase, the paper noted that near the coast the process had accelerated and might continue to do so.
As a result, the most recent flights by NASA and the Chilean center have been directed over the Thurston Island and Pine Island zones of West Antarctica, near where the Bellinghausen and Amundsen seas come together.
The idea is to use the laser and radar readings being gathered to establish a base line for comparison, with measurements to be taken every two years or so.
"We're not sure yet how to connect what we see on the peninsula with what we observe going on further south, but both are very clearly dramatic and dynamic events," Bindschadler said.
"On the peninsula, large amounts of melt water are directly connected to disintegration of the ice shelf, but the actual mechanism in West Antarctica, whether melt water, a slippery hill or a firmer bedrock, is not yet clear.
Hence the need for more data."
The information being gathered here coincides with the recent publication of a report on accelerating climate change in the Arctic, an area that has been far more scrutinized than Antarctica.
That study, commissioned by the United States and seven other nations, found permafrost there to be thawing and glaciers and sea ice to be retreating markedly, raising new concerns about global warming and its impact.
"The Arctic has lots of land at high latitudes, and the presence of land masses helps snow melt off more quickly," Steig said.
"But there's not a lot of land to speak of in the high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere," making the search for an explanation of what is going on here even more complicated.
The hypotheses scientists offer for the causes of glacier and ice shelf thinning in Antarctica are varied.
Rising air, land and ocean temperatures or some combination have all been cited.
Some scientists have even proposed that a healing of the seasonal ozone hole over the South Pole and southernmost Chile, a phenomenon expected to take place in the next 50 years or so, could change the circulation of the atmosphere over the frozen continent in ways that could accelerate the thinning of Antarctic ice fields.
But even without that, the situation developing in Antarctica is already sobering, glaciologists agree.
The data being collected in West Antarctica and on the peninsula farther north make that obvious, they say, though the degree to which that should be cause for concern around the rest of the planet will become clear only with more research.
"If Antarctica collapses, it will have a major effect on the whole globe," Rignot cautioned.
"Nature is playing a little experiment with us," he said, "showing us what could happen if the plug were to be removed."
A Chinese scientist predicted that the icecap of the Arctic area in summer will totally disappear if the current melting speed remains unchanged.
Zhang Zhanhai, director of Polar Research Institute of China, said that the melting rate of Arctic ice is "alarming" with the ice area shrinking by 10 percent and the thickness by 42 percent over the past 30 years.
"If this situation keeps unchanged, the world should be prepared for a more sizzling summer," Zhang warned at the ongoing seventh Arctic Science Summit Week (ASSW), being held in Kunming, capital city of southwest China's Yunnan Province, from April 18 to 24.
China is a Northern Hemisphere country with sophisticated natural and environmental variations and any changes take place in Arctic area will directly affect the climate of China, experts say.
Zhang said, the cold front that affects China mainly comes from Siberia, but the source of the cold front is Arctic.
"To some extent, Arctic is an 'air conditioner' of countries in the North Hemisphere," Zhang said.
"With more ice melting and the shrinking of permafrost, the Northern Hemisphere countries will experience more awful weather," said Zhang.
The direct influence of Arctic on the climate in Northern Hemisphere countries has remained a top concern of experts attending the summit.
Launched in 1999, the summit has become a platform where experts from various countries exchange views and Arctic research achievements, covering influence of human activities, ocean ecology, climatic changes, mechanism of polar climate formation, among others.
China has contributed many efforts to study the polar regions, including the sporadic observation activities since 1990s and the latest establishment of Yellow River observation site in Norway in July, 2004.
The melting of Arctic ice will not only be a sign of threat, it is also a good news, Zhang said.
"It is at least a good news for ocean shipping," said Zhang. "
We can cut the journey by one third by traveling directly to the Atlantic via the Bering Strait Gateway and via the Arctic Ocean."
Leaders of the Arctic region's indigenous people on Friday urged European countries to step up the fight against global warming, saying it is threatening their societies, economies and cultures.
The eight nation Arctic Council said the annual average amount of sea ice around the North Pole has decreased about 8 percent in 30 years because of global warming fueled by greenhouse gas emissions.
"There is some tough sledding ahead to make the rest of the cuts in greenhouse gases that will be needed," said Chief Gary Harrison, a council member, at a meeting in Copenhagen.
He urged European nations to lower emissions beyond what's required under the Kyoto Protocol on climate change.
The protocol, which took effect in February, commits participating industrialized nations to reduce their combined greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.
The treaty has been ratified by at least 140 nations.
The council believes temperatures in the Arctic will increase 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2080.
"To some, that's just the difference between putting a jacket on and off," said Clive Tesar, of the council's Indigenous Peoples' Secretariat.
"But 3 degrees is a major change for the ecosystem, for animals, for plants, for peoples that have adapted to a particular temperature."
The softening permafrost has already driven some polar animals further north.
There are fears that polar bears and some seal species could face extinction in just decades because of global warming.
Global warming also has an impact on infrastructures that are built on permafrost.
"If it stays hard like concrete, that is not a problem, you can build anything you like on it," Tesar said.
"But it starts to melt (and) creates a little bit of a problem.
Houses start to lean, pipelines rupture and roads fall apart."
The indigenous leaders were in Berlin earlier this week and will travel to Brussels, Belgium, on Sunday.
"We are asking each country in the world to examine if it is truly doing its part to slow climate change," said Larisa Abryutina of the Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North, which is part of the Arctic Council.
The United States, the only Arctic region country that has not adopted the Kyoto treaty, says the restrictions are flawed and could hurt its economy.
The Arctic region is home to about 4 million people, including more than 30 different indigenous groups.
Created in 1996, the Arctic Council which comprises Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States is a regional partnership for sustainable development.
They stood and gawked at the great blue mass of shrinking ice.
Behold: a frozen landscape giving it up to a midnight sunset.
The scene at the receding edge of the Exit Glacier in Kenai Fjords National Park in Alaska was part festive gathering, part nature tour with an apocalyptic edge.
Dressed in tank tops and shorts beachwear, in fact on this freakishly warm day in early June, people moved ever closer to the rope line near the glacier as it shied away, practically groaning and melting before their eyes.
A product of the late ice age, the glacier looked old and tired on this hot day.
There was a sense of loss, some people said, at watching this giant recoil.
There were oohs and aahs but also more hushed tones, expressions of fear that the big land was somehow diminished, a little less wild.
Just a few years ago, the spot where these tourists stood, on dry ground marked by Park Service signs, had been under ice.
Alaska is changing by the hour.
From the far north, where higher seas are swamping native villages, to the tundra around Fairbanks, where melting permafrost is forcing some roads and structures to buckle in what looks like a cartoon version of a hangover, to the rivers of ice receding from inlets, warmer temperatures are remaking the Last Frontier State.
That transformation was particularly apparent at the visitor center here, where rangers were putting the finishing touches on a display that sought to explain the changing landscape of the country's northernmost state.
The sign said, "Glimpses of an Ice Age past.
Laboratory of climate change today," and it explained how the Exit Glacier has been shrinking over the years, and what scientists are learning as the state heats up.
Out in the fjords, kayakers paddled into bays newly opened by other receding glaciers.
They came to see the ice, a tour guide explained, to paddle around something that had been moving toward a tidewater destiny for thousands of years.
And many of them were in a hurry.
Glacial pace, in Alaska, no longer means slow.
"Things are melting pretty fast around here," said Jim Ireland, the chief ranger for Kenai Fjords.
Climate change, he said, "has become one of the major new themes for this park."
In ambition, in the scale of its scenic extremes, in the pure size and wonder of its fish and wildlife, Alaska has never been anything less than flamboyant.
It is, after all, more than two times the size of Texas, with a shoreline, more than 33000 miles, that exceeds that of all other states combined.
And as Alaska morphs through a period of warmer weather, it is doing so with characteristic extravagance.
The old Alaska, the Alaska of forbidden expanses and adrenaline surging encounters with brawnier ends of the food chain, still exists of course.
But a larger drama of this land losing some of its icy inheritance is playing out as well.
The sea level edge of the Exit Glacier, just outside the town of Seward and one of the most visited bodies of ice in the north, has receded by nearly 1000 feet over the last 10 years, park rangers say.
In Prince William Sound and farther south in Glacier Bay National Park, where the cruise ship industry does a thriving business based on active walls of ice, many glaciers have pulled their toes out of the water and shriveled up the valleys.
This process has created another attraction: the instant landscape.
Take away the ice, add rain and sunshine to the debris left behind and, presto, Stage 1 of creation.
To some visitors who fear that global warming is to blame for the accelerated pace of change, there is a sense of urgency in their travel planning.
They seem to be fearful that if they don't get to Alaska soon, they will never see the full glory of the state's frozen magnificence.
"One of the things we hear a lot from people is that they want to see Alaska before it's gone," said Hugh Rose, a tour guide, geologist and photographer who lives in Fairbanks.
"The melting, the warmer temperatures, the changing patterns of wildlife and the land they've become huge topics of conversation among guides and our clients."
Of course, Alaska is not going anywhere, at least not right away.
About 4 percent of the state is ice.
One glacier, the Malaspina, is larger than Rhode Island, and another, the Harding Icefield, which feeds the Exit Glacier, is nearly half that size.
If all of Alaska's glaciers were joined in one mass, it would be bigger than 10 of the states.
But the Great Land is definitely getting warmer.
Last year was abnormally hot in the usually wet and cool southeastern part of the state, where cruise ships ply the Inside Passage.
Anchorage, Fairbanks, Nome and Juneau all posted their warmest summers on record.
More wildfires burned in 2004 than any other year on file.
And by early May of this year, the woods were ablaze on the Kenai Peninsula, and the preternaturally quirky residents of Homer were gardening in cutoffs at a time when snow was still falling in Detroit and Boston.
This year, Rose noticed something odd during the annual spring birding trek he leads to the Copper River Delta, famous for its rich, high priced wild salmon runs.
He takes people to the delta to watch masses of western sandpipers that have migrated north from winter havens in Central and South America.
The birds, and people who pay to watch them, have brought an infusion of tourism cash to the fishing village of Cordova, which highlights the migration with an annual shorebird festival.
The event has traditionally been held on the second weekend in May, last year it was moved to the first weekend of the month.
"There used to be 100000 birds on the second weekend in May," said Rose.
"Now you'll miss most of them if you don't arrive earlier."
The question of exactly how much warmer Alaska is than "normal" and whether it is part of human caused changes in the temperature brought on by increased greenhouse gases or something natural and cyclical can start a decent bar fight in any fishing harbor.
"It is probable the last decade was warmer than any other" since records have been kept, the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment reported on Nov 24, 2004.
The study is a project of nations including Denmark, Canada and the United States.
The Bush administration, which has been cautious about blaming global warming for any Alaskan changes, cites rising spring temperatures, loss of sea and glacial ice, melting permafrost and conversion of some parts of the soggy tundra into brushy wetlands among the changes taking place.
But to many Alaskans, global warming is not an abstraction or a theory.
At least four native villages in the far north may have to move inland or to higher ground to avoid being swept away by erosion from the sea a consequence, the villagers say, of early melting sea ice that contributes to shore erosion.
The melting ice may also affect polar bears, and whales, who live off the sea life beneath the ice.
None of this has deterred people from coming to Alaska.
If anything, say many guides and tour operators, warming temperatures have brought more people, and the Alaska Travel Industry Association is projecting a strong year, surpassing last year's 1.45 million visitors.
And while travel industry officials say they are not exactly marketing the warmer temperatures around a "See Alaska Now" campaign, they say some travelers are driven by concern about the fate of the Great Land in a warmer world.
"Our clients are really interested in this," said John Page, who runs Sunny Cove Sea Kayaking Co. in Seward.
"Everyone wants to know: Is the ice retreating because of global warming?
How's this going to change Alaska?"
For tourists, it can mean a thrill at seeing a landscape more dynamic than any place on earth global warming on hyperspeed! or disappointment that something so wild and massive is, well, shrinking.
Both reactions were evident at Portage Lake, about 50 miles south of Anchorage.
Tour buses packed the parking lot of the big, well staffed Begich, Boggs Visitor Center.
This is where people come by the thousands to see Portage Glacier, one of the most accessible of Alaska's frozen attractions.
Except, you can no longer see Portage Glacier from the visitor center.
It has disappeared.
The most persistent question to rangers at the station was: Dude, where did Portage Glacier go?
A display inside showed that just 11 years ago, the glacier descended down to the end of the lake.
But now it is around a distant corner and at the back of the lake, completely out of sight from the center.
A video featured a Forest Service scientist, Kristine Crossen, who explained that the glacier had been retreating about 165 feet a year.
"We have good evidence that the climate is warming in Alaska," she says.
Visitors were perplexed.
Gordon Middleton drove up to Portage Lake in his camper, from his home in Anacortes, Wash.
He is retired from a life on factory floors and fishing boats.
For him, ice is the draw.
"I've been watching glaciers so long I'm called the Ice Man by some of my friends," said Middleton.
He aimed his camera across the lake from a roadside perch and zoomed in, looking for Portage Glacier.
"It's supposed to be there," he said, pointing to a shoreline of rocky moraine, the detritus left behind by retreating ice.
"But I don't see anything."
Virtually every visitor center built around a glacier or a blue wall hugging a mountain cliff has its landmarks to warmer temperatures.
Just outside of Juneau, the Mendenhall Glacier, which is about 12 miles in length, has gradually pulled away from near the parking lot and up the lake.
It is still a prime visitor site for people who are bused from cruise ships in port.
But for some cruise passengers who have seen the glacier before, the changes are stunning.
"I saw the Mendenhall Glacier 25 years ago, and it has really pulled back since then," said Mark Stringer, who is from Arizona and was visiting Alaska by cruise ship.
"But you know, this is a dynamic process.
It's a blip in time.
We don't know what's going to happen."
In Glacier Bay National Park, the ice has been shrinking since at least the time of Capt. George Vancouver's visit, more than 200 years ago.
What are now bays filled with whale watching kayakers and iceberg viewing cruise passengers were full of glaciers in the late 1700s, officials say.
And what was once bare rock at the edge of the ice to Captain Vancouver's crew is now part of a lush rain forest.
But the pace of ice age retreat has greatly accelerated in recent years.
Government photos show that Muir Glacier, one of the park's prime attractions, has receded by more than five miles in the last 30 years.
"The big story around here is the retreat of Muir Glacier," said Dave Nemeth, the park's chief of concessions.
"But all around the park, there are constant changes going on."
For many amateur photographers on a first visit to Alaska, the money shot is a glacier calving into the water.
And with these tidewater glaciers disappearing from places like Prince William Sound and Kenai Fjords, it has prompted some urgent travel advisories for people to hurry before those shots disappear.
"If you ever wanted to take an Alaskan cruise to see glaciers, do it sooner rather than later for the best views," wrote Bob Martin, who runs a Web site called the Inquisitive Traveler.
But people in the cruise ship industry say it is hard to gauge exactly how many visitors are coming to Alaska now out of a sense of concern that Alaska is melting away.
"We know glaciers are one of the top five reasons why people travel to Alaska," said Noel DeChambeau, a marketing director at Holland America, the cruise line company.
"They want to see natural wonders.
And I don't get a sense that the natural wonders are going away any time soon."
But DeChambeau did note that Holland America's overland trip to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which Congress and President Bush plan to open to oil drilling, sold out early this year.
Other tour operators also report a surge of interest in travel within the Arctic Circle.
"Some people are clueless or they say, 'Cool your summers are getting longer,"' said Rose, the Fairbanks guide who leads tours to the Arctic.
"But for every one of them, we get a client genuinely concerned that Alaska is changing too quickly, and they want to see it while they can."
In the town of Seward, which seems to have a disproportionate number of people who dine with baseball hats emblazoned with a fishing hook and the slogan "Bite Me," residents are of two minds about the warming weather.
Up at Exit Glacier, a man who told everyone his name was Pete and said he lived in Seward was holding forth, telling people that just five years ago he could reach out and touch the glacier from where he stood, a good 300 yards from the edge of the ice now.
Meanwhile, back in town, tour guides were doing a brisk business during a week when people were wearing Hawaiian shirts and lathering on the sunscreen.
"I've lived here 22 years, and the changes I've seen are tremendous," said Page, the Seward kayaking guide.
"The summers are much warmer and sunnier.
We see things like white sided dolphins, which don't normally appear in these waters.
It certainly has not hurt business.
But on a planetary level, I'm concerned."
Other Alaskans are trying to take the long view enjoying the rush of visitors to see a land shaking off much of its frozen past.
"I'm 64 years old, so I'm not too worried it's all going to melt in my time," said Charlie Clements, who runs the Blue Heron B&B, in Gustavus, just outside Glacier Bay National Park.
"But I have noticed a lot of changes.
We aren't getting as much snow.
And the summers, they've been really warm."
His bed and breakfast, which is planted in one of the wettest places on the planet, within miles of some of the world's biggest glaciers, now has an added feature: a sunroom.
It is no longer a joke.
A two week conference on the Antarctic, focusing on environmental, climate change and tourism issues, opened on Monday with representatives of 50 governments, researchers and experts, the Swedish hosts said.
The conference, which runs to June 17, comes amid fresh warnings from scientists about the effect of climate change on Antarctica, the fifth largest continent in the world, which contains more than 90 percent of the world's ice.
Sweden hopes that the meeting will result in a special protocol on responsibility and insurance in the case of major accidents in the Antarctic, such as oil spills.
"It seems that there are great expectations for our discussions," Swedish environment minister Lena Sommestad told the TT news agency on Monday.
Other topics are the environmental impact of increasing tourism in the Antarctic.
"We believe that it is important for people to visit the Antarctic, but it is also important that we are aware of the consequences," Sommestad said.
Recognizing the special role the Antarctic plays for the world's climate, a treaty was signed by 12 nations in 1959 stipulating that it is in "the interest of all mankind that Antarctica shall continue for ever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord".
The treaty now has 44 signatories, of which 27 are full members controlling the decision making process.
A number of countries, including Argentina, Chile and Britain, claim territory in Antarctica as their own, but the treaty calls for sovereignty issues to be put aside, and they will not be discussed at the conference.
Last month, scientists again sounded an alarm bell on the effect of global warming on Antarctica, saying that more than 200 coastal glaciers are in retreat because of higher temperatures.
Of the 244 marine glaciers that drain inland ice on the Antarctic peninsula, a region previously identified as vulnerable to global warming, 87 percent have fallen back over the last half century, according to research by British experts.
It is unclear whether the man made "greenhouse effect", caused by the burning of fossil fuels, is entirely to blame, they said.
If even a small part of this cap melts, rising sea levels could drown low lying island states, cities and deltas, they warned.
British police said Friday they were "aware" of an arrest in Egypt in connection with the investigation into last week's London bombings.
"We are aware of an arrest made in Cairo but are not prepared to discuss if we may or may not wish to interview (the person) in connection with this investigation," a spokeswoman for London's Metropolitan Police told AFP.
According to US based ABC News, the person arrested is the alleged bomb builder behind the July 7 attacks on three Underground subway trains and a double decker bus which killed at least 54 people and injured some 700.
The final death toll from the July 7 London bombings still stands at 56, but might still rise due to the "very difficult" scenes at the blast sites, interior minister Charles Clarke said Wednesday.
All 56 people confirmed as having died when bombs exploded on three London Underground subway trains and a bus had now been formally identified, Clarke told the House of Commons.
"It is possible that the total may rise as the police investigation of the very difficult scenes continues," he added.
Forty four victims of the London subway and bus bombings remained in hospitals Friday, with nine reported in intensive care.
Among the hospitals treating the injured were the Royal London Hospital in east London, with 14 patients including five in intensive care, and University College Hospital in central London, with 11 including four in intensive care.
The British authorities on Tuesday began removing a London Underground car which was hit in one of the four bombings carried out nearly two weeks ago.
British television stations showed the car being lifted by a crane from the track near Edgware Road Underground station and moved toward a flatbed truck.
It had been winched out of the tunnel at the station where the explosion happened on July 7, killing seven people, police said.
At least 56 people were killed in the attacks on three subway trains and one bus.
The sealed car will be transported to a secure police compound for further forensic examination, the police said.
The wreckage, weighing around 20 tonnes, is all that remains of the carriage second from the front of the targeted train.
The bomb was located in a standing area near the first set of double doors, police have said.
Since the explosion, police have been working to remove all the bodies of the victims before the car could be taken away.
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the removal was being carried out by contractors for Transport for London.
It signals that the forensic search of the scene of the bombing is nearing an end.
The spokesman said: "Until today it has been a full crime scene so everything has remained as it was.
There has been removal of bodies.
"They have pulled the carriage out of the tunnel.
It's on an open spot.
They will drop a winch down and drop it (the car) onto the back of the flatbed lorry.
It will be moved to a location for further forensic evidence."
He said the damage was not so extensive that the carriage was unrecognisable.
Here are the last known movements of four men suspected of blowing themselves up on three London subway trains and a bus in Britain's worst terror attack that left at least 52 people dead last week.
The police have yet to confirm officially the details of the bombings but the British press has drawn up a chilling account of Thursday's plot.
Three of the suspects named by newspapers as Hasib Hussein, 19, Shehzad Tanweer, 20 or 22, and Mohammed Sadique Khan, 30 drove from their homes in West Yorkshire, northern England, to Luton, northwest of London, where they met their fourth accomplice.
All four were British of Pakistani origin.
They left their rented car at a station carpark in Luton, each carrying a rucksack laden with explosives.
At about 7:48 am (0648 GMT) the suspects caught a commuter train to King's Cross station in London, which was due to arrive at 8:20 am.
At about 8:30 am (0730 GMT) they were at King's Cross where they were captured on closed circuit television.
They were reportedly chatting casually, carrying military style heavy rucksacks.
One of the alleged bombers, Hussein carried his in front of him and was wearing a distinctive jumper.
Without elaborate farewells, the group split up.
At around 8:50 am (0750 GMT), three bombs rip through London Underground subway trains near Aldgate station to the east, Edgware Road station to the west and King's Cross station in the north of the city centre.
All the affected lines pass through King's Cross.
Tanweer reportedly detonated the Edgware Road bomb, which left seven people dead.
Khan is thought to be behind the Aldgate bomb, which left another seven dead and the unnamed bomber triggered the explosion near King's Cross, which killed at least 25.
At 9:47 am (0847 GMT), a bomb explodes on the Number 30 double decker bus in Tavistock Square, central London.
Hussein is believed to have caused the explosion, which killed 13 people.
Shortly after 10:00 pm (2100 GMT), Hussein's mother, unable to reach her son on his mobile after the blasts, called a help line to report him missing.
This call led the police to identify the suspects and triggered a series of raids on their homes in and around Leeds on Tuesday.
The intensive hunt for the perpetrators of the London bombings dramatically gathered pace Tuesday, centering on a gritty industrial city in the north of England.
Five premises in Leeds home to a large Muslim population of south Asian origin were raided by police armed with warrants issued under the Terrorism Act 2000, police said.
Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Ian Blair called the operation in the West Yorkshire city "significant," as Sky News television reported that several arrests had been carried out.
Citing police sources, Sky News added that four of the bombers were among the 52 confirmed dead in Thursday's bombing of three Underground subway trains and a double decker bus.
There was no immediate confirmation of the reports from police, but there was little doubt that the investigation into the bloodiest attack on British soil since World War II was moving fast.
Closer to London, police sealed off a train station and parking lot in Luton, northwest of the capital, to recover a car that might offer up clues into the bombings.
Islamic extremists, possibly with links to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, are believed to have carried out the bombings.
With daily life in London virtually back to normal, police chief Blair warned in a BBC interview against complacency, saying: "Another attack is likely.
There's no doubt about that."
Fifty two people were confirmed dead, and some 700 injured, from the bombs that went off at the peak of morning rush hour Thursday on three London subway trains and a double decker bus.
The death toll was certain to rise, with police liaison officers assisting a total of 74 families.
Police released the names of two more of the victims, taking the total of formal identifications so far to five.
Meanwhile, the US embassy said that a ban since Friday on US air force personnel entering London in the wake of the bombings had been lifted following bitter criticism from police, politicians and tourism officials.
Some 10000 US servicemen at two air bases in the east of England had been ordered to keep out of London, despite appeals for life in London to resume as quickly as possible to make clear that Britons will not be cowed by terrorists.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Monday that no effort would be spared to find the bombers, whom he associated with Al Qaeda network the group behind the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001.
"We are united in our determination that our country will not be defeated by such terror," he told parliament.
Dozens of people in London remain missing and feared dead, as the grim task of recovering human remains from the tangled wreckage of subway trains continued amidst hellish conditions deep under ground.
Police set up a vast temporary mortuary in a military barracks just east of the city centre where next of kin were being taken to identify victims.
According to press reports Tuesday, the bomb gutted Number 30 bus in which 13 were killed was proving the most productive hunting ground for detectives.
"There are two bodies which have to be examined in great detail because they appear to have been holding the bomb or sitting on top of it," a senior police source told The Times newspaper.
The Financial Times newspaper said progress had been made toward naming the individual suspected of being responsible for the bus blast.
Four bombers were among those killed in Thursday's attacks on three Underground subway trains and a double decker bus in London, Sky News television reported Tuesday, quoting police sources.
Two men were arrested Wednesday on suspicion of having set fire to a mosque in northwest England two days after the London bombings, police said.
One man had to be rescued by firefighters when the blaze broke out at the Shahjalal Mosque in Birkenhead, Merseyside, in the early hours of July 9, two days after the bomb attacks on three subway trains and a bus in London.
It is feared that the blaze may have been started in retaliation for the London bombings, which claimed the lives of at least 56 people.
"A 28 year old man and a 29 year old man, who both come from Birkenhead, have been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life," a Merseyside Police spokeswoman said, adding that the two were being questioned.
One man has already been charged with arson in connection with the incident.
Stephen Wynne, 27, from Birkenhead, appeared before Wirral Magistrates last Friday and was remanded in custody to appear before Liverpool Crown Court on August 4.
The same weekend police also reported arson attacks on mosques in Leeds, Belvedere, and Telford.
The number of confirmed dead in the July 7 bombings in London rose to 56 on Monday, police said.
There were no immediate details about the 56th victim of Britain's worst terrorist attacks.
Fifty one of the dead have been identified since the suicide bombings on three Underground trains and a double decker bus, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.
According to an updated break down of the victims issued by the police, 27 people died on a subway train between King's Cross and Russell Square stations, seven passed away when a bomb exploded on a train at Edgware Road station and eight died on the train between Liverpool Street and Aldgate stations.
A further 14 people were killed, including the suicide bomber, when a bomb tore the roof off a double decker bus in Tavistock Square, towards the centre of the capital.
Some 700 people were injured in the bombings, with a handful still in hospital in serious condition.
Police said earlier that they did not expect the death toll to rise significantly.
Police raised the official death count in the London bombings from 52 to 53 on Thursday.
The victims died in three explosions on subway trains and on a double decker bus, all carried out by suicide bombers, police said.
If the terrorists' main aim in London last week was simply to kill people with bombs on public transport, their attacks were a grim success.
If the plan was to sow fear and panic, they failed utterly.
Since Thursday's four bomb blasts on three subway trains and a bus, which killed at least 52 people in total, many have remarked about how quickly, and with how little fuss, people in the British capital resumed everyday life.
According to one claim of responsibility posted on the Internet, the attacks left "Britain burning in fear, terror, and fright".
This was far from the truth: though harrowing, the well rehearsed plan to evacuate casualties from London Underground system and the wrecked bus worked quickly and without chaos.
For most of Thursday, central London had virtually no public transport, but workers accepted the inconvenience with a shrug, many making the long trek home on foot.
By Friday, much of the Underground system was operating again while bus routes were back to normal.
By the weekend, theatres had re opened and on Sunday tens of thousands of people gathered without apparent fear outside Buckingham Palace to mark the 60th anniversary of World War II.
The swift return to normality was in contrast with the experiences of New York and Madrid after their own admittedly more devastating terror attacks on September 11, 2001 and March 11 last year respectively.
Many commentators have pointed to the fact that London is no stranger to bombs, even terrorist ones.
From the 1970s onwards, the British capital was a regular target for the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the paramilitary group seeking an end to London's rule of Northern Ireland.
The attacks although nowhere near as deadly as that of last week continued until Northern Ireland's 1998 Good Friday peace deal.
London also prides itself on the so called "Blitz spirit", an attitude of phlegmatic self reliance formed in the dark days of 1940 and 1941 when German bombers pounded the city night after night, killing many thousands.
"London is very used to terrorism.
London had to deal with the IRA bombings for a number of years," said Stephen Clarke from the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College, part of London University.
"People are still very much hold onto the World War II spirit.
People want to honour the memory of those who lived during the war, and the Blitz in particular.
"That's the British spirit: we will not be put down by anyone or anything.
It's a very interesting psyche."
Additionally, Clarke added, Londoners had been "expecting a lot worse something like a dirty bomb, or bio terrorism, or a bigger bomb, or more bombs."
Another key factor in shaping the city's response was that so much of the carnage was hidden from view in the subway system, added Professor Stephen Graham, an expert on urban living at the University of Durham.
"Even now, there very little to see.
No images.
The very fact that the attacks were underground means that they almost have to be imagined.
In 9/11, the visual aspect was overpowering," he said.
But London also had its own defiant ethos, Graham added, shown in Londoners' business as usual reaction.
"It reflects a very strong determination not to have fear change the city," he said.
"We don't want to allow fear, which is the object of the attacks, to undermine what for many people is so special about London a global city where 200 languages are spoken."
British Prime Minister Tony Blair Thursday left the Group of Eight summit by helicopter to be briefed on the attacks in London, but the G8 summit will continue.
Britain's Home Secretary Charles Clarke confirmed that there were four explosions in central London on Thursday.
Speaking at the House of Commons, Clarke said three were on subway trains and the fourth was on a bus.
"We do not know who or what organizations are responsible for these terrible criminal acts," the home secretary said.
Latest reports said at least 10 people have been killed in the explosions and 185 injured in a wave of apparently coordinated bomb attacks across the British capital.
London's police chief said on Friday there was still no evidence that Thursday's terror attacks on the capital had been carried out by suicide bombers.
"We have absolutely nothing to suggest this was a suicide bombing attack although nothing at this stage to rule that out," Head of London metropolitan police Ian Blair told a press conference.
London's underground stations were hit by four bomb attacks at the rush hour on Thursday morning, which killed at least 50 people and injured 700.
The attacks, the deadliest ever carried out on London in peacetime, coincided with a summit of the Group of Eight in Gleneagles, Scotland.
Blair said efforts were still being made to establish the precise number of deaths from the blasts on three subway trains and one double decker bus.
Police said on Thursday that 35 people died on subway trains.
Assistant Commissioner Andy Hayman said forensic investigations suggested each one of the devices used in the attacks had probably contained less than 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) of high explosives.
Hayman said that the explosive devices, due to their small sizes, could have been carried to the explosion sites with backpacks.
"We do believe that each device put on the Tube trains was put on the floor of the carriages," Hayman said.
The police commissioner also said it was possible that an active terror cell was still intact and capable of another attack.
"We must remain vigilant," he said.
British police are on the verge of identifying one person they believe was involved in the bomb attacks which killed at least 52 people in London, a report said Tuesday.
The Financial Times, which cited an unnamed European official involved in international efforts to find the bombers, said progress had been made towards naming who was responsible for a blast on a bus on Thursday morning.
The bus explosion was one of four co ordinated bombings, the others on London Underground subway trains, which caused carnage in the morning rush hour.
"I think we are going to see photographs of one or more suspects being posted within days," the official told the paper.
Separately, The Times newspaper reported that forensic pathologists are paying particularly close attention to two bodies found inside the wrecked bus to see whether one of them might have been the bomber.
"There are two bodies which have to be examined in great detail because they appear to have been holding the bomb or sitting on top of it," a "senior police source" told the paper.
"One of those might turn out to be the bomber."
Some experts have speculated that the bus bomb might have gone off accidentally as the terrorist carried it, possibly to another Underground station.
According to The Times, a single bomb maker using military grade explosives was most likely responsible for manufacturing all the bombs used in the attacks.
Similar components have been found by police at all four bomb sites, the newspaper said without citing a source.
Investigators believe that the materials used to make the rucksack based bombs were manufactured using smuggled, military grade explosives, possibly brought in from the Balkans, the paper said.
"The nature of the explosives appears to be military, which is very worrying," Superintendent Christophe Chaboud, head of France's anti terrorism police, who is helping the London inquiry, was quoted as saying.
On Saturday London's Metropolitan Police confirmed that the explosives used in the blasts were most likely "not home made", but said it remained to be seen whether they were commercial or military in origin.
The terror attacks on London killed more than 50 people but an unknown number of bodies still lie in the underground railway, London's police chief said Friday.
"We now know that there are more than 50 fatalities," Metropolitan Police Commissioner Ian Blair told a news conference.
"There is great difficulty in deciding or determining how many fatalities because two of the scenes are very difficult in terms of recovery," he said.
"One is the bus because of the nature of the explosion and more acutely the tube train at Russell Square (subway station in central London) continues to hold a number of bodies.
"We don't know how many are there."
A total of 350 people were treated for light injuries at the scene.
Another 350 had been taken to hospital, of whom 100 were kept in overnight.
Twenty two people were still in serious and critical conditions, he said.
One person had died in hospital during the night.
Blair said the fact that an unknown number of bodies had not yet been retrieved should not be taken as a suggestion that the death toll could climb above 100.
"It's yet to be the case for us to get near the carriage.
There is a risk of the tunnel being unsafe.
I ask everyone's patience as we progress this matter," Assistant Commissioner Andy Hayman told the same news conference.
"It would be wholly unwise and could inhibit a successful prosecution if we rushed this stage," he said.
Hayman said each bomb likely contained less than 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) of explosives.
In their attack on the subway system, the attackers likely placed the bombs on floor of the train carriages, he said.
The subway tunnel between King's Cross and Russell Square is one of several "deep tubes" bored through London's bedrock and clay more than a century ago: 70 feet down, 12 feet in diameter and reinforced with iron rings, the single track tunnel affords just inches of clearance for trains.
On Thursday, the tunnel intensified the impact of a bomb containing about 10 pounds of high explosives, sending its force punching through the cars like a blast down the barrel of a shotgun.
It was the deadliest of the four bomb blasts in London last week, at least 21 people died on the train.
In the days since, dozens of recovery workers in heavy white protective suits have gone in time and again, entering a nightmarish scene of mangled remains, twisted metal and hellish temperatures and even an infestation of rats.
Crammed tight against the walls and wreckage, the searchers have crawled carefully, inches at a time, to avoid disturbing evidence while they try to recover body parts.
By late Sunday, they pulled out the last of the visible remains of the 49 people known to have died in the bombings.
But even then their job may not have been finished: The police say more remains might be obscured, because some people may have been blown out the front of the train and then run over as it skidded to a halt.
The bomb exploded in the lead car moments after the train pulled out of the King's Cross station, blowing apart the car and making it impossible to reach the dead and injured from the rear.
Recovery teams have had to work from the Russell Square station, ferrying people and equipment in and human remains out more than a third of a mile on a battery operated trolley recently built for use in the tunnels in case of a chemical attack.
Deputy Chief Constable Andy Trotter of the British Transport Police said the recovery was hampered by the heat and stillness of the air.
Temperatures are about 120 degrees, kept hot by intense lights, heavy equipment and lingering heat from the blast.
The tunnel has been sealed at either end of the accident site to stop the stench from the bodies from leaking into the other subway lines that meet at King's Cross station.
Trotter said the crews working in the tunnel were wearing heavy boots, gloves and helmets, as well as face masks because of the risk of asbestos particles in the air from the train's brakes.
"It's very hot and very dusty and extremely grim," Trotter said.
London Mayor Ken Livingstone, urging people to "carry on" as normal, rode the Underground to work on Monday, four days after bomb attacks on the British capital's transit system killed at least 52 people.
"We are going to work.
We carry on our lives.
We don't let a small group of terrorists change the way we live," the mayor said as he boarded the Jubilee Line at Willesden Green station, northwest London, bound for City Hall.
Asked whether people should try to forget about Thursday's bomb attack, Livingstone who often uses public transport replied: "We carry on our lives.
I don't think we ever stop thinking about last week."
Later, Livingstone opened the London Memorial Garden, established in the city centre as a memorial to the victims of the terror blasts.
Before laying white lilies in a solemn ceremony with dignitaries and religious leaders, Livingstone wrote in the book of condolences: "The city will endure.
It is the future of our world tolerance and change."
A member of Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour Party, Livingstone is mayor of western Europe's biggest city, with a population of more than seven million.
"A force much greater than I can express will defeat them (the bombers)," Livingstone wrote in London's Evening Standard newspaper on Monday.
"It is not even the force of seven million Londoners acting last Thursday in a way that inspires such pride.
"It is because on this matter seven million Londoners speak for more than five billion members of humanity.
"It is for that reason that those who came to kill and maim us at random have no chance of winning.
None."
One of the biggest manhunts in British police annals is under way to find the perpetrators of Thursday's bomb attacks on three Underground trains and a double decker bus.
Public transit was running as close to normal as possible Monday, with services restricted only on the lines stricken by the bombings.
Passengers returned to the city's subway trains and buses Friday, giving London some sense of normality, even as police announced that the death toll from Thursday's bombing attacks had reached at least 50.
Police also said that an unknown number of bodies still lay in the ruins of a subway car trapped in a darkened tunnel on the system's Piccadilly Line.
The tunnel was made unsafe, they said, by damage from the bomb blast there.
London's perpetually busy streets, emptied since the attacks that blew apart three subway cars and a double decker bus, were busy again, though the legendary traffic jams were eased by some people deciding to take the day off.
There was still plenty of grieving to do.
In scenes reminiscent of the attacks on the United States on Sept 11, 2001, and in Madrid, Spain, on March 11, 2004, relatives and friends of the missing searched hospitals, posted fliers and took to the airwaves begging for information.
Officials from Scotland Yard did not disclose how many of the dead remain unidentified, but they were more than a few.
Police said they were not even certain how many bodies remained unretrieved.
And the explosion on the bus was so severe it took more than a full day merely to determine the number of people killed by it: 13.
Authorities said 22 of the 700 people injured remained in critical condition.
Sir Ian Blair, commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, said that investigators were committed to finding the attackers, and he promised the most extensive investigation and manhunt in the department's history.
Investigators have said they do not know who they are looking for or how many suspects.
They said they have begun to review streams of video shot by some of the hundreds of cameras that record activity on subway platforms and streets around London.
Forensic evidence indicates that the bombs each contained less than 10 pounds of high explosives the Madrid bombs weighed 17 to 22 pounds which could have kept them small enough to fit in rucksacks, Commissioner Blair said.
He promised Londoners that his department would not tire in its search for the killers: "We will bend every sinew of the Metropolitan Police and all our associated agencies and comrades to do that."
Even Queen Elizabeth II, who rarely makes public statements and even more rarely says anything mildly provocative, addressed workers at the Royal London Hospital in East London in a speech that was televised nationwide.
She first spoke admiringly of how Londoners handled themselves during the attacks and immediately after, remaining remarkably calm during a morning that could have devolved into chaos but remained far from it.
And she was impressed by their resolve, she said, for being "calmly determined to resume their normal lives."
Then, in a stern tone, she reminded the country in a message that might have been directed at the attackers, that Britain survived the German bombing campaigns of World War II with its character intact and that it would prevail again, and always.
"Atrocities such as these simply reinforce our sense of community, our humanity, our trust in the rule of law," the queen said.
"That is the clear message from us all."
Scotland Yard said its investigation has determined that the three subway blasts came from bombs left on the floor, not seats.
No evidence exists that suicide bombers were involved in the attacks on the trains, according to Blair, the commissioner, but he was less certain about how the bomb on the bus was detonated.
Police investigator Andy Hayman said forensic investigators had not determined the location of the explosive device on the bus, which blew apart near Tavistock Square in the heart of the city.
Recovery workers were prevented from getting to a subway train on which 22 people died between the King's Cross and Russell Square stations on the Piccadilly Line.
While all the blast survivors have been removed by rescuers, investigators could not reach the train until midafternoon Friday because the tunnel walls were damaged and are considered unstable.
The commissioner linked the tactics of the bombers to the "hallmarks of al Qaida," but he said he had no evidence to support the connection.
Subway stations where the attacks hit remained closed, cordoned off as crime zones, and several security alerts briefly shut down stations throughout the day.
Prime Minister Tony Blair said at a news conference at the close of the Group of Eight summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, that "these people who have inflicted the politics of terror on people have no support in any democratic way," adding, "That is why they engage in terrorism."
The prime minister scoffed at a reporter's suggestion that the authorities might have in some way failed by not preventing the attacks.
"Those people who killed the innocent and caused such bloodshed," he said, "they're solely responsible."
(Optional add end) London's mayor, Ken Livingstone, said the city's emergency services had once run an exercise to prepare for the possibility of multiple explosions during rush hour on the public transport system.
Thanks in part to that exercise, he said, during the real disaster "we cannot think of a single thing that failed to work."
"I say to those who planned this dreadful attack, whether they are here in hiding, or somewhere abroad: Watch next week as we bury our dead and mourn them," Livingstone said.
"But see also, in those same days, new people coming to this city, to make it their home to call themselves Londoners and doing it because of that freedom to be themselves."
Bomb explosions tore through three subway trains and a red double decker bus in a coordinated terror attack during London's morning rush hour on Thursday, killing at least 37 people, injuring about 700 and leaving the city stunned, bloodied but oddly stoic.
On Wednesday, London bubbled over with joy at winning the 2012 Olympics.
On Thursday, commuters on the city's subways were plunged into the nightmare of a subterranean bloodbath, when an explosion tore through a subway train 100 yards into the tunnel at Liverpool Street Station at 8:51 a.m., according to a police chronology.
Seven people died.
The next explosion occurred at 8:56 a.m. near King's Cross Station, where the death toll was 21, the police said.
Twenty one minutes later, at 9:17 a.m., a third blast ripped through a train coming in Edgware Road underground station, killing seven.
Above ground, at 9:47 a.m., an explosion tore open the roof of a No. 30 double decker bus with such force that it threw debris three yards into the air.
The blast, at the junction of Upper Woburn Place and Tavistock Place, was so powerful that it took hours to determine that two people had died.
The entire subway network was closed as rescue workers went deep below ground to look for the dead and wounded.
Police in yellow slickers sealed off streets and bus services were halted.
"It is reasonably clear that there have been a series of terrorist attacks in London," a shaken looking Prime Minister Tony Blair told reporters before he left the Group of Eight summit meeting he was hosting at Gleneagles, Scotland.
The attack, he said, was timed to coincide with the summit meeting.
He flew back to London lead emergency ministerial meetings here, leaving the other seven leaders including President Bush for several hours.
A group called Secret al Qaida Jihad Organization in Europe claimed responsibility, saying the attacks were undertaken to avenge British involvement in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The attacks were the worst in British memory since World War II.
Some of the wounded were ferried to hospitals swathed in silvery space blankets, their faces blackened with soot.
The police said seriously injured people had lost limbs and were badly burned.
Yusuf Pandor, 40, of North West London was looking to return to his car on the other side of the barriers.
Just more than an hour earlier, he was one of many Samaritans helping pull bombing victims into the nearby Hilton Metropol.
"They were shaken, bleeding," Pador said.
"One woman was badly injured burned on her face.
She had it covered.
People were just shocked."
Loyita Worley, who works for a London law firm, told the BBC that she was in the subway when an explosion took place in the next carriage, while it was in a tunnel.
Worley, 49, said: "All the lights went out and the train came to an immediate halt.
There was smoke everywhere and everyone was coughing and choking, but remained calm.
We couldn't open the doors."
By evening some parts of the city were eerily calm, the usually thronged streets around some railroad stations cordoned off and empty while thousands of people packed the sidewalks, stranded by the lack of public transportation, seeking ways home.
Police working in a hot, dusty tunnel faced a "great challenge" recovering bodies from a bomb hit train near central London's Russell Square subway station, police said Saturday.
"It is extremely hot and very dusty and it is a great challenge for them to continue their work to recover the remaining bodies from the train underground," British Transport Police Deputy Chief Constable Andy Trotter told a news conference.
"This work will be slow, methodical and meticulous, and at the same time the forensic recovery teams are working alongside them in order to ensure that no clues are lost."
Demonstrators in the southwest of the Caucasus republic of Georgia staged protests Friday against the building of an oil pipeline through their district, a local television station reported.
Inhabitants of Akhaltsikhe blocked a dozen trucks carrying pipes belonging the oil company British Petroleum (BP).
BP heads plans to build a pipeline from Baku in Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea through the Georgian capital Tbilisi to Ceyhan in Turkey on the Mediterranean.
The townspeople complain that convoys of trucks carrying material for the project have wrecked roads in the area and are demanding compensation, the Imedi television station said.
Villagers in nearby Tkemlana also demonstrated against the building of the pipeline, local officials told AFP.
They pointed out that their homes are in an area with a high earthquake risk and call for the pipeline to be banned.
They also claim that 80 percent of their houses have been half destroyed by the continual passage of the heavy trucks.
They are further demanding a promised payment of 110000 lari (57291 dollars, 46187 euros) for the land needed for the pipeline.
BP has not so far reacted to the demands.
In August five Georgian police officers were injured during a protest by environmentalists opposed to the construction of the pipeline, which is due to come into service next year.
The pipeline is to carry a million barrels of oil a day from the Caspian to Turkey.
Talks between the state controlled Russian gas group Gazprom and Gaz de France (GDF) on a project to build a Baltic Sea pipeline are making headway, GDF chairman Jean Francois Cirelli said Wednesday.
"It's moving forward," he said after a meeting between Gazprom head Alexei Miller and French Prime Minister Jean Pierre Raffarin.
"Decisions have not yet been taken in Russia but I think we took an important step this morning.
"Russia has an interest in choosing good strategic partners who are capable of bringing gas to Europe and I think Gaz de France is well placed."
Cirelli said the scale of GDF's possible participation in the project, expected to cost several billion dollars, had not been determined.
The German group BASF, the world's largest chemical company, has also expressed interest in a project that would enable Russia to supply gas to Europe directly, bypassing Ukraine and Belarus.
"We discussed (with Miller and Raffarin) the cooperation we currently have with Gazprom, which should increase, and new areas of cooperation, notably in gas transportation and in the liquified natural gas sector," Cirelli said.
Russia's state controlled gas monopoly, Gazprom, plans to complete a new US$6 billion (euro4.6 billion) natural gas pipeline to Western Europe in 2010, a delay of three years from initial estimates, the Interfax news agency reported Tuesday.
"The pipeline will be launched in 2010," Interfax quoted Gazprom chief Alexei Miller as telling German television after a meeting with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
When Gazprom first unveiled the North European Gas Pipeline project in December 2002, Miller said the gas would start flowing first to continental Europe and onward to Britain in 2007.
On Tuesday, Miller said the pipeline would make it possible to increase Russian gas supplies to Germany and other European Union countries, Interfax reported.
Gazprom, the world's largest gas producer and a key supplier to Europe, has begun design work on the onshore section.
Much of pipeline will cross under the Baltic Sea and make landfall in northern Germany before continuing through the Netherlands and across the English Channel.
Gazprom plans to tap the Yuzhno Russkoye field in northern Siberia, to fill the pipeline, which is to eventually export 20 billion 30 billion cubic meters (700 billion to 1 trillion cubic feet) of gas a year.
Seismic work and construction is currently being carried out at the field.
Russian gas giant Gazprom has reached a deal with Kazakhstan's government giving it a monopoly on gas exports from two of Central Asia's largest producers, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, Russian daily Kommersant reported on Monday.
State controlled Gazprom and a subsidiary of Kazakhstan's national oil and gas group, Kazmunaigaz, signed a series of agreements last week on Russian and Central Asian natural gas transports transiting Kazakhstan during 2006 2010, Gazprom said in a statement but provided no further details.
But according to Kommersant, which quoted a source close to the negotiations, the two parties agreed to set up "an export canal solely for the Kazakh Russian company Kazrosgaz".
That would mean that "not a cubic meter of (Turkmen or Uzbek) would be sold beyond Kazakhstan without Gazprom's participation," the paper wrote.
The agreement does not cover Kazakh gas exports of between six and seven billion cubic meters, a Kazmounaigaz spokesman told AFP.
Kazakhstan, a key transit country for Central Asian gas exported to Europe, can transport 50 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year.
The deal is expected to disappoint Ukraine, which had hoped to build a gas pipeline between Turkmenistan and Ukraine via Kazakhstan in a bid to decrease its energy dependancy on Russia.
The Russian state owns just over 50 percent of Gazprom.
The company's key role in supplying and transiting energy to former Soviet states is often seen as a way for the Kremlin to exercise political pressure on its neighbours.
Greece and Italy will sign an agreement on Nov 4 in Rome for the construction of an underwater natural gas pipeline between the two countries, the Greek Development Ministry said Monday.
The underwater pipeline will be built by Depa, Greece's natural gas supplier, and Italy's Edison SpA On June 24, Greek Development Minister Dimitris Sioufas and his Italian counterpart, Claudio Scagiola, signed a memorandum of understanding to connect their respective countries' natural gas networks.
The pipeline will eventually be linked via another pipeline across northern Greece to a third that is being built between Greece and Turkey.
Together, the three pipelines will enable Caspian and Central Asian natural gas to be transported to Europe.
All three pipelines are part of the Southern Europe Gas Ring Project.
Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder faced criticism Friday over plans to take on a leading position at a consortium building a gas pipeline between Russia and Germany.
As chancellor, Schroeder enjoyed a close personal and professional relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
But now critics question the ethics of him standing to gain personally from a major financial deal that he supported in his role as chancellor.
"It stinks," said Reinhard Buetikofer, co chairman of Germany's Greens, which had been the junior party in a coalition with Schroeder's Social Democrats until September.
The Social Democrats continue to govern along with the conservative Christian Democrats in a so called grand coalition, while the Greens are in the opposition.
Schroeder is to become chairman of Gazprom's shareholder committee, a post roughly comparable to board chairman, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller's spokesman Sergei Kuprianov said in Russia on Friday.
Rainer Bruederle, a leading member of Germany's pro business FDP party, said he hopes Schroeder will only hold an honorary post, otherwise the suspicion would arise that the former chancellor cannot distinguish between public and private affairs.
Earlier in the day, officials sealed the first link in the natural gas pipeline, which will run along the Baltic seabed and bring the resources of Russia's gas fields to the German market.
Russian gas giant OAO Gazprom, which will lead the consortium building the pipeline, is the world's largest gas producer and supplies a quarter of Europe's natural gas.
The first section of the pipeline is scheduled to begin operation in 2010.
Construction of the Turkey Greece natural gas pipeline is scheduled to start at the beginning of July, Greek Development Minister Dimitris Sioufas said Friday.
The 300 kilometer (186 mile) pipeline will run from Bursa in Turkey to Komotini in Greece and is designed to transport Caspian and Central Asian natural gas to Europe.
Initially, the pipeline will transport 3.5 billion cubic meters of gas a year, but this will rise to 11.5 billion cubic meters a year at a later stage, Sioufas said.
The increase in capacity will take place once the pipeline is connected to two other planned gas pipelines.
The first of these will run for 600 kilometers (373 miles) across northern Greece from Komotini to the northwest Greek port of Stavrolimena, where it will connect with a 220 kilometer (137 mile) long pipeline that will run under the Ionian Sea to Italy.
The underwater section will be built by Greece's natural gas supplier Depa and Italy's second biggest power group Edison, and is expected to be completed by 2010.
The joint venture is open to other investors.
Turkish gas company Botas could join the project, Edison said.
Construction of these two pipelines will be mainly funded by the European Union as well as the Greek and Italian governments.
Also Friday, Sioufas and Italian Industry Minister Claudio Scajola signed the protocol for the connection of the Greek and Italian natural gas networks.
The pipelines are all part of the Southern Europe Gas Ring project, due to be completed by end 2006.
Welders crouching on a snowy field sealed the first link Friday in a natural gas pipeline that will stretch along the Baltic seabed, linking the resources of Russia's gas fields with energy hungry German consumers.
Politicians and dignitaries looked on in minus 15 C (5 F) temperatures as construction began in the Vologda region, 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of Moscow.
Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov hailed the "major project of cooperation between Russia and Europe."
"We are creating the conditions for stable cooperation in the energy sector, ensuring energy security in Europe and the world," he was quoted as saying by the Interfax agency.
Russian gas giant OAO Gazprom, which will lead the consortium building the pipeline, is the world's largest gas producer and supplies a quarter of Europe's natural gas.
The first section of the pipeline is scheduled to begin operation in 2010, ultimately pumping 55 billion cubic meters (72 billion cubic yards) of gas per year from Vyborg, in northwest Russia, to Greifswald, in northern Germany.
The pipeline is a "very important landmark in the development of the entire economy of the European Union," Germany's Economics Minister Michael Glos was quoted by Interfax as saying at the ceremony.
"This is a direct route that will link Russia and Germany, as well as consumers in other countries in the future.
It is ,of principal significance," Alexander Medvedev, deputy head of Gazprom's management board, said in televised comments.
The 1200 kilometer (745 mile) pipeline bypasses existing transit routes through Poland, Belarus and Ukraine, which Gazprom said in a statement was intended to "exclude possible political risks."
The project also has raised fears over its environmental impact.
State controlled Gazprom has partnered with German companies E.On AG and BASF AG to build the section of the pipeline that passes under the Baltic Sea and has said it will look for a third partner.
Under President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin has moved in the past year to regain control over Russia's oil and gas sectors crucial geopolitical tools at a time of tight supplies and high world prices.
Soaring oil prices have sent money flooding into the nation's coffers and fueled an economic boom.
Natural gas futures, too, hit a new intraday high in trading Friday, reaching US$15.52 per 1000 cubic feet during the Asian trading session.
Chris Weafer, chief strategist with Alfa Bank in Moscow, said the groundbreaking ceremony was "symbolic."
"It reinforces how important Gazprom is for Russia's economic and political interaction with the western world," he said.
Gazprom will control 51 percent of the consortium company, called the North European Gas Pipeline Co. Chairman of the company's shareholder committee roughly comparable to board chairman will be former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller's spokesman Sergei Kuprianov said.
Mathias Warnig, the former head of Dresdner Bank AG's Moscow office and a longtime friend of President Vladimir Putin, has been appointed its CEO.
Warnig and the Russian president met during Putin's posting with the KGB in Communist East Germany.
Austria's OMV Gas and Bulgaria's Bulgargaz EAD said Thursday they signed a cooperation agreement aimed at strengthening ties and trade between the two petroleum concerns.
OMV Gas, a wholly owned subsidiary of Austrian petroleum giant OMV, said it and Bulgargaz agreed to a greater exchange of information and technology as they explore possible joint ventures in Central and Eastern Europe.
The two companies have been working together on the Nabucco project a plan for a natural gas pipeline that would run from Turkey through Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary to Austria.
OMV Gas supplies natural gas to Austria as well as to neighboring Germany, Italy, Hungary and Slovenia and to France and Croatia.
Bulgargaz provides natural gas to Bulgaria as well as Greece, Macedonia and Turkey.
Plans by Russia and Germany to build a north European gas pipeline flout the idea of Europe adopting a common policy towards Moscow, President Aleksander Kwasniewski of new EU member Poland said on Wednesday.
"From the point of view of a common European policy towards Russia, it is unfortunate that one of the EU member states, an important country, Germany, should make its own policy decisions, going over the heads of Poland and the EU," Kwasniewski said on Radio Zet, a commercial station.
"This Russian German project tends away from the concept of a common European policy," he added.
Berlin and Moscow are expected to sign an agreement on the pipeline on Thursday when Russian President Vladimir Putin visits Germany.
The idea for a north European gas pipeline originated with Gazprom of Russia.
The signature concerns about 1200 kilometres (750 miles) of pipeline under the Baltic Sea from Vyborg in Russia to Greifswald in Germany, as part of a total network which is to extend for 3000 kilometres.
The pipeline is intended as an alternative means of transporting natural gas than by passing through Ukraine.
Gazprom will build the pipeline with the German BASF company, and expects it to be operational in 2010.
Poland and the Baltic states are critical of the pipeline project, saying they fear it could see them cut off from supplies of Russian gas.
Former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was voted in Thursday as head of the supervisory board of a consortium that plans to build a natural gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, a company statement said.
The vote confirming Schroeder as the supervisory board's chairman was taken at the board's first meeting at Gazprom's headquarters in Moscow.
"This pipeline is not aimed against anyone but is aimed at ensuring the security of gas supplies to Europe," Schroeder said.
Other members of the supervisory board include Gazprom chief executive Alexei Miller as well as officials from Germany's E.ON and BASF.
Gazprom has a 51.0 percent stake in the North European Gas Pipeline, while BASF and E.ON hold 24.5 percent each.
Gazprom said Thursday that Gaz de France could also become a partner in the project.
Schroeder's acceptance of the post less than a month after he left the chancellor's office last November prompted widespread criticism in Germany.
He and Russian President Vladimir Putin had worked closely on cementing German investment in the pipeline.
Earlier this week he paid a visit to Gazprom production facilities in the Siberian province of Yamalo Nenets.
The pipeline plan has prompted criticism from new EU members Lithuania and Poland, which complained that Schroeder had gone over their heads on a pipeline that is likely to pass through other Baltic countries' territorial waters.
Work on the pipeline has already begun onshore in Russia.
Under the Russian plan the pipeline will eventually connect not only to Germany but to other parts of western Europe, including the Netherlands, Sweden and Britain.
Faced with mounting criticism from its natural gas customers across Western Europe, Russia on Monday restored most of the gas it withheld from Ukraine's pipeline system a day earlier in a pricing dispute.
Officials of the state owned Russian company, Gazprom, presented the decision not as a reversal but as a response to Ukraine's "theft" of natural gas.
But it became clear that the driving force in Russia's decision was the sharp criticism across Europe, including countries that are usually reliable allies.
Within hours after Russia disrupted gas supplies on Sunday morning by reducing pressure in the pipeline system, a cascading energy emergency moved westward across Europe, as one utility after another reported dropping gas pressures at a time of peak demand in freezing weather.
As pressure continued to drop Monday, criticism erupted among European leaders, jittery over the threat to one of the Continent's primary sources of energy.
The minister of economy in Germany, the largest consumer of Russian natural gas in Europe, questioned Russia's reliability as an energy supplier.
Ukrainian officials, who had been gearing up for a national conservation effort, greeted the decision to restore pressure to the pipelines that came in a telegram from Russia at around 3 p.m. Monday.
"We think common sense won," Irina Gerashchenko, the spokeswoman for Ukraine's president, Viktor A. Yushchenko, said in a telephone interview.
Sunday's decision to choke off the westbound natural gas pipelines was seen as a gamble by Moscow to influence Ukraine's internal politics ahead of a parliamentary election in March, even though Gazprom contended that it was motivated by business interests.
Ukraine's energy troubles are far from over.
Russia took other steps on Monday that will limit Ukraine's other sources of natural gas, and it was still unclear what Ukraine would eventually pay for its gas.
Both sides said negotiations would continue.
Ukraine's fuel and energy minister, Ivan Plachkov, denied that the country was siphoning gas for itself, a delicate issue for Ukraine, which is a signer of the European Energy Charter, a treaty that seeks to secure the flow of fuel across borders.
"There has been no unauthorized diversion of natural gas," he said.
Russia's top energy official suggested here Wednesday that a US backed pipeline project that would bypass Russia by linking Central Asia's gas fields directly with the West was premature.
Russian Industry and Energy Minister Viktor Khristenko said the undetermined borders of the Caspian Sea area would be a stumbling bloc for the project, which would cut Russia out of deals to transport Central Asian gas across its territory.
"Resolving the issue of a trans Caspian system, including the construction of a pipeline, will be possible only after agreeing to a clear understanding of the status of the Caspian," Khristenko told reporters.
The proposed pipeline would link the vast gas reserves of Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan to a yet unfinished pipeline that will soon connect Azerbaijan's own gas deposits with Europe through Georgia and Turkey.
Top US officials dealing with the region have taken a different view of the project.
The Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs, Matt Bryza, told AFP that it was up to the countries involved to decide whether the project should go ahead "Several feasibility studies have demonstrated the technical, environmental and economic feasibility of a trans Caspian pipeline and it is up to the countries through which the pipeline would travel and the investors concerned to decide whether to proceed," Bryza said during a telephone interview.
Bryza added that Saparmurat Niyazov, the president of Turkmenistan, "showed interest in exploring the possibilities of the trans Caspian pipeline, as well as other options," during a January meeting in Ashgabat.
Azerbaijan currently exports much of its oil through Russia's territory, but an alternative route through a new pipeline linking Baku with the Turkish port of Ceyhan is to open later this year.
"We understand these processes, we are trying to localize the risks," Khristenko said, adding that Russia transported 4.1 million tonnes of Azerbaijani crude through its Novorossiysk pipeline last year.
Croatia and Hungary are weighing construction of a gas pipeline from the Adriatic Sea to mainland Europe in order to decrease reliance on Russian gas, the prime ministers of the two central European countries said Thursday.
The project, which seeks to address recent disruptions in Russian gas supplies to Europe, calls for building a liquiefied petroleum gas (LPG) terminal at an Adriatic port and transporting the gas to central Europe.
"We would like to build a terminal for liquiefied petroleum gas on the (Adriatic) coast, from which we can have pipelines reaching into Europe," Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany said at a press conference.
Croatian counterpart Ivo Sanader, appearing alongside Gyurcsany, added: "This is not only in the interest of Croatia, it is also for Hungary and we could extend this to other central and eastern European countries."
He mentioned Austria and Slovakia in particular.
Earlier this month, a price dispute between Russia and Ukraine, a major transit country for gas, affected supplies to Europe and pushed EU leaders to start thinking about alternative sources for gas.
The European Union imports more than 40 percent of its natural gas, and around half of that comes from Russia.
Some parts of central and eastern Europe depend almost entirely on Russia for their gas supply.
"We think along the lines of Hungary, we really want to do everything in order to be independent in terms of energy," Sanader said.
He said the Croatian government would next week hold the first committee level meeting on the project.
The pipeline would allow for a diversification of gas supply sources into Europe, notably by using liquid gas from North Africa and the Middle East, according to officials.
Hungarian Economy Minister Janos Koka earlier this month said a feasibility study for the pipeline could be completed by the end of March.
Russia and Azerbaijan clashed on Wednesday over plans to lay a major gas pipeline under the Caspian Sea, during a meeting of the five countries surrounding the sea.
"A major gas pipeline would pose a serious, dangerous risk to the prosperity of the entire region," senior Russian diplomat Alexander Golovine told Ria Novosti news agency at the end of the meeting.
This is not the first time Russia has opposed the project for the US backed pipeline, which would bypass Russia by linking Central Asia's gas fields directly to the West and therefore cut Moscow out of gas transit deals between Central Asia and the West.
"The issue should be solved between all the countries around the Caspian, independently of the route chosen," Golovine said.
"The Caspian is a unique water source which must be treated carefully, including when it comes to pipeline installations."
Golovine was talking just days after Russia's Supreme Court backed plans for a major oil pipeline through an earthquake prone region of Siberia that risks seriously polluting Lake Baikal, the world's biggest source of fresh water.
Azerbaijan retorted by saying the construction of a gas pipeline across the bed of the Caspian should not pose a problem.
"The Russian side has submitted arguments but Azeri experts have provided demonstrations," Ria Novosti quoted Baku's deputy foreign minister, Khalaf Khalafov, as saying.
The proposed pipeline would link the vast gas reserves of Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan to an as yet unfinished pipeline taking Azerbaijan's gas deposits to western Europe through Georgia and Turkey.
Azerbaijan currently exports much of its oil through Russian territory but an alternative pipeline linking Baku with the Turkish port of Ceyhan through the Georgian capital, Tbilissi, is due to come on stream later this year.
Laying a gas pipeline along that same route would enable Azerbaijan to transport gas from its promising Shah Deniz fields to eastern Turkey from 2007, while circumventing Russian territory.
Russian natural gas monopoly Gazprom sees partnerships with Western energy producers as key to its future, the deputy CEO said Thursday, citing cooperation with German companies as successes while dismissing reports it was looking to buy Scottish Power.
Alexander Medvedev told an energy forum in Berlin that he hoped increased partnerships would gain OAO Gazprom better access to new markets.
"Gazprom intends to remain the leading gas supplier to Europe and expand sales to industrial and commercial end customers in the European markets.
Another direction of Gazprom's strategy is expansion to new markets including the United Kingdom, the United States and countries of the Asia Pacific region," Medvedev said.
"Partnerships can help Gazprom obtain direct access to new target markets."
Gazprom's pledge came at an awkward time, however, as new concerns were raised about the company's ability to ensure steady fuel supplies.
Countries including Italy, Croatia and Hungary reported decreased supplies of Russian gas this week as bitterly cold weather in Russia increased demand at home.
Russia's image already was damaged when a dispute with Ukraine around New Year's decreased deliveries to Europe.
Medvedev stressed that Gazprom, which supplies a quarter of European Union gas consumption, was in "full compliance with our contracts."
He also cited cooperation with Germany's BASF AG and E.On Ruhrgas, a unit of E.On AG, on the planned construction of a new North European Gas Pipeline as an example of a partnership success.
He added Gazprom was still willing to take on another partner in the project up until April, if the company was the right fit.
"We don't need a formal partner, we need a partner that will bring something to the project which we don't have today," Medvedev said on the sidelines of the conference.
He said the partnership with E.On is broadening, and that the companies are in talks over cooperation in Hungary and on the Germany company's plan to take a stake in Gazprom's Yuschno Russkoje gas field.
The pipeline being built by Gazprom, E.On Ruhrgas and BASF's Wintershall unit will transport Siberian gas to northern Germany via international waters in the Baltic after completion in 2010.
There has been talk of extending the pipeline to other European countries, including Great Britain, and Medvedev said Gazprom was "monitoring what is going on in the British market."
Still, he dismissed speculation about Scottish Power.
"We didn't look at Scottish Power yet," he told reporters.
Italian oil and gas company Eni SpA said Thursday that it expects natural gas supplies from Russia to Italy to be 12.2 percent below requested volumes in the 24 hours ending Friday morning.
It said that gas supply from Russia in the previous 24 hours fell 6.8 percent below requested volumes.
Though Medvedev stressed that Gazprom was in compliance with its contracts, he conceded that there were times in cold weather when the company would not be able to supply as much gas as during warmer months.
"Definitely we will stay within the framework of our contract agreements and try to deliver as much gas as possible," he said.
Gazprom caused consternation earlier this month when its gas deliveries to Europe fell sharply because of the price dispute with Ukraine, whose pipeline network transits gas supplies to the rest of Europe a problem Medvedev said is now solved.
"The major achievement of our agreement with Ukraine is that from Jan 1 the question of transit and the question of supply in Ukraine are ,now two separate quarters, and that will never be changed," he said.
Ukraine conceded Tuesday that it had withdrawn natural gas from its pipeline system that Russia said was intended for export to Europe, but said it had a contractual right to the fuel under an agreement with the Central Asian nation of Turkmenistan.
Both Russia and Turkmenistan export natural gas through Russian pipelines to Ukraine, which customarily takes some for its own use and ships the rest on to other European countries.
But Russia cut the flow through the pipeline on Sunday, ostensibly in a dispute with Ukraine over pricing and transit fees.
That set off alarm bells throughout Europe during the winter heating season and shook world energy markets' confidence in Russia.
Russia placed blame for the shortages on Ukraine, saying it stole gas intended for export, but under pressure from European governments, Russia restored full flow to the pipeline on Monday.
Despite the bickering, the two countries resumed negotiations on gas prices on Tuesday.
Nevertheless, the price of crude oil leapt by more than $2 a barrel on Tuesday in afternoon trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, fed by concerns over Russia's reliability.
Crude oil prices rose to a two month, midday high of $63.80 a barrel before pulling back slightly.
While admitting that they took their usual allotment of gas on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials dismissed Russian claims that the gas was stolen.
Mikola Goncharuk, a member of the board of Ukraine's natural gas company, Naftogaz, said at a news conference in Kiev that his company had indeed drawn down gas from the pipeline system, but under a contract with Turkmenistan.
Russian export gas, he said, was untouched.
Gazprom, Russia's government owned gas company, insists that the pipeline carries only Russian gas for export to Europe.
Meanwhile, the political fallout continued from Russia's brief gas embargo, which was widely regarded in Europe as punishment of Ukraine for its rejection of Moscow in elections last year and its continued turn to the West and away from the Russian orbit.
In Washington, the State Department spokesman criticized Russia's use of energy as a foreign policy tool, while Austria and other Central and Eastern European countries agreed to make the diversification of energy supplies a priority, though they did not say how they would achieve it.
The European Union's top energy official said Tuesday that the pricing dispute could fester for weeks to come, jeopardizing one of the Continent's primary sources of energy.
The pipeline explosions that cut Georgia's and Armenia's gas supplies from Russia were an act of terror, the Russian prosecutor's office said Wednesday.
The investigation into last Sunday's blasts initially centred on what the prosecutor's office said was "premeditated destruction of property" but was now focused on "terrorism" and the illegal use of explosives, Itar Tass news agency reported.
Another investigation was looking into an explosion that targeted electricity cables crossing to Georgia.
Georgia's President Mikheil Saakashvili has accused Moscow of organising the attacks.
Russian authorities have so far announced no arrests or other progress in the investigation.
The incident took place at the height of an unusually harsh winter and also amid growing worries in Europe and along Russia's borders about over reliance on Gazprom, the Russian natural gas colossus which controls a third of the world's reserves.
On Wednesday, Russian engineers were still trying to repair the damage caused by the explosions to the pipeline to Georgia.
Russia moves natural gas shipments through a grid of Soviet era pipelines so complex it is virtually impossible to guarantee the gas it pumps into Ukraine comes out the other side and reaches European customers.
Several European countries reported shortfalls following the weekend cutoff of direct exports to Ukraine amid a price dispute.
Moscow accused Ukraine of siphoning off some of the transit shipments.
Kiev denied the claims.
The fuel crisis highlights the challenges Moscow faces in moving energy supplies across former Soviet territories it no longer controls.
Russia is the world's largest producer of natural gas, with many of its customers in Europe.
In total, Europe relies on Russia for about 25 percent of its gas.
Though Russia has built other delivery systems and plans more, about 80 percent of Russia's gas to Europe travels through Ukraine.
Two thirds of that rushes through a major pipeline that exits Ukraine at Uzhgorod, and then flows to a transit station at Velke Kapusany, Slovakia, said Sergei Kupriyanov, chief spokesman for the state run Russian gas monopoly Gazprom.
Kupriyanov said it was impossible for Gazprom to ensure that all the gas moving through Ukraine reaches its final destination.
Natural gas is highly pressurized as it moves through a major pipeline, and to stay that way it needs to be compressed periodically along the way.
Compressors are often gas powered, meaning they use some of the gas in the pipeline.
Kupriyanov said that compressing the 360 million cubic meters of gas it sent into Ukraine for European customers on the first day of the year would use up about 4 percent of the total far less than Gazprom claims Ukraine siphoned off.
He also said the company paid a fee for compression in advance.
Gazprom said Monday it was increasing the volume pumped into trans Ukrainian pipelines to compensate for the amount it claims Ukraine is stealing.
European countries reported their supplies were returning to normal.
Austrian energy giant OMV expects a decision to be reached on the construction of a gas pipeline between Iran and Europe by the end of 2007, the head of OMV Gas, Otto Musilek, said in a German radio interview broadcast on Tuesday.
"Current developments will help us speed up the project," Musilek told Deutsche Welle radio, referring to the recent gas dispute between Russia and the Ukraine.
"The decision regarding the construction of the pipeline will be made by the end of 2007 at the latest."
In a project dubbed "Nabucco", OMV plans to build a 3300 kilometre gas pipeline from Iran to Austria via Turkey and the Balkan states.
The cost of the project is 4.6 billion euros (5.5 billion dollars) and the pipeline is to deliver up to 30 billion cubic metres of gas each year.
"For digging to begin, we need a transport volume of at least eight billion cubic metres each year.
Negotiations with suppliers and distributors of natural gas are progressing well," Musilek said.
OMV did not regard the project as a rival to the planned German Russian pipeline, he continued.
"According to forecasts, gas demand in Europe is going to grow enormously.
Russia won't be able to meet all that demand on its own. "
Europe therefore needed access to Iran's gas reserves, which were the second biggest in the world.
"But we're also looking to Azerbaijan and other Arab countries," Musilek said.
For Martha Stewart, a felony conviction is not such a good thing.
It's a great thing.
This weekend marks the end of Stewart's five month prison sentence, a term she chose to get over with by eschewing the option of milking the appeals process.
Stewart went to jail with her head held high even as friends, advertisers and investors deserted her seemingly sinking name brand ship: She returns to the outside world neither bowed nor broken, but ready to reclaim her spot at the top of, well, almost everything.
In April's issue of Martha Stewart Living, Stewart's column will resume, magazine readers were prepped for the return by editor Margaret Roach, who wrote in March about Martha's indomitable spirit during her incarceration.
Mark Burnett, impressed by Stewart's moxy, pitched two television shows: One is an "Apprentice" spinoff, the other, a resumption and update of her former daytime how to program, "Martha Stewart Living Television."
Shares in Stewart's company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. hit a 52 week high last week, though the company announced a record loss of $60 million in 2004, nearly 10 times the loss it suffered in 2003.
Stewart is reportedly in fighting shape, having lost 20 pounds in prison while impressing the locals with her down to earth attitude.
Fellow inmates at "Camp Cupcake" (West Virginia's Alderson Federal Prison Camp), have rallied to her side, shielding her from paparazzi while she's scoured the grounds for fresh salad greens and taught yoga.
There are still some challenges, of course, the largest of which is five more months of incarceration, albeit at her 153 acre estate in Bedford, N.Y.
Stewart's movements will be monitored by an ankle bracelet, she'll have regular appointments with a court officer, and while she's allowed 48 hours of work time each week outside the house, her movements must be accounted for.
The specter of a civil suit (separate and different from the criminal for which she went to prison) filed by the SEC hovers, though it's been reported that negotiations are under way for a settlement that would allow Stewart to reclaim her CEO status in five years.
(Stewart relinquished the title amid the controversy, and law prohibits her from regaining control of the company.)
She has a new boss in CEO Susan Lyne, who's used to working for high profile personalities (Rupert Murdoch, Michael Eisner) and has been a calm voice of reasoned support during the hoopla.
After her house arrest term expires, Stewart will be on probation for two more years.
Stewart won't be allowed to fraternize with other felons, meaning the friends she made in prison are off limits.
Nonetheless, Stewart is nothing if not resilient.

There will be no sweet potato spoon bread this year for Martha Stewart.
No cornbread sourdough stuffing, no cranberry pear chutney.
Not for her the recipes touted on her company's Web site as meals that will "make you wish your plate were bigger."
Instead, officials report that Stewart and her 1050 fellow inmates at West Virginia's Alderson Federal Prison Camp, where she is serving time for lying about a stock sale can expect a more traditional Thanksgiving meal.
The turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy, dressing and pumpkin pie will be prepared by inmates in the camp kitchen.
Nobody is saying whether the jail birds will be frozen, or fresh, as the nation's homemaker in chief might prefer.
Prison officials declined even to specify whether the turkeys will come from a local farm, like the 44 pound bird pardoned last week at the White House by President Bush.
The turkey was a native of Mathias, W.Va. A prison spokeswoman could promise only that they will be as cheap as possible.
"They utilize the most cost effective purchase options," said spokeswoman Dawn Zobel, who explained that prison officials regularly scan the Internet to find the least expensive foodstuffs.
Privacy rules prohibit Zobel from disclosing whether Stewart, 63, will be helping to prepare the feast, and her spokespeople aren't talking.
Thanksgiving Day comes on Day 48 of Stewart's five month stay at the sprawling minimum security campus on the Greenbrier River.
She chose to begin serving her time even as her appeal wends its way through the legal system.
The holiday is one of a sequence she will miss while on the inside, including Halloween, Christmas and New Year's.
In a Thanksgiving message posted yesterday on www.marthatalks.com not marthastewart.com, official Web site of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. she told fans that she is "safe, fit and healthy," though she acknowledged that "the loss of freedom and the lack of privacy are extremely difficult."
Stewart said her "daily interactions with the staff and fellow inmates here at Alderson are marked by fair treatment and mutual respect."
She added that she is "very grateful" this Thanksgiving for the support of her friends, family and colleagues, as well has that of her fans who, she wrote, have sent more than 15000 e mails.
Stewart has always said she loves the holidays, which helped create her media empire as millions of women tried out her seasonal recipes and decorating tips in hopes of capturing the country elegance of a Martha celebration.
Stewart stepped down as company chairman and chief executive after her indictment last year.
When she announced in September that she would enter prison soon, Stewart noted specifically how "very sad" she would be to miss the holidays this year.
"They are always an opportunity to celebrate family, friends and religious traditions that mean so much to many of us," she said then.
In an interview last month with CNN's Larry King, her daughter, Alexis Stewart, acknowledged that her mother loves the holidays and that spending them in prison would be very hard.
But she said a "whole bunch of her family" would travel to Alderson to celebrate Thanksgiving.
Although the prison generally allows only weekend visits, Stewart's family can take advantage of special hours Thursday, from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.
Inmates, who all are required to hold a prison job, get the day off, with the exception of those who work in the powerhouse and, of course, the kitchen.
The domestic diva's family shouldn't count on eating with Stewart, however.
In years past, Thanksgiving was the one day of the year when inmates' families were allowed past visiting rooms and into the heart of the camp where, for $1.75, they could share in the feast.
Not this year.
Zobel said the decision to limit the meal to inmates was a "procedural change" announced in August by the camp's new warden and was driven partly by budgetary concerns.
(Optional Add End) Instead, Stewart's relatives could attend some of the seasonal events that kick off this week in Alderson, a town of 1100 that has been home to the nation's oldest federal prison for women since it opened in 1927.
This weekend, several galleries and stores on Railroad Avenue will host their annual open houses.
Patti Grafton at the Wolf Creek Gallery will serve mulled cider.
In December, the town will host its annual Christmas celebration, throwing open the doors to decorated old mansions for tours.
The Singing Angels, a gospel choir made up of Alderson inmates, will perform at the Presbyterian church.
Among the things the town is thankful for this year is Stewart, whom they have adopted since she slipped through the gates of the prison down the road before dawn Oct 8.
Though the prison has hosted famous inmates before, none seem to have elicited quite as much interest as Stewart, who has brought with her a seemingly endless stream of reporters and tourists to shop in the stores and eat in the town's two restaurants.
Betty Alderson, who is married to a descendant of the town's founder and owns the 117 year old Alderson Store, just keeps selling her Martha themed T shirts.
The orders come in practically every day, from across the country more than 800 so far.
The sales, she said, will make this a nice Thanksgiving indeed for her family.
"We're in rural West Virginia.
We don't have a lot going on, and things are mighty slow," she said.
"We have a lot of bills to pay.
It's been good to have to that extra padding there to help us out."
Was the conviction of Martha Stewart for lying to federal investigators worth the effort?
For her, "the last five months in Alderson, West Virginia, has been life altering and life affirming," Stewart gushed in a statement on her Web site on Friday.
She added, "Someday, I hope to have the chance to talk more about all that has happened, the extraordinary people I have met here and all that I have learned."
Prison, it seems, was a good thing.
And that could present a problem for criminal law enforcement.
Punishing wrongdoing, the theory goes, has two primary goals: to penalize the wrongdoer and to deter potential wrongdoers.
But in Stewart's case, it is not clear that either goal was achieved.
"It achieved everything the government wanted it not to achieve," said Nina Marino, a defense lawyer in Beverly Hills, Calif. "From the government's perspective, the objective of incarceration is to punish someone, and I think that Martha Stewart has, ingeniously, instead of being punished turned it to her advantage."
Of course, Stewart is a most unusual ex con, few have her public relations savvy or resources.
"Stewart is very successful at spin," said Austin Sarat, a professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College.
"The prison episode right from the beginning has been successfully spun."
Then, too, the negative impact of Stewart's conviction was mitigated by the nature of the crime.
She was never criminally charged with insider trading, but rather with lying to investigators looking into a stock sale in December 2001.
To many, that just does not seem terribly heinous.
"We use prison too much and often for the wrong things," Sarat said.
"And like anything else we use too much, and for the wrong things, it loses its currency."
Some rap musicians have for years burnished their street credibility through weapons possession charges or worse.
But Stewart has used prison to soften her image to make her, in the public eye, a more sympathetic person than the perfectionist entertainer and executive she was seen to be before her sentence.
Conceivably, her success could subtly undermine the deterrent effect of a prison sentence, but that is neither here nor there, said David Becker, a former general counsel at the Securities and Exchange Commission who is now in private practice in Washington.
People go to prison and serve their time, once they have done so, they're through, Becker said.
"The criminal justice system is not about cleansing one's soul," he said.
So even if Stewart emerged from the Big House a hotter commodity than when she went in, justice could still have been served, Becker said.
If nothing else, he suggested, Stewart has probably learned not to lie to federal investigators.
"I have to believe that confronted with the same circumstances she would act differently," he said.
America's favorite domestic convict may have literally become a captive audience, but don't break out the glue stick and glitter for a greeting.
While Martha Stewart may receive letters from fans and well wishers while serving her sentence at Federal Prison Camp Alderson in West Virginia affectionately known as Camp Cupcake any crafts or other homemade concoctions are strictly forbidden.
No holiday centerpieces.
No cakes (especially ones with files baked inside).
Even homemade cards are iffy as glitter, ribbons, glue and stickers are no nos. Such cruelty.
Stewart herself addressed the restrictions in a letter posted on marthatalks.com.
"I have been told that some of these letters have included gifts and money.
Please know that while these gestures of friendship and support are deeply appreciated, any such items must be returned to the sender by prison officials.
Instead, if you are so inclined, please make a donation to the American Cancer Society, a charitable organization that means a lot to me," she wrote.
So how are her new digs?
"The camp is like an old fashioned college campus without the freedom, of course."
The better question: Who in their right mind is sending Martha Stewart money?
Still want to send her a letter?
Her address: Martha Stewart, No. 55170 054, FPC Alderson, Glen Ray Road, Box B, Alderson, WV 24910.

Martha Stewart, in a Christmas message posted on her personal Web site, called for sentencing reform and took a swipe at the "bad food" in prison.
Stewart, who is roughly halfway through a five month sentence for lying about a stock sale, urged fans to think about the women she has met in prison who are "devoid of care, devoid of love, devoid of family."
She suggested Americans should push for reforms in federal sentencing guidelines for nonviolent first time offenders and particularly for drug offenders, who she said would be better served by rehabilitation than prison.
Stewart, who built a billion dollar empire in homemaking, reported that her job at the federal prison camp in Alderson, West Virginia, has been cleaning, including sweeping, vacuuming and raking leaves.
"I have had time to think, time to write, time to exercise, time to not eat the bad food, and time to walk and contemplate the future," she said.
Earlier this month, her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, announced Stewart would host a daytime talk show with a live studio audience beginning this fall.
The company has been working with reality TV pioneer Mark Burnett, and shares of the media company have soared since Stewart reported to prison although they have fallen back somewhat in recent weeks.
Stewart is due to be released in early March from prison, then must spend five months confined to her home in Bedford.
The television show is scheduled to air after the five months of house arrest end.
Stewart and her former stockbroker, Peter Bacanovic, were convicted in March of lying about why Stewart unloaded shares of ImClone Systems Inc. stock in 2001, just before the price plunged.
Both are appealing.
Lawyers for Stewart filed new papers Wednesday with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, urging it to overturn her conviction.
The appeals court is expected to hear the case early in 2005.
The new papers, like Stewart's previous arguments, argue that prosecutors improperly implied she was accused of insider trading and that a government expert witness on ink analysis lied on the stand.

After undergoing chemotherapy in Tacoma, Washington, Kathy Herrmann flew across the United States to see Martha Stewart as she left a federal prison in West Virginia early Friday.
"I'm tired but it meant enough for me to come out here anyway," Herrmann said, who had her chemotherapy treatment on Wednesday.
"It's all about support."
Herrmann and several friends stood at the Greenbrier Valley airport in minus 9 Celsius (16 Farenheit) weather holding a Martha Stewart brand floral print sheet with signatures from Seattle area fans.
The cross country trip was not their first to support the homemaking queen.
Last year, Herrmann and others attended Stewart's trial in federal court in Manhattan.
That ended with Stewart begin convicted on charges of lying about a 2001 stock sale.
As part of her sentence, Stewart was ordered to serve five months at the federal women's camp in Alderson.
The prison term ended at 12:30 a.m. (0530GMT) Friday when she was released.
Stewart boarded a private jet for the flight to New York, where she must spend five months of home confinement at her 153 acre (62 hectare) estate.
"She's been a blessing to the prison and a blessing to the girls there," said Hattie Hopkins.
The former prison minister is used to high profile inmates at the minimum security prison, but "it wasn't as exciting as" Stewart's stay and departure.
Not everyone in the crowd was a fan.
Some came to experience the moment.
"I came down just because it's history.
I'm definitely not a fan," said Lisa Huff of Bluefield, Virginia.
Huff was talking to a friend earlier in the evening when she decided to make the 64 mile (100 kilometer) trip to Alderson.
"When she went in, I thought she was mean.
But when she decided to go to jail, now she looks more contrite," Huff said.
"I think jail has been great for her."
One of the tasks ahead of Stewart is to try and spin the goodwill she gained in prison into profits for her Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc.
Despite high stock prices, the company has posted a loss last year.
But William Parr, 66, of Amherst, Virginia, said Stewart will rebound because she has the "Midas touch."
"I love this lady.
I've followed her for the last 20 years," said Parr, who drove about 100 miles (160 kilometers) to see Stewart.
"She has definitely got her act together on the home front."
Martha Stewart, who is about to get out of prison, seems to have undergone a makeover on the cover of the latest Newsweek.
Stewart's face was placed on someone else's body for the cover story "Martha's Last Laugh," making the 63 year old look terrific after five months behind bars.
Newsweek editors said there was nothing wrong with the "photo illustration," given that it's well known Stewart hasn't done any fashion spreads from prison in West Virginia.
"Anybody who knows the story and is familiar with Martha's current situation would know this particular picture" was an illustration and not a photograph, said assistant managing editor Lynn Staley.
Newsweek said it did not intend to fool readers in any way and regretted if the photo illustration left any misimpression.
Since entering federal prison in October, Martha Stewart has tried her hand at ceramics, learned to crochet and become an expert on vending machine snacks.
She has also gotten a lot wealthier.
And when Stewart completes her sentence six weeks from now, colleagues at her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, anticipate an even bigger payoff.
When Stewart was convicted last March of lying to investigators, the future looked grim for the lifestyle company she created.
The company's shares hit a low of $10.86 that day, slipping even further the following week.
Her flagship television show, Martha Stewart Living, was placed on hiatus after losing many of its CBS viewers.
Scores of employees were laid off, and merchandise sales, mainly through Kmart, declined.
Revenue plunged to $127.2 million through last September compared with $175 million a year earlier, and the company is expected to post a loss for 2004.
What a difference a few months in prison can make.
Since Stewart's conviction, her company's share price has nearly tripled, increasing her personal stake to an estimated $827 million from $318 million.
Her March 6 release also creates a one of a kind marketing opportunity for her company, one that is not lost on Mark Burnett, the "Survivor" producer who is planning a daily live audience program featuring Stewart for NBC this fall.
"This country is all about second chances," Burnett said.
"That's what makes it the greatest country in the world."
While they would not disclose specific figures, executives at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia say licensing fees for the daytime show "are trending significantly higher" than those for Stewart's original show, even at its peak.
Doing time or what her friends call "the intermission" has breathed new life into the company's shares.
Some investors and analysts believe the shares are now over priced and could fall back to earth soon after the interest in Stewart's post prison status fades.
The stock closed Wednesday at $28.31, down 2.1 percent from the previous day, after the company announced plans to shutter its catalog and online divisions in February.
Still, the shares are way up from their lows of about $8.50 just before her sentencing last July.
Whether American consumers view her as a more sympathetic person, or are just curious what she'll be like after prison, doesn't seem to matter to marketing experts, some of whom think she will be able to take advantage of the renewed interest either way.
Her life inside the prison with its predawn wakeup calls, unappealing food and suffering fellow inmates has been sufficiently chronicled so that the 63 year old Stewart seems more a sympathetic character than a frosty prima donna concerned only about her own agenda.
"If she gets behind prison reform, then she becomes Saint Martha," said Hayes Roth, a brand consultant with Landor Associates in New York.
"It would be great for the brand and great for Martha.
If she gets back to running the basics of the business and has this added patina, if you will, of having suffered and moved ahead in her life well, Americans love that."
US lifestyle guru Martha Stewart is expected to leave jail on Friday after a five month sentence for a stock scandal that reinvigorated her career rather than dooming it.
Stewart's time in jail officially ends Sunday, but the federal prisons bureau can release prisoners on a Friday if their sentences end over the weekend, said US prisons spokeswoman Carla Wilson.
Supporters eagerly awaited her release from the Alderson minimum security prison in West Virginia, which inmates call "Camp Cupcake".
A large media group was also outside the prison.
Stewart's reputation has made a massive public rebound during her time in Alderson, despite the conviction for lying about a dodgy stock sale.
She will still have to serve five months under confinement at her country estate in Bedford, New York.
But Stewart has won a contract to host a spin off of tycoon Donald Trump's successful television reality show "The Apprentice."
She will also star in a show focusing on the same subjects that she built into a multi million dollar lifestyle empire cooking, entertaining, decorating and home renovating.
The businesswoman was convicted in March last year of lying to federal agents investigating her sale of nearly 4000 shares in biotechnology company ImClone Systems.
She began serving her sentence in October.
Newsweek noted her post conviction fame in its cover this week headlined: "Martha's Last Laugh: After Prison, She's Thinner, Wealthier and Ready for Prime Time."
But the newsweekly is also in trouble for using the head of Stewart on the body of a model for the cover picture.
Shares of the Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (MSO) empire, which she founded, were up 4.81 percent Thursday, trading at 33.58 dollars in afternoon trading.
According to Stewart's aides, the head of the empire is very optimistic about her future.
"This year, we usher in spring with an extra measure of gratitude, because the month of March not only marks the vernal equinox on the twentieth and the real start of our Northeast growing season, but also Martha's homecoming," Margaret Roach, editor in chief of Martha Stewart Living, wrote in the magazine's March edition.
Roach said Stewart will plant a garden in an old estate she has been renovating in Bedford.
"I can tell you she is, indeed, ready to get planting, having ordered her seeds and made extensive to do lists, just as she would have done in any winter," the editor wrote.
Roach also recounted some of Stewart's prison activities.
"The tales were always surprising," she said.
Stewart foraged for wild greens such as dandelion on prison property "to augment the limited fresh vegetable offerings in the diet there," helped decorate the chapel for a memorial service and made microwave meals "with whatever very basic ingredients the commissary had for sale."
She also launched a yoga class that she taught for 10 inmates, spent time crocheting and used old molds to create a nativity scene for her mother.
Roach even told how Stewart had carried out a yoga pose called "downward facing dog" in the visitors' room at the prison "from which she seamlessly moved into a headstand."
Martha Stewart, the billionaire entrepreneur who was convicted a year ago of lying to federal investigators, left prison early Friday in Alderson, W.Va., after serving a five month sentence.
Her time at the federal minimum security women's prison was behind her, but her appeal of that sentence has yet to be heard by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
She was released from prison about 12:30 a.m., according to a statement at the prison, the road crowded with journalists and fans.
From there, she was expected to travel to the Greenbrier Valley Airport, where she was to board a private plane.
Stewart, 63, must still serve five months in home detention at her estate in Bedford, N.Y., to complete her sentence for lying about the timing of a 2001 sale of shares in ImClone Systems.
Once the chairman and chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, she had to give up both titles after she was indicted in 2003.
Her company's stock, which represents the bulk of her fortune, crumbled amid the scandal, and she had to settle for the title of founder.
But the company's share price rose steadily during the five months Stewart was in prison, closing on Thursday at $33.95, up from a low of $8.25 in May.
Stewart will star in two television series and plans to resume writing her monthly column for Martha Stewart Living magazine and working at her office, one of the few places where she can go other than her 153 acre estate.
She must wear a monitoring bracelet and cannot work away from home for more than 48 hours a week.
She will be allowed, however, to be filmed at her estate.
As Martha Stewart arrives at the red brick federal prison in Alderson, W.Va., on Friday to begin a five month sentence, the company she founded is focused both on life without her and on life once she returns.
The company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, has already announced plans for a new television series that will start in January and will not include Stewart.
It has also purchased a magazine, Body & Soul, and a newsletter, Dr Andrew Weil's Self Healing, which share similar health related themes.
Neither publication includes Stewart's image or name, unlike the other products and publications the company distributes.
At the same time, Stewart is hardly relegated to the back burner.
The company announced last month that she will be featured in a prime time reality show produced by Mark Burnett, creator of "Survivor."
And she has signed a new contract that will pay her at least $900000 a year, once her prison term is complete, and gives her the titles of founder, chief editorial director and media director.
She is also entitled to a car and driver and a $100000 "nonaccountable expense allowance," the agreement states.
In a statement, the company called itself "grateful for the closure that Martha's decision to serve provides the company," adding that "We will miss her, and eagerly look forward to her return and to welcoming her back in March 2005."
In the meantime, the statement said, "Martha's standards of high quality and excellence will continue to guide everything we do."
Her role continues to be a complex one within the company, where employees look to her for guidance but saw their fortunes fade as her legal problems intensified in the last two years.
She was convicted in March of lying to government investigators about the reasons for her sale of nearly 4000 shares of ImClone Systems, a biotechnology company then run by her friend Samuel D. Waksal.
"This is the first step in rebuilding her image," said Allen Adamson, managing director at Landor Associates in Manhattan.
"She'll get more sympathy for being in West Virginia than she could get with all her high priced lawyers."
He added, "While the company can talk about planning for life without her, the best thing for the company is to get her back, get this done, and let her move beyond it."
Before and after the trial, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia suffered as television stations dropped her show, advertisers fled the bad publicity and circulation of the magazine fell.
The company's share price has recovered to some extent, closing at $16.59 on Thursday compared with about $19 a share in June 2002, but the company has warned of losses through the end of the year.
In the second quarter, the most recent results available, the company lost 39 cents a share.
Stewart, who was sentenced to five months of home confinement after her prison term, announced last month that she would begin serving her sentence without waiting for the outcome of an appeal she plans to file in the next few weeks.
"She's very stoic," her main appeal lawyer, Walter Dellinger, said.
"Losing all one's freedom and privacy for months is not an easy matter."
On Thursday, Dellinger sent a letter to the U.S. attorney and the judge overseeing the case, demanding documents from the trial of Larry F. Stewart, an ink specialist who testified for the government and who was subsequently accused of perjury.
Larry Stewart, who is not related to Martha Stewart, was acquitted of the charges on Tuesday.
The letter states that "Ms Stewart has not abandoned her appeal" and notes that while some materials had been turned over, "they did not include any of the pretrial materials requested."
Laboratory files that tested ink notations on a document listing Stewart's stock holdings are among the materials sought by Stewart's lawyers.
The notation "60" was central to the trial, because Stewart and her former stockbroker, Peter E. Bacanovic, both maintained that she sold her ImClone stock because they had earlier agreed to do so if the price fell below $60 a share.
Bacanovic, who was tried and convicted along with Stewart and sentenced to a virtually identical punishment, has not announced plans to begin serving his sentence.
An adviser to Bacanovic said he was considering doing so in order to get on with his life, but he is also planning to file an appeal and is free pending the outcome of that appeal.
Martha Stewart, trying to clear her tarnished name even as she serves a prison term, claims in her appeal that her trial was tainted by "a barrage" of unfair suggestions that she was charged with insider trading.
Lawyers for the celebrity homemaker argued in papers made public Thursday that government prosecutors, unchecked by the trial judge, confused jurors about the charges against Stewart.
"Martha Stewart was never charged with insider trading," the lawyers wrote, urging a federal appeals court to overturn her conviction.
"But a barrage of pretrial leaks and in court accusations left the indelible impression that she was guilty of that offense."
Stewart was charged only with deceiving investigators, not with insider trading.
But the appeals brief argues that prosecutors and the trial judge kept the jury from understanding the difference.
Prosecutors told jurors that Stewart had received a "secret tip" about her ImClone Systems Inc. stock just before she sold in December 2001, and said the case was about "cheating investors in the stock market."
The brief says prosecutors unfairly linked Stewart and ImClone founder Sam Waksal.
Waksal pleaded guilty to insider trading, admitting he sold ImClone because he knew about a forthcoming negative report about the company.
The papers were filed as new details emerged about Stewart's daily life at the minimum security federal women's prison in rural Alderson, West Virginia, her home until early March.
Walter Dellinger, the lawyer leading the appeal, said on NBC's "Today" that Stewart is exploring "innovative ways to do microwave cooking" with her fellow inmates.
He also said she spends up to three hours a night writing on a typewriter.
Dellinger said he did not know what she is writing, but Stewart has hinted she may write a book about her experience with federal law enforcement.
"She's making the best of what's necessarily a difficult situation," Dellinger said.
"I don't think she knew what to expect, but she's certainly been very pleased about it."
Since she reported to prison Oct 8, Stewart has posted at least one letter on her personal defense Web site saying that she is being treated well in prison.
She also says fans have sent her thousands of letters at Alderson, some including gifts and money.
Because gifts must be returned by prison officials, Stewart has asked fans to donate to the American Cancer Society instead.
Stewart and her former stockbroker, Peter Bacanovic, were each sentenced to five months in prison followed by five months of house arrest.
Stewart is due to be released from prison in early March, and it is unlikely the appeals court will hear the appeal much less decide it by then.
The appeal is more about clearing Stewart's name, and about lifting the cloud of scandal that has hung over her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., since the ImClone story broke in mid 2002.
Bacanovic and Stewart were both given the option of staying out of prison while they appealed.
Stewart elected to begin doing her time, while Bacanovic remains free.
The former Merrill Lynch & Co. stockbroker has also asked the appeals court to overturn his conviction.
He argued that the judge erred by not separating his case from Stewart's.
(c) 2004, Newsday= NEW YORK It's check in day for Martha Stewart.
Stewart, 63, who rose from working class roots in Nutley, N.J., to be named one of the United States' 50 Most Powerful Women by Fortune magazine in 1998, is expected to show up at the 105 acre, 1040 inmate Alderson Federal Prison Camp in West Virginia by 2 p.m. EDT Friday.
She will begin serving a 5 month sentence for lying to federal investigators about her suspiciously timed stock sale.
Stewart, founder of a multimillion dollar publishing and home decorating empire, spent Thursday with her mother, Martha Kostyra, 90, daughter, Alexis, and sisters.
"She's in very good spirits," said a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Stewart was an apparent no show Thursday night for the wedding reception for Susan Magrino, her long time friend and publicist, at the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan.
Guests said she didn't attend.
"Send her my love," writer Dominick Dunne said.
"I think the punishment exceeded the crime here, and I will be praying for her."
The source said Stewart has no fears about her safety at the Alderson camp, the first federal prison for women in the country and nicknamed Camp Cupcake because of its bakery.
"Alderson has a history of treating prisoners well," the source said.
"I think she is mentally prepared.
She's anxious to really begin the closure.
It was her decision to begin serving her term and hers alone."
Despite the prison's remote location nestled in the valley of the Keeney, Muddy and Wolf creeks and the Flattop Appalachian Mountains hordes of reporters and photographers have camped outside its stone and iron gates in hopes of recording Stewart's grand entry.
Her anticipated arrival has also attracted some tourists.
Karen and Bill Bright of Buckhannon, W. Va., with cameras in hand, said they detoured 11 miles to take in the show.
"We just wanted to see all the hoopla," said Bill Bright, 64.
Stewart will be issued four khaki work shirts, four khaki pants, two T shirts, seven pairs of underwear, one pair of work shoes, one nightshirt, six pairs of socks and a coat.
Concerned about Stewart's confinement, the Save Martha Web site has asked readers to send letters to Alderson's warden asking that Stewart be allowed to "share her talents with other inmates so that something good can come out of this unfortunate situation."
It also suggested that readers send care packages of craft items, snacks and board games "that could help her pass the time."
In the meantime, Stewart's appeal attorneys accused government prosecutors Thursday of withholding evidence that could have led to an acquittal.
In a letter to federal prosecutors, the lawyers alleged that documents and testimony of ink expert, Larry Stewart, showed the government lab had "sabotaged" testing of a key piece of evidence.
Robert Kahn contributed to this story.
US style guru Martha Stewart was friendly with inmates on her first night in jail and appeared in "good spirits" as she began serving a five month prison sentence in West Virginia, US media reported Sunday.
The New York Daily News said Stewart, wearing prison slacks, was spotted Saturday taking a midday stroll by herself on the grounds of the Alderson, West Virginia, federal prison.
She also saw two visitors, including her daughter Alexis.
Stewart reported to the jail on Friday to start a sentence for lying about a dodgy stock sale.
"When she came in, she was in good spirits," a prison staffer told the New York Daily News.
"She was received professionally.
She was treated just like anybody else, just like any inmate would be.
She's in good hands.
She'll be fine."
The Alderson prison, which has around 1050 inmates, sits in the Allegheny Mountains, some 270 miles (430 kilometers) southwest of Washington.
An inmate who met the businesswoman on her first night told her visiting aunt that Stewart was "very friendly and very cordial," according to the New York tabloid.
Another woman who visited an inmate said some prisoners are worried the 63 year old millionaire will get preferential treatment.
"She said, 'It's going to be a riot up there if they treat her better than they treat us,'" the visitor said, quoting the prisoner she was visiting.
Stewart, 63, was convicted in March of obstructing justice and making false statements to federal agents investigating her sale of nearly 4000 shares in the biotechnology company ImClone Systems.
Homemaking mogul Martha Stewart is using her prison time to figure out "innovative ways to do microwave cooking" to share with fellow inmates and is being treated with respect, her lawyer said Thursday.
"She's making the best of what's necessarily a difficult situation," lawyer Walter Dellinger said on NBC's "Today."
"There is no freedom.
It's regimented.
She has no privacy.
They are subject to strip searches.
But she's so resilient."
Stewart is in the first month of a five month sentence at the minimum security federal women's prison in Alderson, West Virginia.
She appealed her conviction late Wednesday.
Because inmates can only use a microwave to do their own cooking, Stewart is working with fellow prisoners to "come up with some creative recipes" based on the limited number of ingredients available at the prison commissary, Dellinger said.
"She has a group that is cooking," he said.
"She is trying to figure out innovative ways to do microwave cooking which is all they have."
"What she likes best about it, I think, is how much she likes the fellow inmates and the people who run the prison facility at Alderson, and the respect that they all seem to have for each other," Dellinger said.
Dellinger, who visited Stewart in prison Oct 13, also said she performed sanitation chores, such as cleaning toilets.
Stewart spends up to three hours a night writing on a prison typewriter with ribbons purchased at a prison store, he said.
The lawyer said he did not know what she is writing, but Stewart has suggested since her conviction that she might write a book about her recent experience with the legal system.
Martha Stewart has been exercising, reading and making friends in prison, but the food at the minimum security prison camp in West Virginia is "terrible," the domestic diva's daughter said Friday.
"I'm sure she could give them quite a few pointers, but I think that the budget is so limited that ,I'm not sure how much change they'd be willing to make," Alexis Stewart said on CNN's Larry King Live.
Stewart said she had played Scrabble with her mother during her visits to the federal women's prison in Alderson, West Virginia.
"She was having a lot of fun playing Scrabble until I started beating her," she said.
"Now she decided she doesn't want to play."
Alexis Stewart said her mother has one roommate in a dormitory type building that houses 80 women.
The celebrity homemaker has not yet been assigned a job, but in the meantime she has been taking walks, going to the gym, watching television news and reading.
The prison allows her mother to have five books at a time, and she subscribes to newspapers, Alexis Stewart said.
Alexis Stewart described reports that she was being groomed to take over her mother's company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, as "a large exaggeration" but the idea that she might someday run the company was within the realm of possibility.
Martha Stewart, 63, who was convicted of lying to investigators about a stock sale, is serving a five month sentence and is expected to be released in March.
(c) 2004, Newsday= NEW YORK Martha Stewart says she has been deluged by "thousands" of letters from fans sent to her federal prison camp in Alderson, W.V., some of which have even included gifts and money.
But, she lamented, the gifts are not allowed to reach her.
In a posting on her Web site, marthatalks.com, Stewart instead urged fans to make a donation to the American Cancer Society instead.
"I continue to be touched by the outpouring of support I have received from so many of you," she wrote.
"I am also touched that supporters have sent ,thousands of letters to me.
I have been told that some of these letters have included gifts and money.
Please know that while these gestures of friendship and support are deeply appreciated, any such items must be returned to the sender by prison officials."
"Instead, if you are so inclined, please make a donation to the American Cancer Society, a charitable organization that means a lot to me," she wrote.
Stewart will complete the second week of a five month prison term Friday for lying to the federal government about a stock transaction.
Dawn Zobel, a public information officer at Alderson, said she could neither confirm nor deny that Stewart has been the recipient of such a tsunami of mail.
However Zobel said inmate mail is subject to inspection for contraband or other banned items before it leaves the prison's postal facility.
If the package or letter is deemed inappropriate it will be returned.
Ana Marengo, a spokesman for the American Cancer Society in New York, said Stewart and her company Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, have long had a team that participates in an annual walk in Central Park "Making Strides" to raise money for breast cancer research.
Stewart participated with her team in last year's walk, Marengo said.
During this year's walk, held last Sunday, Stewart's MSO team raised $31000.
She said the American Cancer Society would keep a link on its Web site, www.cancer.org/makingstrides, that allows Martha fans to donate money via Stewart's team for about the next month.
A spokeswoman for Stewart did not return calls for comment.
American style guru Martha Stewart reported to a prison known as "Camp Cupcake" on Friday to start a five month sentence for lying about a dodgy stock sale.
The multimillionaire founder of the Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia lifestyle empire entered the minimum security federal prison camp in Alderson, West Virginia at 6:15 am (1015 GMT), the Justice Department said in a statement.
Stewart, 63, was convicted in March of obstructing justice and making false statements to federal agents investigating her sale of nearly 4000 shares in the biotechnology company ImClone Systems.
"While I am away, my updates here will be less frequent, if not altogether impossible," Stewart said in a message to supporters posted on her website.
"But please know this change is only an unfortunate reflection of my current circumstances, and in no way diminishes my commitment to my life's work or to the friends, colleagues, customers and supporters who make it possible," she said.
When Stewart was sentenced in July, the judge allowed her to remain free pending an appeal.
Last month, however, Stewart asked to begin serving her time as soon as possible in order to put the "nightmare" of her criminal case behind her and "reclaim my good life."
"My lawyers remain very confident in the strength of my appeal and will continue to pursue it on my behalf," she said in her website message.
"With your good wishes in my heart, I am looking forward to being back at work in March, and to many brighter days ahead," she added.
The Alderson prison, which has around 1050 inmates, sits in the Allegheny Mountains, some 270 miles (430 kilometers) southwest of Washington.
The facility, which has no fences, has been dubbed "Camp Cupcake" by inmates, although detainees are expected to adhere to a strict regimen.
Stewart, whose net worth was estimated at nearly one billion dollars before her stock selling scandal, will be designated work paying a maximum 40 cents an hour.
The style diva will be permitted to wear a watch valued at 100 dollars or less and a pair of earrings of similar value.
The prison is no stranger to celebrity inmates, having housed the likes of jazz singer Billie Holiday, the would be assassin of president Gerald Ford, Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme, and Kathryn Kelly, the wife of gangster "Machine Gun" Kelly.
Some local residents have been taking advantage of the media circus surrounding Stewart's internment, selling T shirts with tongue in cheek slogans like: "West Virginia.
A Great Place to Spend Time."
At her trial, prosecutors charged that Stewart was tipped off by her broker Peter Bacanovic to sell her ImClone stock in late 2001, just before a government announcement about an ImClone drug sent the share price plummeting.
Stewart and Bacanovic had argued that they had a pre existing agreement to sell the stock if the price dropped below 60 dollars a share.
After she is released from prison, Stewart will also have to undergo five months of home confinement.
Martha Stewart, the American celebrity homemaker who had her own cooking and home improvement TV show, reported to a federal prison in Alderson, West Virginia, on Friday to serve a five month sentence for lying about a stock sale.
Here are answers to some questions about the case: Q ) Why is Martha Stewart doing time?
A ) She was convicted in March of conspiring with her stockbroker to lie to federal investigators about why she unloaded shares of ImClone Systems stock in December 2001, just before the price plunged.
Q ) What happens next in the case?
A ) Stewart's lawyers hope to have the conviction overturned and must file their brief with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by Oct 20.
The appeals court will probably hear the case in early 2005.
Q ) What is her appeals argument?
A ) Her lawyers have already outlined five main points they plan to make on appeal.
Among them are allegations that a juror lied on his jury questionnaire and was biased against women, and that one of the government's own witnesses, ink expert Larry Stewart, lied on the stand.
The lawyers also plan to argue that prosecutors improperly suggested during the trial that Martha Stewart engaged in insider trading, even though she was never charged with that crime.
Q ) Stewart keeps saying she expects to be vindicated, but what are her chances?
A ) Legal observers say she faces an uphill battle.
The trial judge has already rejected motions for a new trial based on the alleged lies by the juror and the ink expert.
That judge has also written that "overwhelming independent evidence" supports the convictions.
And a jury in Manhattan acquitted Larry Stewart of perjury charges earlier this week.
Q ) Can she meet with her lawyers while she is in prison?
A ) Yes.
At Alderson, lawyers can visit during regular visiting hours 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, plus 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on Mondays and holidays.
Lawyers can also make arrangements with the prison to visit outside those hours.
There are no limits on the number of visits lawyers can make.
Q ) What will happen to the company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia?
A ) Stewart, who resigned as CEO last year but has remained a guiding force in the company, now leaves it in the hands of its management team and board of directors.
She has expressed "great confidence" in them and urged advertisers to stand by the company.
When Stewart leaves prison and begins serving five months on house arrest, she will be allowed to work a limited number of hours per week.
And reality TV show producer Mark Burnett has already signed on to refashion Stewart's lifestyle show and create other television projects around her once she's out of prison.
Home fashion guru Martha Stewart said on Friday that she has adjusted to prison life and is keeping busy behind bars since reporting a week ago to a federal penal camp in West Virginia, where she is serving a five month sentence for lying about a stock sale.
The celebrity homemaker said she was touched by the outpouring of support she has received from millions of people who have visited her Web site, according to a letter posted by Stewart on www.marthatalks.com.
Stewart, who reported to Alderson Federal Prison Camp before sunrise last Friday, said life at the camp held few surprises.
"The camp is fine, it is pretty much what I anticipated," she said in her Internet posting.
"The best news everyone is nice both the officials and my fellow inmates," the letter continued.
"I have adjusted and am very busy.
The camp is like an old fashioned college campus without the freedom, of course."
Stewart, 63, was convicted last March of lying to investigators about why she sold stock in a biotech drug maker in December 2001, just before its price plunged.
The home fashion mogul is continuing to appeal her conviction.
WASHINGTON Members of Congress who once counted on super lobbyist Jack Abramoff to help finance their campaigns have begun returning the cash they got from him and his clients, signaling a growing worry that ethics and the scandal surrounding Abramoff will become issues that could affect close House and Senate races in next year's midterm elections.
Abramoff, a powerful Washington figure who owned a tony restaurant frequented by members of Congress, is under federal investigation for allegedly swindling American Indian tribes out of millions of dollars in lobbying fees and contributions to Abramoff's associates.
With a court date looming Jan 9 and the possibility that Abramoff will cut a deal with prosecutors before that date at least two dozen lawmakers have refunded money they fear could look tainted by Election Day in November.
"They're obviously worried," said Michael Malbin, director of the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute.
"If people get disgusted by the relationship between the people in power and the lobbyists, Abramoff is going to become their poster boy."
If a lawmaker is not personally tied to any possible illegal activity involving Abramoff, then giving the money back could burnish his or her image with voters, Malbin said.
But if, as many political analysts suspect, some senators or House members are linked to Abramoff and potentially illegal activity, Malbin said, then "returning the check won't begin to take care of the problem."
Montana Senators Max Baucus, a Democrat, and Conrad Burns, a Republican, were the latest to return Abramoff connected cash.
Baucus returned $18892, including $1892 he had failed to report for use of Abramoff's skybox at a Washington, D.C., sports arena.
Burns, who has been targeted by Democrats in November's election, gave back $150000 in contributions before Christmas, reversing an earlier position that he would not return the money.
"The contributions given to my political committees by Jack Abramoff and his clients, while legal and fully disclosed, have served to undermine the public's confidence in its government," Burns said in a statement explaining his reversal.
A Burns aide said the senator has not been implicated in any of the Abramoff investigations, and has not hired a lawyer to handle the case.
Abramoff's dealings are the subject of a Senate probe and a criminal investigation.
Among the deals being scrutinized are contributions from the tribes who hired Abramoff to politicians and political groups associated with him, and overseas trips paid for by Abramoff and involving Tom DeLay, former House majority leader and Republican of Texas, among other political figures.
Capitol Hill sources have also suggested that Abramoff gave free meals and drinks at his restaurant to lawmakers, in violation of a congressional rule barring gifts worth more than $50.
Some political strategists and congressmen believe it's not necessary to return campaign donations simply because the contributor is under investigation.
Carl Forti, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said the committee has not recommend to GOP candidates that they return money from Abramoff or his clients.
But on Capitol Hill, lawmakers are uneasy, worried that any connection to Abramoff could become a campaign liability that far outweighs the campaign help he may have given them.
Senator Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who, like Burns, sits on a congressional committee that oversees Indian tribes' issues, returned $67000 in Abramoff related donations a few days before Burns and Baucus gave back their campaign cash.
"Members of Congress try to hold onto as much money as possible, until it becomes politically distasteful to hold onto it," said David Donnelly, national campaigns director for the Public Campaign Action Fund.
He predicted that lawmakers who accepted contributions from Abramoff may face serious questions from their constituents on the campaign trail.
"What it does is shine a very bright light on our campaign finance system," he said.
Democrats intend to make ethics an issue against Republicans in next year's elections, using the indictments of DeLay on money laundering charges unrelated to the Abramoff probe, and former vice presidential aide I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby for allegedly lying to a grand jury, to paint the GOP as a party immersed in scandal.
New Hampshire Democrats have hounded the state's GOP representatives, Charles Bass and Jeb Bradley, to give back contributions they received from a DeLay political action committee.
Bradley has returned such campaign contributions, Bass hasn't, but has called for DeLay to be replaced as the House leader.
Democratic strategists compare the current series of Republican ethics headaches to the House banking scandal in the early 1990s, when dozens of lawmakers were found to have repeatedly written bad personal checks on their House bank accounts, some racking up hundreds of thousands of dollars in overdrafts without penalties.
Democrats believe the ensuing voter anger contributed to their loss of dozens of seats in 2004, giving control of the chamber to Republicans.
The Abramoff and DeLay cases, Democrats believe, could help them pick up some seats next year and perhaps even regain majority control of the House.
"My sense of this is that voters are cynical and angry to start, and that more scandal just makes matters worse," said Peter Fenn, a veteran Democratic consultant and former congressional staffer.
He noted that former House speaker Jim Wright, Democrat of Texas, was forced to resign from Congress in 1989 because lobbyists bought large quantities of his books, then handed them out at fund raisers.
The Abramoff case "is clearly a much bigger scandal than the House bank or a book," Fenn said.
But while DeLay limited his handouts to fellow Republicans, Abramoff spread his money around to lawmakers and candidates in both parties.
According to an analysis prepared by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, Abramoff and his clients doled out more than $4.4 million to candidates since 2000, with $1.5 million of the money going to Democrats.
While Democrats seek to taint Burns with the Abramoff scandal, the National Republican Senatorial Committee has gone on the offense, pointing out that Abramoff gave cash not only to Baucus, but to Harry Reid of Nevada, Senate minority leader and the Democrats' leader.
A onetime congressional staffer who became a top partner to lobbyist Jack Abramoff pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe a congressman and other public officials and agreed to pay back more than $19 million he fraudulently charged Indian tribal clients.
Scanlon, a 35 year old former public relations executive who was once press secretary to then House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R Texas, faces a maximum five years in prison and a $250000 fine, but the penalty could be reduced depending on the level of his cooperation with prosecutors.
His help is expected to be crucial to the Justice Department's wide ranging Abramoff investigation, which began early last year after the revelation that Scanlon and the lobbyist took in tens of millions of dollars from Indian tribes unaware of their secret partnership to jack up fees and split profits.
Investigators are looking at half a dozen members of Congress, current and former senior Capitol Hill aides, a former deputy secretary of the interior, and Abramoff's former lobbying colleagues, according to sources familiar with the probe who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Because of his central role in much of Abramoff's business, Scanlon could be a key witness in any trials that arise from the case.
He admitted that he or Abramoff offered bribes on behalf of clients over a period of four years.
President George W. Bush's re election campaign is returning thousands of dollars in campaign contributions connected to Jack Abramoff, the Republican lobbyist who has admitted to bribing lawmakers in a case that is leading to a widespread corruption probe involving top Washington officials.
White House press secretary Scott McClellan said Wednesday that Abramoff, his wife and the Indian tribal associates that he worked for, donated thousands to the Bush Cheney 2004 campaign.
The campaign will turn the donations over to the American Heart Association, McClellan said, adding that has been the policy in similar situations in the past.
Abramoff raised at least $100000 (euro82700) for Bush's re election effort.
It was unclear how much exactly the campaign would be giving to charity since McClellan referred questions about the matter to the Republican National Committee, which did not immediately return phone calls about it.
McClellan said Bush does not know Abramoff, although it's possible that the two met at three holiday receptions Abramoff attended at the White House, McClellan said.
Abramoff has agreed to tell prosecutors and the FBI about alleged bribes to lawmakers and their aides on issues ranging from Internet gambling to wireless phone service in the House of Representatives.
He faces up to 11 years in prison.
The full extent of the investigation is not yet known, but Justice Department officials said Tuesday they intended to make use of the trove of e mails and other material in Abramoff's possession as part of a probe that is believed to be focusing on as many as 20 members of Congress and aides.
"The corruption scheme with Mr Abramoff is very extensive and we will continue to follow it wherever it leads," said Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher, head of the Justice Department's criminal division.
The political ramifications of the Abramoff probe were apparent, with minority Democrats intending to make ethics a campaign issue in this election year.
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Abramoff's confession in court was "not a surprise because this Republican Congress is the most corrupt in history and the American people are paying the price."
Some political consultants and analysts are comparing potential damage from the Abramoff investigation to the 1992 House of Representatives banking scandal that led to the retirement or ouster of 77 lawmakers.
Court papers in Abramoff's case refer to an aide to then House Majority Leader Tom DeLay who helped stop anti gambling legislation regarding the Internet.
Abramoff, the papers state, paid the staffer's wife $50000 (euro41400) from clients that benefited from the actions of the staffer, identified by a person close to the investigation as Tony Rudy, DeLay's former deputy chief of staff.
The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the probe is ongoing.
Rudy did not return a phone call Tuesday at his lobbying firm.
DeLay voted against his party on the Internet anti gambling legislation which was designed to make it easier for authorities to stop online gambling sites.
DeLay attorney Richard Cullen said he believes that when the investigation is completed and the truth is known that the Justice Department will conclude that his client, who had risen to House majority leader before stepping down from the post last year, did nothing wrong.
Abramoff pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy, mail fraud and tax evasion, with his conduct outlined in court papers that refers to "a stream of things of value to public officials in exchange for a series of official acts and influence."
On Wednesday, Abramoff was to plead guilty in Miami to criminal charges stemming from Abramoff's 2000 purchase of SunCruz Casinos, a case that touches on Rep Bob Ney, a Republican.
Abramoff's cooperation has made lawmakers nervous.
House Speaker Dennis Hastert became the most recent addition to the roster of politicians announcing plans to donate Abramoff's campaign contributions to charity.
The court papers in the Washington case refer to Ney, saying that regarding SunCruz, the congressman placed a statement drafted by Abramoff partner Michael Scanlon in the Congressional Record.
The statement, the court papers say, was calculated to pressure the owner of SunCruz to sell on terms favorable to Abramoff.
Ney denies wrongdoing, saying that "at the time I dealt with Jack Abramoff, I obviously did not know, and had no way of knowing, the self serving and fraudulent nature of Abramoff's activities."
Abramoff and his former partner, Adam Kidan, are charged with concocting a false $23 million (euro19 million) wire transfer making it appear they contributed a sizable stake of their own cash into the $147.5 million (euro122.1 million) purchase of cruise ships.
The White Buffalo Woman Calf Society, a center for battered women in tiny Mission, S.D., is far removed from the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal that rocked Washington this week.
But the society, along with many other charities large and small, is about to become a beneficiary of Abramoff's legendary largess.
As panicked lawmakers rush to distance themselves from Abramoff after his guilty pleas in federal and state courts, tens of thousands of dollars in political donations from the disgraced Republican lobbyist and his Indian tribe clients are being returned or redirected to charities in a vast Robin Hood like reordering of campaign funds.
Many of these charitable groups including the White Buffalo Woman Calf Society, which will receive $2000 from Sen John Thune, R S.D. have American Indian ties, creating a certain symmetry, albeit an imperfect one, given that Abramoff has pleaded guilty to bilking the tribes of millions.
Some tribes like the Saginaw Chippewa and the Mississippi band of Choctaw Indians are getting campaign contributions back.
But the refunds are not entirely welcome, tribal officials complain of being branded as pariahs and worry that their clout in Washington will be diminished if lawmakers refuse to accept their money.
Yet the Abramoff plea bargain has been a boon to organizations as varied as the Boy Scouts and the Mississippi Hurricane Recovery Fund.
President Bush is giving $6000 to the American Heart Association.
Sen Mitch McConnell, R Ky., is giving $18500 to a Christian mission in his home state.
Sen Hillary Rodham Clinton, D N.Y., is giving $2000 to New York charities that have not been publicly identified.
Campaign finance experts say the donations are perfectly legal, so long as the original contribution did not violate the law.
As for the charities, they are happy to get the Abramoff money, if a teensy bit uncomfortable with the attendant publicity.
"If we go down the road of assessing what's in the mind and hearts of every donor, we might find ourselves in tricky waters," said Diana Aviv, president and chief executive of Independent Sector, a nonprofit group that represents more than 600 American charities.
"Part of it is to get rid of money that for them is hot.
So what are their options?
Give it back to Jack Abramoff?
I don't think so."
WASHINGTON Former high powered lobbyist Jack Abramoff, a longtime associate of top Republican leaders, pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion and agreed to cooperate with federal officials investigating political corruption in the nation's capital.
Abramoff's appearance in a federal courtroom to acknowledge his wrongdoing not only punctuated a spectacular political fall but sent a shiver across Capitol Hill, where much of the federal corruption investigation is focused in an election year that will determine control of Congress in the final year of the Bush presidency.
The Justice Department will pursue the investigation "wherever it goes," Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher told reporters at a news conference after Abramoff's court appearance.
"Government officials and government action are not for sale."
Republicans, who have controlled Capitol Hill since 1994, could be the hardest hit politically because Abramoff's links were the strongest and most numerous to members of the GOP.
Some analysts have suggested it could rival the House banking scandal that presaged the GOP takeover of Congress a dozen years ago.
The unfolding Abramoff affair "has the potential to become the biggest congressional corruption scandal in modern times," said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a non profit organization that promotes campaign finance reforms.
In court Tuesday, Abramoff acknowledged to U.S. District Court Judge Ellen Huvelle that he had engaged in a conspiracy involving "corruption of public officials."
But neither Abramoff nor his 15 page plea agreement with the Justice Department identified any of those officials by name.
And Fisher declined reporters' requests for the names as well.
However, the plea agreement detailed lavish gifts, travel and contributions that match those Abramoff gave to House Administration Committee Chairman Bob Ney, R Ohio.
In a statement released Tuesday after Abramoff's plea, Ney denied any wrongdoing in his dealings with Abramoff.
"At the time I dealt with Jack Abramoff, I obviously did not know, and had no way of knowing, the self serving and fraudulent nature of Abramoff's activities," the statement said.
Abramoff's travels with his longtime friend, former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R Texas, were already under investigation before Tuesday's plea agreement.
Abramoff also is a longtime associate of other top GOP figures, including Americans for Tax Reform founder Grover Norquist and former Christian Coalition chief Ralph Reed, now a candidate for lieutenant governor in Georgia.
He also was a top fund raiser for President Bush's re election.
Howard Dean, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, seized on Abramoff's court appearance to call on the president to return the more than $100000 that Abramoff raised for Bush's campaign.
"Jack Abramoff is an example of the abuse of power and culture of corruption that the Republicans have brought to Washington," Dean said in a statement.
However, at the White House, Bush spokesman Scott McClellan had a limited reaction to Abramoff's admissions of guilt.
"The wrongdoing that he apparently now is acknowledging he was involved in is outrageous," McClellan said.
"And if he broke laws, he needs to be held to account and he needs to be punished."
In recent weeks, Republican and Democratic lawmakers have sought to distance themselves from Abramoff, returning more than $200000 in campaign contributions he had arranged while he was earning tens of millions of dollars as a lobbyist for American Indian tribes operating gambling casinos.
The latest to do so was House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R Ill., who disclosed late Tuesday afternoon that he would donate some $70000 in Abramoff related donations to charities.
In addition to the corruption investigation in Washington, Abramoff had been facing trial on fraud charges this month in Miami in connection with the purchase of a Florida casino cruise ship company.
His co defendant in that case, Adam Kidan, agreed last month to testify against him.
"Words will not ever be able to express my sorrow and my profound regret for all my actions and mistakes," an uncharacteristically contrite Abramoff admitted to Huvelle after pleading guilty to federal charges of conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion.
"I hope I can merit forgiveness from the Almighty and those I've wronged or caused to suffer."
The plea agreement could spare Abramoff the maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, but that depends on whether he provides valuable assistance in the corruption investigation, which is believed to focus on as many as 20 people, either members of Congress or top congressional aides.
In return for such assistance, federal prosecutors will recommend a sentence of 9 1/2 to 11 years.
As part of the plea agreement, Abramoff is committed to making some $25 million in restitution to his victims and pay $1.2 million to the Internal Revenue Service for taxes he evaded.
Prosecutors allege that Abramoff and his onetime partner, Michael Scanlon, overbilled their Indian tribe clients by millions of dollars and used that money to shower golf trips, sports and concert tickets, lavish dinners, skybox fund raisers and campaign contributions on lawmakers, and the lawmakers in turn performed "a series of official acts" for Abramoff's clients.
They allege that Abramoff and Scanlon, once a top DeLay aide, who reached his own plea agreement with federal investigators last November, kept much of that money for themselves.
Abramoff's activities went "far beyond lawful lobbying to the illegal practice of paying for official acts," Fisher said at her news conference.
"The Justice Department will aggressively investigate and prosecute these types of cases which have a devastating impact on the public's trust of government."
During the last six years, Abramoff raised more than $5 million in campaign contributions, making him one of the most influential lobbyists in Washington, a city where, according to a Washington Post study last year, the number of registered lobbying firms now totals more than 2000 and the amount of money officially spent by lobbyists exceeds $2 billion.
Scott Shepard's e mail address is sshepard@coxnews.com.
Jack Abramoff liked to slip into dialogue from "The Godfather" as he led his lobbying colleagues in planning their next conquest on Capitol Hill.
In a favorite bit, he would mimic an ice cold Michael Corleone facing down a crooked politician's demand for a cut of Mafia gambling profits: "Senator, you can have my answer now if you like.
My offer is this: nothing."
The playacting provided a clue to how Abramoff saw himself the power behind the scenes who directed millions of dollars in Indian gambling proceeds to favored lawmakers, the puppet master who pulled the strings of officials in key places, the businessman who was building an international casino empire.
Abramoff is the central figure in what could become the biggest congressional corruption scandal in generations.
Justice Department prosecutors are pressing him and his lawyers to settle fraud and bribery allegations by the end of this week, sources knowledgeable about the case said.
Unless he reaches a plea deal, he faces trial Jan 9 in Florida in a related fraud case.
A reconstruction of the lobbyist's rise and fall shows that he was an ingenious dealmaker who hatched interlocking schemes that exploited the machinery of government and trampled the norms of doing business in Washington sometimes for clients but more often to serve his desire for wealth and influence.
This inside account of Abramoff's career is drawn from interviews with government officials and former associates in the lobbying shops of Preston Gates & Ellis LLP and Greenberg Traurig LLP, thousands of court and government records, and hundreds of e mails obtained by The Washington Post, as well as those released by Senate investigators.
Abramoff, now 47, had mammoth ambitions.
He sought to build the biggest lobbying portfolio in town.
He opened two restaurants close to the Capitol.
He bought a fleet of casino boats.
He produced two Hollywood movies.
He leased four arena and stadium skyboxes and dreamed of owning a pro sports team.
He was a generous patron in his Orthodox Jewish community, starting a boys' religious school in Maryland.
For a time, all things seemed possible.
Abramoff's brash style often clashed with culturally conservative Washington, but many people were drawn to his moxie and his money.
He collected unprecedented sums tens of millions of dollars from casino rich Indian tribes.
Lawmakers and their aides packed his restaurants and skyboxes and jetted off with him on golf trips to Scotland and the Pacific island of Saipan.
Abramoff offered jobs and other favors to well placed congressional staffers and executive branch officials.
He pushed his own associates for government positions, from which they, too, could help him.
He was a man of contradictions.
He presented himself as deeply religious, yet his e mails show that he blatantly deceived Indian tribes and did business with people linked to the underworld.
He had genuine inside connections but also puffed himself up with phony claims about his access.
Abramoff's lobbying team was made up of Republicans and a few Democrats, most of whom he had wined and dined when they were aides to powerful members of Congress.
They signed on for the camaraderie, the paycheck, the excitement.
"Everybody lost their minds," recalled a former congressional staffer who lobbied with Abramoff at Preston Gates.
"Jack was cutting deals all over town.
Staffers lost their loyalty to members they were loyal to money."
A senior Preston Gates partner warned him to slow down or he would be "dead, disgraced or in jail."
Those within Abramoff's circle also saw the danger signs.
Their boss had become increasingly frenzied about money and flouted the rules.
"I'm sensing shadiness.
I'll stop asking," one associate, Todd Boulanger, e mailed a colleague.
Abramoff declined to comment for this article.
"I have advised my client not to speak, except in court," said Neal Sonnett, one of his attorneys.
A friend of two decades, Rep Dana Rohrabacher, R Calif., defended Abramoff: "I think he's been dealt a bad hand and the worst, rawest deal I've ever seen in my life.
Words like bribery are being used to describe things that happened every day in Washington and are not bribes."
Few of those interviewed would agree to be quoted on the record because of the ongoing investigation by a Justice Department task force.
But some who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they look back in amazement at the heady days of Abramoff's rise.
"We weren't outside the box," the former Preston Gates colleague said.
"We were outside the universe."
Hints of Trouble A quarter of a century ago, Abramoff and anti tax crusader Grover Norquist were fellow Young Turks of the Reagan revolution.
They organized Massachusetts college campuses in the 1980 election Abramoff while he was an undergraduate at Brandeis and Norquist at Harvard Business School to help Reagan pull an upset in the state.
They moved to Washington, maneuvered to take over the College Republicans at the time a sleepy establishment organization and transformed it into a right wing activist group.
They were joined by Ralph Reed, an ambitious Georgian whose later Christian conversion would fuel his rise to national political prominence.
Soon they made headlines with such tactics as demolishing a mock Berlin Wall in Lafayette Park, where they also burned a Soviet leader in effigy.
"We want to shock them," Abramoff told The Post at the time.
They forged lifelong ties.
At Reagan's 72nd birthday party at the White House, Reed introduced Abramoff to his future wife, Pam Alexander, who was working with Reed.
She eventually converted to Judaism and embraced the Orthodox beliefs Abramoff had adopted as a teen ager.
Even in those early days, there were hints of the troubles to come.
"If anyone is not surprised at the rise and fall of Jack Abramoff, it is me," said Rich Bond, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee.
Abramoff and his crew busted the College Republicans' budget with a 1982 national direct mail fundraising campaign that ended up "a colossal flop," said Bond, then deputy director of the party's national committee.
He said he banished the three from GOP headquarters, telling Abramoff: "You can't be trusted."
Shortly thereafter, Abramoff was running Citizens for America, a conservative grass roots group founded by drug store magnate Lewis E. Lehrman.
Abramoff was in frequent contact with Marine Lt. Col Oliver L. North, the Reagan White House's Iran Contra mastermind, about grass roots efforts to lobby Congress for the Nicaraguan Contras, according to records in the National Security Archive.
One of Abramoff's most audacious adventures involved Jonas Savimbi, the Angolan rebel leader who had U.S. support but was later found to have ordered the murders of his movement's representative to the United States and that man's relatives.
With Savimbi, Abramoff organized a "convention" of anticommunist guerrillas from Laos, Nicaragua and Afghanistan in a remote part of Angola.
Afterward, Lehrman fired Abramoff amid a dispute about the handling of the group's $3 million budget.
Abramoff also worked on behalf of the apartheid South African government, which secretly paid $1.5 million a year to the International Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit group that Abramoff operated out of a townhouse in the 1980s, according to sworn testimony to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
At the same time, Abramoff dabbled as a Hollywood producer, shepherding an anticommunist movie, "Red Scorpion," starring Dolph Lundgren, filmed in Namibia, which was then ruled by South Africa.
Actors in the film said they saw South African soldiers on the set.
When the film was released in 1989, anti apartheid groups demonstrated at the theaters.
The movie ran into financial difficulty during and after production, but Abramoff produced a sequel, "Red Scorpion 2."
Mysterious Entrance When Republicans wrested control of the House from the Democrats in 1994, Abramoff turned his focus back to Washington politics.
With Norquist's help, he reinvented himself as a Republican lobbyist on heavily Democratic K Street.
Norquist was one of the intellectual architects of the Republican Revolution and a muse for its leader, Newt Gingrich, R Ga., soon to be speaker of the House.
Abramoff also counted on his father, who had a wealth of connections from his days as president of the Diners Club credit card company.
Frank Abramoff had once looked into operating a casino in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. territory that includes Saipan.
He introduced his son around, and the Marianas became one of the first important clients of the new lobbyist.
Soon the younger Abramoff developed a key alliance with Rep Tom DeLay, a conservative Republican from Texas who was working his way up in the House leadership.
The two met at a DeLay fundraiser on Capitol Hill in 1995, according to a former senior DeLay aide.
The aide recalled that Edwin A. Buckham, then DeLay's chief of staff, told his boss: "We really need to work with Abramoff, he is going to be an important lobbyist and fundraiser."
DeLay, a Christian conservative, did not quite know what to make of Abramoff, who wore a beard and a yarmulke.
They forged political ties, but the two men never became personally close, according to associates of both men.
Almost from the start, Abramoff struck some rival lobbyists as a strange figure who operated on the margins.
He even turned up as a representative of the Pakistani military when Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto went to Washington in 1995 to seek the return of $600 million the Islamabad government had paid for 28 F 16 fighters.
The sale had been blocked by the U.S. government over concerns about Pakistan's nuclear program.
Bhutto's Washington lobbyists were at the Pakistani embassy savoring her successful meeting with President Bill Clinton when a man in a suit made a mysterious entrance.
"Suddenly, this portly guy steps in and sits down.
He says nothing," recalled one of the lobbyists.
The Americans asked him to introduce himself.
He folded his arms and refused.
"Finally, he says, 'I am Jack Abramoff," recalled the lobbyist, a well connected Democrat.
They had never heard of him.
Abramoff explained that he was "close to Newt."
The astonished lobbyists for Bhutto learned that Abramoff had traveled to Islamabad and had sold his services to the Pakistani military without the prime minister's knowledge.
In the Senate, Abramoff befriended Republicans and their staffers, along with some Democrats on the appropriations committees.
In August 1999, he signed up for the National Republican Senatorial Committee's "Tartan Invitational," in which a half dozen Republican senators and their aides spent a few days with about 50 lobbyists golfing at the exclusive St. Andrews Links in Scotland.
The following year, Abramoff figured out how to use his clients to fund his own trips to St. Andrews with lawmakers.
The first guests were DeLay and his aides.
Team Abramoff With Norquist's help, Abramoff secured a spot on the transition team for the Interior Department after George W. Bush's election as president in 2000.
He tried to place several officials in Interior, including an unsuccessful attempt to land a former Marianas official in the top spot overseeing U.S. territories.
He was able to befriend J. Steven Griles, the deputy interior secretary, e mails and interviews show.
By the summer of 2001, Abramoff was referring to him in an e mail to a client as "our guy Steve Griles."
Federal investigators are now looking into whether Griles interceded on behalf of Abramoff and improperly discussed a job with the lobbyist while in a position to affect his clients.
Griles denied any wrongdoing in recent testimony to the Senate.
Abramoff's team also cultivated Roger Stillwell, the Marianas desk officer at the Interior Department.
In a recent interview, Stillwell said he accepted dinners at Abramoff's restaurant, Signatures, and tickets to Redskins games.
But he said that all those actions occurred while he was a contract employee at Interior, not a federal worker.
He also said he sent Abramoff copies of e mails he sent to his boss, but he noted that none of them contained confidential information and that "there's nothing wrong with doing that."
Abramoff wallowed in his access, real and imagined.
When his crack administrative assistant Susan Ralston bolted for a position with White House political adviser Karl Rove, Abramoff told colleagues he had gotten her the job even though it was Ralston's old boss, Reed, who made it happen, her former colleagues said.
WASHINGTON In 1981, a newly elected president was about to shift the nation rightward, and a 22 year old Brandeis graduate named Jack Abramoff savoring his own victory as the newly elected chairman of the College Republicans was hatching plans to transform the nation's young people into stalwart Reaganites.
It was the start of a career that would roil Washington 25 years later, and a phase of Abramoff's life that provided signposts toward his later demise.
"Our job," Abramoff wrote, "is to remove liberals "from power permanently from student newspaper and radio stations, student governments, and academia.
"We are replacing these leftists with committed conservatives."
As Abramoff saw it, the only hitch to his Napoleonic scale ambition was the pea sized budget that his sponsors at the Republican National Committee were willing to commit.
"With $250000 it is impossible for us to run even a skeletal field effort," Abramoff complained in a memorandum.
The memo was sent to the committee chairman, Richard Richards, after a ride in Richards's limousine back from the White House.
His money pleas unheeded, Abramoff spent the next four years, from 1981 to 1985, bypassing the RNC chain of command the organization legally responsible for the College Republicans to build his own financial juggernaut to advance the group's hard right agenda, according to memos from College Republican files and interviews with GOP officials involved.
Unbeknownst to the RNC, he launched an expensive direct mail campaign that left the group in debt, and vendors complaining about unpaid bills.
He set up at least two tax exempt groups to raise money over the objections of an RNC lawyer who warned that such groups could not legally engage in political activities.
He borrowed money for his cause, even from his father.
"Jack was a freebooting pirate as far as I was concerned," said a Washington attorney, Mark Braden, then the RNC's house counsel.
"He had a strong belief in his own correctness.
It was damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead."
More than two decades later, in early January, Abramoff became a symbol of Washington corruption when he pleaded guilty to a range of crimes committed as a lobbyist.
The scandal, which has touched off a legislative scramble for reform, could also snare members of Congress.
Looking back, Abramoff's critics inside the Republican Party say his tenure at the College Republicans should have provided a crystal ball into the turns his life might take.
"Look how the seeds of his current destruction are so evident," said Richard Bond, who as RNC deputy chairman repeatedly confronted Abramoff over spending issues.
Ronald Kaufman, then the RNC's political director, described Abramoff's management as "living on the edge,I don't think any of us thought he was an evil person.
But we were really worried about the group and the direction they were taking."
"I remember them being in debt and constantly having financial issues," said William I.
Greener III, a former RNC communications director.
"You had the sense of grabbing at air to try to get specifics and details" about where the money had gone.
Yet Abramoff also transformed the once sleepy College Republican campus clubs into a vibrant political force, enjoying access to members of Congress, especially Newt Gingrich, the little known backbencher who would later become House speaker.
"This is really a tragedy in the literal sense," said James Higgins, who succeeded Abramoff as College Republicans chairman.
"Jack could have accomplished great things with his unusual ability to lead and inspire people."
Paul Erickson, who served as the College Republicans treasurer under Abramoff, dismissed the accusations of RNC officials as untrue and ideologically based, saying Abramoff's critics were moderates allied with Vice President George H.W. Bush, who "didn't want conservatism promoted in any sense."
Abramoff's top lieutenants were two figures who would achieve their own prominence: Grover Norquist, the Harvard MBA who would become Washington's leading antitax activist, and Ralph Reed, who would build the Christian Coalition into a powerful GOP player in the 1990s.
Both remained close to Abramoff, and both have been linked to his work on behalf of Indian tribes.
An Abramoff spokesman, Andrew Blum, issued a "no comment" in response to questions for this article.
Norquist and Reed did not return telephone calls.
Neither Norquist nor Reed has been charged with wrongdoing.
But the fallout from the Abramoff scandal has hurt their reputations, and ethical questions now cloud Reed's race for Georgia's lieutenant governor.
The Reagan pilgrimage In the summer of 1981, Abramoff, Norquist, and Reed joined thousands of young conservatives flocking to the nation's capital, following a 70 year old former movie actor who offered sustenance for their patriotic hunger.
Under Reagan, there would be no more talk of "peaceful coexistence" with America's Cold War enemies.
"The time is now," Reagan proclaimed, "to recapture our destiny."
Young conservatives were enthralled, after years of feeling alienated on liberal college campuses.
In Washington, they continued to view themselves as underdogs battling the dominant liberal political and media culture.
But they brought to their cause the same question authority irreverence that had been the hallmark of leftist baby boomers.
While the College Republicans had been a one time homeground for strategists such as Lee Atwater and Karl Rove, the organization by 1980 suffered from sagging membership and political clout.
Abramoff's election as chairman after a campaign that cost him $10000 changed all that.
He and Norquist brought to Washington the same energy they had applied to organizing Massachusetts campuses for Reagan.
They could, and did, take credit for helping orchestrate Reagan's victory in Massachusetts a state so liberal it stood alone in George McGovern's 1972 column.
Under Abramoff, the College Republicans office quickly became a nesting ground for hard right believers.
The new team, allies recalled, berated Republican moderates as "Bushyites" a reference to the vice president and "squishes" who were too eager to cut deals with Democrats on Capitol Hill, or with the Russians at superpower summits.
After purging the moderates in the College Republican hierarchy, Abramoff and his team launched a series of events to build public support for Reagan's foreign policy.
The first was its "Poland Will Be Free" campaign to support the democracy movement then under siege by the Polish communist government.
But in the eyes of the College Republicans, the Polish regime wasn't the only Moscow puppet so, too, were liberal student groups, the American media, leftist professors, and nuclear freeze activists.
Abramoff distributed on campuses 900 copies of a book called "Target America," which posited that the Soviets had planted 4000 journalist agents in the American media to pursue a "massive secret propaganda campaign," according to memos.
A training manual from the period, which Reed helped to write, described Ralph Nader's network of Public Interest Research Groups on campus as "tyrannical" and "radical."
Abramoff's team accused the United States Student Association a 350 chapter liberal campus group that in 1982 protested Reagan's student aid cuts of being a "pro Soviet, pro terrorist, Marxist Leninist organization."
The manual advised boycotting "Marxist" professors, and soliciting support from alumni college donors to oust them.
That kind of charged rhetoric repeatedly landed Abramoff in "hot water" with RNC officials, as RNC communications director Greener noted in a 1983 memo.
"Bad use of words!"
Greener scribbled on an Abramoff memo that described efforts to "smash" PIRGs and Uni d States Student Association chapters, and "drive the final nail into their coffin sometime within the next year."
Abramoff was admonished by RNC official Bond after a letter to the Palestine Liberation Organization went out over RNC stationery, according to a memo.
"It got to the point where the CR's played it like a war and Republican leaders rolled their eyes," Kaufman said.
"You couldn't trust them not to get in trouble."
That lack of trust extended to finances.
Memos from the period revealed Abramoff's intense focus on fund raising and his readiness to use the connections of his Beverly Hills based father, a Diners Club executive with connections to Reagan's kitchen cabinet.
"Alfred Bloomingdale, a close personal friend of my family, told me to contact you immediately," Abramoff wrote to Roy Cohn, Joseph McCarthy's one time counsel, on July 8, 1981.
"Although we are an arm of the RNC, we must become financially self sufficient."
Abramoff added that "because of his close association with the President, Mr Bloomingdale was able to free up the RNC contributor list for our use.
Within the next couple of weeks, we must raise $50000 in order to mail and phone bank these lists.
I have no doubt that we will pyramid that $50000, to over $1 million within the first year."
Bond, now a former RNC official, characterized Abramoff's assertion that he had gained access to the RNC contributor list as "outside the realm of reality.
That list is like the Holy Grail ,You can see his early prevarication."
Bloomingdale died in 1982.
Champing at the RNC bit Like other RNC affiliates groups that represent GOP women, African Americans, and the like the College Republicans were allocated an annual budget.
Abramoff's defenders say he was trying to build a far more potent political force than other affiliates, with a national program to train conservative activists.
"We fought, begged, and pleaded" for more funding, recalled Erickson.
"We were sick to death of being on the RNC leash."
In October, Abramoff sent a letter to state College Republican chairs urging them to raise money through direct mail.
By the early 1980s, direct mail had become a popular fund raising tool for political groups, particularly on the right.
But it was also costly, and would lead to the demise of a number of New Right groups.
A year later, the College Republicans had accumulated "rather large debt" as Abramoff wrote in a November 1982 memo to a second direct mail vendor.
Memos indicate that three months earlier, in the summer of 1982, bills were going unpaid.
"Dear Sirs," Abramoff wrote to a printer.
"I would just like to inform you of a thirty day hold we are having on all of our billing due to an interruption in our steady cash flow situation."
The precise amount of the debt was unclear from memos, as well as the memories of RNC officials.
But, Bond said, "speculative direct mail" by the College Republicans was "completely unauthorized."
So were loans to the College Republicans, but a July 1982 memo from Abramoff to his father, Frank, shows that he borrowed $5000 for the group.
"If I had known the CRs were out getting loans from people that they potentially couldn't pay back, I would have stopped them dead in their tracks," said Bond.
Determined to find financial footing independent of the RNC, Abramoff proposed setting up a separate group, the College Republican National Fund, whose income would be tax exempt.
But in a March 1982 memo, Braden, the RNC counsel, told Abramoff such a group would skirt tax laws.
"Such organizations may not engage directly or indirectly in political activities," Braden wrote.
"I received last week a print order for stationery for the College Republican National Fund.
This activity cannot be funded through College Republicans, nor will the RNC permit the use of its facilities for these purposes."
Memos show that Abramoff set up the fund anyway.
As one solicitation suggests, the fund had clear political intent.
"Thank you so much for your contribution to the College Republican National Fund," Abramoff wrote to a Florida donor.
"Because of your generous donation we were able to fight Teddy Kennedy in Massachusetts.
Due to our efforts and other circumstances, Kennedy will not plague us in 1984."
The College Republican tactics and unpaid bills led the RNC to demand that Abramoff leave the building and move the group elsewhere, former RNC officials said.
"Jack was a difficult person to work with from a lawyer's point of view," Braden said.
Disturbed by the College Republican operation, "we threw him out.
I don't remember what precipitated it, but I remember the incident .
It was painful.
He was a very difficult personality.
There were all types of management problems and a lack of trust between us and them."
Bond and Kaufman also recalled asking Abramoff to move out.
Erickson, then a student who was elected College Republican treasurer under Abramoff in 1983, disputed this version of events, saying the RNC was reclaiming prime office space from the College Republicans and other affiliates.
Former RNC officials, he said, have an ax to grind.
"It was open warfare in the halls of the RNC between the Reaganites and the Bushyites," said Erickson.
"Bond and Kaufman were fiercely loyal to Bush and loathed Ronald Reagan."
"It had zero to do with ideology," Kaufman countered.
Greener, an early Reagan supporter who says he was "not a Bushie in any way, shape or form," also recalled that the disputes centered on the College Republicans' financial troubles and unanswered questions about where the money had gone.
"You could never get a straight answer," he said.
Dissent within the ranks Questions about Abramoff's financial management prompted rumors to circulate within the organization.
One competitor in Abramoff's 1983 race for reelection accused Abramoff not only of generating a debt but of embezzling money that he had deposited into a Swiss bank account.
Nothing came of the claims, but they prompted one Abramoff supporter to issue a letter to College Republican convention delegates rebutting these "personal attacks and character smears."
A short time after leaving the RNC building, Abramoff set up another nonprofit, the USA Foundation, soliciting money from such New Right donors as the Olin Foundation.
Although he organized it as a nonpartisan, tax exempt group, Abramoff served as chairman of both the foundation and the College Republicans.
In 1984, the foundation helped organize "Student Liberation Day" in support of Reagan's invasion of Grenada.
On College Republican stationery, Abramoff wrote: "While the Student Liberation Day Coalition is nonpartisan and intended only for educational purposes, I don't need to tell you how important this project is to our efforts as CRs.
I am confident that an impartial study of the contrasts between the Carter/Mondale failure in Iran and the Reagan victory in Grenada will be most enlightening to voters 12 days before the general election."
By then, the College Republicans had been banished not only from the RNC premises but also from the Reagan White House.
At the close of the Student Liberation Day celebration, Abramoff, Erickson, and others traveled to the White House to attend a reception for the American medical students who had been rescued in the invasion.
They were blocked.
"Deaver had crossed us off the list," Erickson recalled in a reference to the Reagan adviser, Michael Deaver.
A year later, Abramoff left the College Republicans to pursue other ventures.
By then, his four year tenure had made him a divisive figure.
Erickson defended Abramoff, saying he was promoting the cause of Reagan conservatism, not getting rich.
"Jack governed by sheer force of will," Erickson said.
"Things happened because Jack willed them to happen."
His detractors at the RNC took a different view.
Greener said: "I have found in life that individuals who believe what they are doing is so right and so good and so important are also the individuals that have a high frequency level of rationalizing away unacceptab behavior."
Nina J. Easton is the author of the 2002 book "Gang of Five."
Some descriptions were drawn from the book, but all interviews took place this year.
E mails uncovered by a Senate committee show superlobbyist Jack Abramoff had a keen interest in Rep John Doolittle's unsuccessful effort to block approval of the United Auburn Indian Community's Thunder Valley casino in Placer County, Calif.
Abramoff, whom Doolittle described as a close friend, had a tribal client thousands of miles away in Louisiana that could have benefited from the precedent if Doolittle and other critics succeeded in persuading the U.S. Department of Interior to stop Thunder Valley in 2002.
It's unclear whether the e mails sparked the Justice Department's reported interest in Doolittle, R Calif., as its corruption investigation digs deeper into Abramoff's connections on Capitol Hill.
But nothing in the e mails and other documents uncovered by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee's probe of the scandal proves Doolittle and Abramoff were working together on the tribal cases.
Doolittle's office, moreover, denied the congressman coordinated efforts with Abramoff on the United Auburn casino, which ultimately opened in 2003.
Doolittle spokeswoman Laura Blackann said the congressman arranged meetings between the Interior Department and local government officials but said he did not attend.
Abramoff was watching the United Auburn case closely because the Interior Department ruling on it could become a damaging precedent for his clients, the Louisiana Coushattas, who were trying to torpedo a Louisiana casino proposed by the Jena Band of Choctaws.
In both the Jena and United Auburn matters, the Interior Department was being asked to take non Indian land into trust essentially accepting title to lands on the tribes' behalf so that they would qualify for a casino under an exception to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
The United Auburn matter came to a head midway through the 2001 2002 election cycle in which Abramoff and his tribal clients contributed about $30000 to Doolittle's campaign committees and just months before the congressman's wife, Julie Doolittle, was hired in August 2002 to do fundraising and event planning for an Abramoff foundation.
But those working on behalf of the United Auburn tribe said Doolittle did not fully flex his political muscle with the Bush administration to try to kill the casino another sign that Doolittle was not necessarily advancing Abramoff's interests.
"We would rather that he had done nothing, obviously," Howard Dickstein, the Auburn tribe's attorney, said of Doolittle.
"But what he did was ineffectual."
Still, the e mails obtained by the Indian Affairs Committee, chaired by Sen John McCain, R Ariz., show Abramoff was extremely interested in what was happening with the United Auburn request.
Italia Federici, head of the Council of Republicans for Environmental Advocacy, which was receiving large contributions from Abramoff clients at the time, sent a message to Interior Secretary Gale Norton's communications director in February 2001 that Doolittle was working with Christian Coalition Director Ralph Reed "on the California and Louisiana situations."
"It looks like Doolittle is not giving up and that the conservatives a(re) being mobilized," Federici wrote.
A year later, Abramoff WCexpressed concern in an e mail to Federici: The Interior Department was about to approve the land deal for the United Auburn casino, suggesting that he saw it as a precedent that could "screw" his clients.
"I am really worried about this," Abramoff wrote.
"What can we do?"
A week after that, Abramoff associate Tony Rudy, former chief of staff to Texas Rep Tom DeLay, wrote Abramoff that Interior Deputy Secretary Steven Griles was angry about them "bashing Norton" over the United Auburn decision when, in fact, the Interior Department had no other choice "because of the way Doolittle wrote the bill" restoring Auburn's tribal status in 1994.
"He seems to be distinguishing how Norton would handle Jena (I hope)," Rudy wrote, then added that Abramoff's team was going to have to be "mega careful" on how they lobby the department.
"Things are too hot right now," Rudy warned Abramoff.
The 1994 bill to which Rudy referred restored the Auburn Rancheria's tribal rights only after Doolittle had been assured the tribe wasn't going to get into gambling.
When the tribe changed its mind, Doolittle rushed through an amendment on a year end spending bill that would give local governments a stronger say in how such a casino was developed.
A 1997 Doolittle bill barring a casino near schools and churches and requiring agreements with local governments failed in the Senate, but became the basis for a negotiated deal between the tribe and Placer County on the location where the Thunder Valley casino was eventually built.
Other e mails revealed that Abramoff and his associates were lobbying Griles hard at the Interior Department, and in 2003 had even offered him a job, though Griles testified that he doesn't remember it that way.
Some at the Interior Department were suspicious that there was unusual attention being paid to the United Auburn request.
Michael Rosetti, who was legal counsel to Norton, testified at the committee that he smelled something fishy about the way the last minute questions about the United Auburn casino were drawing Griles' attention, because Griles' duties at Interior did not include tribal gambling.
"All of a sudden there were meetings that Steve Griles was chairing which had as its constituent members people from the adjacent communities in the California area ,I thought it was odd," he said.
"I didn't know on whose behalf he had interceded precisely and on whose behalf Mr Griles was exercising that inquiry."
Griles, whose memory was fuzzy on just about everything, told the committee that he met with Auburn casino critics because of an inquiry from a congressman, although he didn't name Doolittle.
"I don't know the Auburn Rancheria," Griles testified.
"Whenever I was asked by the congressional office at Interior to meet with certain members of Congress, I would do that.
Out of that they would ask me to meet with certain constituents."
The meeting to which Rosetti and Griles appear to be referring occurred with Bureau of Indian Affairs officials in mid to late January 2002, according to former Roseville Mayor Claudia Gamar Heinlein, who attended it along with representatives from Rocklin and Lincoln.
She doesn't recall whether Griles attended.
"We thought the meeting had gone well, that they listened to our concerns and were going to look into some things," Gamar Heinlein said.
"We were really surprised when a couple of days later they announced that the department was taking (the Auburn casino site) into trust without contacting anybody."
But Gamar Heinlein said the only help the Auburn casino critics got was from Doolittle, who helped arrange the meeting for the group but did not attend or send a representative.
While the e mails reveal that Abramoff saw a precedent for the Coushattas if the Auburn deal was rejected, Dickstein said the fact that Doolittle was not at the January meeting signaled that the congressman was not going to battle the Interior Department over it.
"We had heard rumors that (White House political strategist) Karl Rove had been called, that Doolittle had set up a meeting with Griles and these e mails confirm that in my mind for the first time," he said.
"But it was significant to us that he did not actually attend the meeting," he said.
"We thought it was a sign that he was not going to go to the mat over this."
Doolittle's office essentially agreed.
"The congressman recognized that the tribe had unprecedented agreements with Placer County and the city of Lincoln that addressed many of the concerns of his constituents," Blackann said.
"As such, the congressman was not personally involved in these meetings."
Further, Dickstein said he knows of no involvement by Reed, the Christian Coalition or any other Abramoff connected groups lobbying against the United Auburn decision.
"They were just getting organized right at the time we were very far along in getting this approved," Dickstein said.
"It was as if they were just waking up to something that was essentially a done deal."
Blackann said Doolittle never coordinated with Reed and the Christian Coalition, as the Federici memo indicated.
"The congressman has never talked to Ralph Reed regarding Indian gaming issues, and we are unaware of what Ms Federici is specifically referring to in her memo other than the congressman's long held opposition to the expansion of gaming in this country," Blackann said.
Former lobbyist Jack Abramoff's second guilty plea in two days sealed his role as a star witness in the federal government's largest congressional corruption investigation in decades.
Abramoff Wednesday admitted in U.S. District Court in Miami that he engaged in fraud and conspiracy in his purchase of a fleet of casino boats in 2000, when he presented lenders with a counterfeit document showing that he and a partner had put $23 million into the deal.
In fact, Abramoff and partner Adam Kidan put virtually no money into the purchase, and the cruise line went bankrupt the following year.
The appearance was made a day after Abramoff pleaded guilty in Washington to defrauding Indian tribal clients, conspiring to bribe members of Congress and evading taxes.
The Florida and Washington cases were resolved together in an agreement that requires the ex lobbyist to provide evidence and testimony in the Justice Department's probe of corruption in Congress and executive branch agencies.
Kidan and another Abramoff partner, Michael Scanlon, already have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
Prosecutors are now expected to turn their attention to congressional aides and former Capitol Hill staffers who went to work for Abramoff in order to learn more about the actions of members of Congress.
While Abramoff's cooperation is a major boon to prosecutors, his admissions of fraud this week also could provide ammunition against him if he testifies against lawmakers, some ethics lawyers said.
"He defrauded the tribes, he defrauded his law firms, so why isn't it that he defrauded public officials as well?" said Jan W. Baran, an attorney at Wiley Rein & Fielding.
"Proving somebody accepted campaign contributions and expense paid trips and then did something of benefit for Abramoff is not in and of itself proving bribery."
To make a bribery case against a legislator, prosecutors would need to prove that lawmakers knew Abramoff's gifts were in exchange for specific actions.
Many legislators under investigation, such as Rep Robert W. Ney, R Ohio, have denied any wrongdoing and have said that, like the tribes, they were defrauded by Abramoff.
"I think it is bigger than any congressional scandal I can remember and certainly politically it touches hundreds of members," said Kenneth Gross, a former Federal Election Commission attorney.
"Still, I think it is a tough case.
This is by no means a slam dunk for the government, even with Abramoff part of the prosecution team now."
The legal standard for proving bribery is high because of a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in 1999 requiring prosecutors to show that gifts were given for specific government action.
In the case, the court threw out the conviction of Sun Diamond, a California cooperative accused of illegally showering Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy with sports tickets, meals and other gifts.
The court said it was not enough that the cooperative had two regulatory issues before the department.
"The standard that was set forth in the Espy case set a very high bar for quid pro quo and corrupt intent," Gross said.
Attorneys, however, noted that there are key differences in the Abramoff case.
"In Espy, they didn't have the equivalent of an Abramoff or Scanlon connecting the dots," Gross said.
"Here they are armed with that additional arsenal in that case."
Stanley M. Brand, a former House counsel who was involved in the Sun Diamond case, said that the Abramoff investigation appears to exceed the standard set by the Supreme Court.
"In a case of nuance, when you don't have eyewitnesses who are participants in a transaction, you have a problem," Brand said.
"In this case, you do.
The jury will have no problem convicting if they have three eyewitnesses."
Abramoff's sentence in the Florida case is to be served concurrently with the penalty in the Washington case.
If he lives up to the terms of his plea agreement, he is expected to face about 10 years in prison.
R. Alexander Acosta, the acting U.S. attorney in Miami, said the Florida investigation is continuing, led by Assistant U.S. Attorney Lawrence LaVecchio.
Florida prosecutors are working closely with attorneys from the Department of Justice's fraud and public integrity sections, who are overseeing a multiagency task force of 35 to 40 lawyers and investigators.
In Washington, the case is being run by Noel Hillman and Mary K. Butler of the public integrity section, and acting fraud section chief Paul E. Pelletier, along with prosecuting attorney Guy D. Singer.
One of the key investigative strands that involves authorities in Florida and Washington is the investigation of Ney, chairman of the House Administration Committee.
Ney, who received favors and contributions from Abramoff, placed comments in the Congressional Record that pressured SunCruz's owner, Konstantinos "Gus" Boulis, to sell his fleet to Abramoff and Kidan.
Boulis died in a gangland style hit a few months later.
Three men, including two associates of Kidan, have been charged in the killing.

The biggest public corruption scandal in a generation Tuesday took down one of the best connected lobbyists in Washington.
The question echoing around the capital was what other careers and what other familiar ways of doing business are endangered.
Jack Abramoff represented the most flamboyant and extreme example of a brand of influence trading that flourished after the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives 11 years ago.
Now, some GOP strategists fear that the fallout from his case could affect the party's efforts to keep control in the November mid term elections.
Abramoff was among the lobbyists most closely associated with the K Street Project, which was initiated by his friend, former House majority leader Tom DeLay, R Texas, once the GOP vaulted to power.
It was an aggressive program designed to force corporations and trade associations to hire more GOP connected lobbyists in what at times became an almost seamless relationship between Capitol Hill lawmakers and some firms that sought to influence them.
Now Abramoff has become a symbol of a system out of control.
His agreement to plead guilty to three criminal counts and cooperate with prosecutors threatens to ensnare other lawmakers or their aides Republicans and possibly some Democrats.
At a minimum, Tuesday's developments put both sides of the lawmaker lobbyist relationship on notice that some of the wilder customs of recent years lubricated with money, entertainment and access carry higher risks.
In the post Abramoff era, what once was accepted as business as usual may be seen as questionable or worse.
"In the short run, members of Congress will get allergic to lobbyists," said former representative Vin Weber, R Minn., now a lobbyist for Clark & Weinstock.
"They'll be nervous about taking calls and holding meetings, to say nothing of lavish trips to Scotland.
Those will be out.
For a period of time now, members of Congress will be concerned about even legitimate contact with the lobbying world."
The initial impact of a scandal that earlier produced a guilty plea from Abramoff associate Michael Scanlon could be changes in the way lawmakers and lobbyists interact.
In the longer term, said many lobbyists and others, Congress will be pressured to revisit and toughen rules on gifts and travel that lawmakers and their staffs may accept.
Some former lawmakers said even bigger changes may be needed to restore public confidence in how Washington works.
Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, R Ga., who with Weber's help effectively used issues of corruption to wrest control of the House from Democrats in 1994, said the Abramoff scandal should trigger a broader review in Congress of the way politicians finance campaigns and deal with lobbyists.
"I'm going to talk at length about the need for us to rethink not just lobbying but the whole process of elections, incumbency protection and the way in which the system has evolved," he said.
"Which is very different from the way the American system is supposed to be like.
I think Abramoff is just part of a large pattern that has got to be rethought."
Emotions ran high on K Street Tuesday when news of Abramoff's plea deal began to break.
"The Abramoff scandal is causing a re examination of what lobbyists do in town," said R. Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
"I wouldn't be surprised to see lawmakers become cautious in meetings with lobbyists."
With an eye on November's elections, Republicans have sought to limit the damage to themselves by portraying the scandal as bipartisan, describing Abramoff as an equal opportunity dispenser of campaign cash and largesse.
So far the public has not identified corruption as solely a Republican problem.
A November Washington Post ABC News poll asked Americans whether they thought Democrats or Republicans were better on ethical matters, 16 percent said Democrats, 12 percent said Republicans and 71 percent said there was not much difference between the two parties.
But Republicans worry about two possibilities.
The first is that Abramoff, known for his close ties to DeLay, mostly implicates Republicans as a result of his plea agreement.
That could shift public attitudes sharply against the GOP.
"People are uneasy about what else is out there," said one GOP strategist who requested anonymity to speak more candidly about the possible political fallout.
Beyond that, however, is a fear that the scandal and that attention it could draw in the months before the election further sours the public on Washington and Congress.
As the party in power, Republicans know they stand to lose more if voters take retribution in November.
Regardless of the electoral implications, the Abramoff scandal may force changes on Capitol Hill in the form of tough new lobbying disclosure laws that even some lobbying advocates say it is time to consider.
"There will be a push for increased oversight and disclosure of lobbying," said Douglas Pinkham, president of the Public Affairs Council, a lobbyist education group.
"There needs to be greater transparency and better enforcement."
Sens John McCain, R Ariz., and Russell Feingold, D Wis., who co wrote campaign finance changes a few years ago, have introduced separate proposals that would crack down hard on lobbying as now practiced.
Their ideas will serve as the starting point for what is expected to be a vigorous debate.
Some lobbyists reacted defensively Tuesday, at pains to say that Abramoff was an exception to the way they do business.
"The Abramoff style is so far afield from the normal course of business as to be irrelevant to me and probably most people in my line of work," said Joel Johnson, a Clinton White House official and now a lobbyist for the Glover Park Group.
"The whole Abramoff matter is atypical," agreed Ed Rogers of Barbour Griffith & Rogers.
"It is not a lesson of how business is done in Washington."
John Jonas, a lobbyist at Patton Boggs, said he expects "less partying, less gifting, more awareness about compliance" with rules that have been "observed in the breach."
As for the perception of lobbying as a profession, "It's confirmed everybody's worst fears about lobbyists that they double deal, that they're not aboveboard," Jonas said.
"That hurts the legitimate practice of the profession."
Gingrich said Republican leaders in Congress should take the initiative to reform lobbying and campaign finance, rather than hoping to slip quietly past the current scandal.
"Things have to be done to really rethink where the center of the political process is," he said.
"Right now, the center is a lobbying and PAC (political action committee) system center, which is not healthy."
As federal officials pursue a wide ranging investigation into the activities of Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff, his arrest on fraud charges in the purchase of a Florida casino boat company has increasingly focused attention on a little known congressman from rural Ohio.
Rep Robert W. Ney, R Ohio, placed comments in the Congressional Record favorable to Abramoff's 2000 purchase of the casino boat company, SunCruz Casinos.
Two years later, Ney sponsored legislation to reopen a casino for a Texas Indian tribe that Abramoff represented.
Ney approved a 2002 license for an Israeli telecommunications company to install antennas for the House.
The company later paid Abramoff $280000 for lobbying.
It also donated $50000 to a charity that Abramoff sometimes used to secretly pay for some of his lobbying activities.
Meanwhile, Ney accepted many favors from Abramoff, among them campaign contributions, dinners at the lobbyist's downtown restaurant, skybox fund raisers, including one at his MCI Center box here, and a golfing trip to Scotland in August 2002.
If statements made by Abramoff to tribal officials and in an e mail are to be believed, Ney sought the Scotland trip after he agreed to help Abramoff's Texas Indian clients.
Abramoff then arranged for his charity to pay for the trip, according to documents released by a Senate committee investigating the lobbyist.
Ney is under investigation by Florida federal prosecutors looking into Abramoff's acquisition of SunCruz, according to sources familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Abramoff and his business partner Adam Kidan were indicted in August on fraud charges related to the purchase.
Ney declined to be interviewed.
He has said his actions benefiting Abramoff had nothing to do with the favors he received.
He said he was misled by Abramoff and his associates.
"I am absolutely outraged by the dishonest and duplicitous words and actions of Jack Abramoff," Ney said last year when Abramoff's statements about Ney first came up in e mails released by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.
"As the testimony at both committee hearings has revealed, Jack Abramoff repeatedly lied to advance his own financial interests."
Abramoff, whose attorneys declined to comment for this article, has publicly denied that he misled Ney.
This spring, Ney hired a prominent Washington criminal defense lawyer, Mark Tuohey, to handle inquiries from the Justice Department and congressional investigators pursuing the widening scandal.
Tuohey has not returned phone calls in recent weeks to discuss his client.
A six term congressman from rural eastern Ohio, Ney, 51, does not have a national profile.
A former teacher and public safety director for his hometown of Bellaire, Ney was an Ohio legislator in 1994 when he defeated the Democratic incumbent in the congressional district once represented by Wayne Hays (D).
But to members of Congress, Ney is known as the mayor of Capitol Hill.
Ney is House Administration Committee chairman, a powerful position that doles out budgets, equipment, offices and parking spaces to House members.
These perks are used by House Republican leaders to keep their rank and file in line.
Ney became chairman of the committee thanks to his political patron, Rep Tom DeLay, R Texas, who recently stepped down as House majority leader after he was indicted on a charge of conspiracy to violate a Texas campaign law.
Shortly after Ney arrived in the House in 1994, he became a part of DeLay's Retain Our Majority Program (ROMP), a fund raising effort in which GOP colleagues donated to Republicans such as Ney in districts without a safe majority.
After lines were redrawn to make Ney's district more Republican, he returned the favor, donating to other vulnerable House Republicans.
That helped him earn his chairmanship in 2001, leapfrogging over a colleague with more seniority.
Ney and Abramoff, whom DeLay once described as "one of my closest and dearest friends," crossed paths as early as 1996.
That year Ney took a trip to Montenegro sponsored by a foundation that had links to Abramoff, who was a lobbyist for Montenegro.
A few years later, Ney paid some unusual attention to another Abramoff client, the Florida gambling boat company SunCruz, which was headquartered more than 1000 miles outside of Ney's congressional district.
Abramoff and his business partner were trying to buy the cruise ship fleet from Konstantinos "Gus" Boulis, but Boulis was demanding unwelcome additional terms.
In March 2000, Ney used the Congressional Record to assail Boulis.
"On the Ohio River we have gaming interests that run clean operations and provide quality entertainment," Ney wrote.
"I don't want to see the actions of one bad apple in Florida, or anywhere else to affect the business aspect of this industry or hurt any innocent casino patron in our country."
Ney's remarks were orchestrated by Michael Scanlon, a former DeLay spokesman who had just been hired to work for Abramoff at Preston Gates & Ellis LLP.
Scanlon had approached Ney through his chief of staff, Neil Volz, according to sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Volz has repeatedly declined to be interviewed.
A few months later, Boulis agreed in principle to sell SunCruz to Abramoff and Kidan for $147.5 million.
The deal closed in the fall.
But Abramoff and Kidan failed to make good on a $23 million payment owed to Boulis, court records show.
When Boulis was being difficult in the negotiations, Ney again made an official statement, this time heaping praise on Kidan.
"Since my previous statement, I have come to learn that SunCruz Casino now finds itself under new ownership and, more importantly, that its new owner has a renowned reputation for honesty and integrity," Ney said in the Congressional Record on Oct 26, 2000.
"The new owner, Mr Adam Kidan, is most well known for his successful enterprise, Dial a Mattress, but he is also well known as a solid individual and a respected member of his community.
"While Mr Kidan certainly has his hands full in his efforts to clean up SunCruz's reputation, his track record as a businessman and as a citizen lead me to believe that he will easily transform SunCruz from a questionable enterprise to an upstanding establishment that the gaming community can be proud of."
But Kidan's "track record" included a string of lawsuits, judgments, liens, bankruptcies and failed businesses.
His Dial a Mattress franchise in the District of Columbia was in bankruptcy.
He had filed personal bankruptcy, and he had surrendered his law license in New York after he was accused of fraud.
And one of his mentors, Anthony Moscatiello, was alleged by law enforcement to be an accountant for New York's Gambino crime family.
Ney later said he did not know about Kidan's background.
Four months after Ney's remarks in the Congressional Record, Boulis was murdered in Fort Lauderdale.
Police did not make any arrests in the case until September, when they charged four men in the slaying, including Moscatiello and a business associate of Moscatiello's whom Kidan had paid $250000 as catering consultants.
Five weeks after the Boulis killing, SunCruz officials, including Kidan, threw a $1000 a head fund raiser for Ney at Abramoff's skybox at the MCI Center, according to Abramoff's fund raising log.
In early 2002, Volz left his post as Ney's chief of staff to join Abramoff's lobbying team.
Soon after, in March 2002, Ney agreed to sponsor legislation that would benefit the Tigua tribe of El Paso, an Abramoff and Scanlon client.
They wanted Ney's help to reopen the Tiguas' casino, which the state of Texas had shut down.
"Just met with Ney!!!
We're f'ing gold!!!!
He's going to do Tigua," Abramoff told Scanlon in a March 20, 2002, e mail.
Six days later Abramoff directed tribal officials to make three contributions totaling $32000 to Ney's campaign and political action committees.
A Ney spokesman recently said that money has been donated to Ohio charities.
On June 7, 2002, Abramoff sent an e mail to Tigua consultant Marc Schwartz wrote that "our friend" had "asked if we could help (as in cover) a Scotland golf trip for him and some staff."
The e mail does not name "our friend," but Schwartz testified in the Senate last fall that it was Ney.
Abramoff, wrote that "the trip will be quite expensive (we did this for another member you know who) 2 years ago."
He was referring to an earlier Scotland golf trip that Abramoff had arranged in 2000 for DeLay.
Abramoff suggested to Schwartz that the tribe send $50000 to a charity he directed, the Capital Athletic Foundation, which would pay for the trip "as an educational mission."
Ney later stated on disclosure forms filed with the House that the August 2002 trip cost $3200 and was paid for by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative advocacy group on whose board Abramoff served.
The Washington Post reported last year that the trip was actually paid for by the Capital Athletic Foundation, which reported in tax records that it spent $150225 on the trip.
Ney has said he was misled by Abramoff about who paid for the trip.
"In April, 2002, I was approached by Mr Abramoff, who I believed to be a respected member of the community, and asked to go on a trip to Scotland which Mr Abramoff said would help support a charitable organization, that he founded, through meetings he organized with Scottish Parliament officials," Ney said in a statement last November.
Ney's report to Congress listed as a purpose of the trip: "speech to Scottish Parliamentarians."
However, there is no record of Ney's speech in the Scottish Parliament's register of official visits kept by the external liaison office, which is available on the Web.
In addition, at the time of Ney's trip, the Scottish Parliament was out for its August recess, spokeswoman Sally Coyne said.
Ney is not the first public official who has come under scrutiny by investigators for the Scotland trip.
David Safavian, then chief of staff at the General Services Administration, also went on the trip with Ney, Abramoff and former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed Jr. Safavian, who went on to become the chief White House procurement officer, was indicted this month on charges that he lied to investigators looking into the Scotland trip when he said that Abramoff had no business before the his agency.
The trip, Ney said in his statement last year, had nothing to do with legislation for the tribe.
"I want to be absolutely clear that at no point, ever, was I made even remotely aware that any Indian tribe played any role in this trip," Ney said in his statement.
Ney said he supported the Tigua legislation at Abramoff's request after the lobbyist told him the provision was supported by Sen Christopher J. Dodd, D Conn., who was sponsoring the election reform bill that would carry the Tigua provision.
"I then (in July 2002) personally asked Senator Dodd about this provision and he expressed no knowledge of it," Ney said.
"In short, I had been misled by Jack Abramoff.
I then asked Jack Abramoff why Senator Dodd was apparently not supporting it and Mr Abramoff told me that someone had lied to him.
The matter was then closed from my perspective."
However, the Tiguas say no one told them the matter was closed.
Tigua consultant Schwartz later testified to the Senate Indian Affairs Committee that Ney remained a strong supporter of the Tigua legislation and Abramoff long after his conversation with Dodd.
Schwartz said that in August 2002 a month after Ney's reported conversation with Dodd and around the time of the Scotland trip Abramoff arranged for Ney to meet with Tigua representatives in his office.
Before the meeting, "in an e mail to me, Abramoff mentioned that Congressman Ney didn't want his trip to Scotland brought up, as he would show his appreciation to the Tribe later," Schwartz testified.
The meeting lasted more than 90 minutes, two tribal members testified at the Senate hearing.
The tribal leaders who attended the meeting were pleased and impressed with the outcome, Schwartz said.
"During that meeting, Congressman Ney was very animated about Mr Abramoff's skill and repute as a leader in the lobbying circles," Schwartz testified.
"We were told about the impending success of Mr Abramoff's legislative plan and how much Congressman Ney wanted to help to restore the Tribe's ability to conduct gaming on their reservation."
Two months later, on Oct 8, after the election bill came out of a House Senate conference committee without a Tigua provision, Ney held a conference call with tribal officials and told them of his "disbelief that Dodd had gone back on his word" to support the provision, Schwartz testified.
Ney also expressed his continued support for the Tiguas, tribal officials said.
Ney responded to Schwartz's testimony by saying, "I, like these Indian tribes and other members of Congress, was duped by Jack Abramoff."
Ney later said he was very angry at Abramoff and Scanlon, who he said had misled him about Dodd.
Ney has called Abramoff and Scanlon's activities in the Tigua episode "nefarious."
Abramoff shot back by referring to the conference call when he spoke to the New York Times Magazine this spring.
"It's crazy" for Ney to say he was duped, Abramoff said.
"He was on the phone for an hour and a half!"
In the late 1990s, members of Congress became increasingly frustrated at the lack of cell phone coverage inside the Capitol and its nearby office buildings.
The House decided to let the major wireless companies select and pay for a company to install antennas for cellular phones.
In 1999, AT&T Wireless had asked LGC Wireless of San Jose to work with the House bureaucracy to put the antennas and repeaters into House buildings.
The project was one of the largest of its kind, worth more than $3 million.
At the time, LGC was the world's leading provider of such equipment and had wired the headquarters of most cellular phone companies, including Nextel and AT&T.
During the next year, LGC worked with the architect of the Capitol and the House Information Resources office to develop a plan.
Then Foxcom Wireless, an Israeli start up telecommunications firm, entered the picture.
Foxcom, which has since moved headquarters from Jerusalem to Vienna, Va., and been renamed MobileAccess Networks, lobbied for the job.
In early 2001, Ney took charge of the House Administration Committee, which was ultimately responsible for the antenna job.
Sometime that year, exactly when is unclear, Foxcom donated $50000 to the Capitol Athletic Foundation, Abramoff's charity.
Foxcom officials have declined to be interviewed about the donation or the wireless project.
A spokesman for Foxcom, now MobileAccess, referred all questions Monday to Ney's committee.
Also that same year, a decision was delayed on the antennas, which caught House staff by surprise.
"We were really surprised, given all the work we put in with LGC in designing the system," said Henry F. "Bud" Collins Jr., the senior network systems engineer for the House.
"Then, all of a sudden this other company showed up.
We had to go through this whole thing again."
LGC Chief Operating Officer Alex Gray wrote Ney to complain about the "highly politicized selection process" that favored the Israeli company despite the House's "Buy American" posture.
"Only Foxcom was permitted a full and fair hearing on the merits of its proposal essentially a 'back room' deal based on political expediency alone," Gray wrote.
Assistant House Counsel Carolyn Betz, replying on behalf of Ney, said in a letter to LGC that in the fall of 2001 the major wireless companies were receiving ballots to vote on who should get the contract.
In a letter to Betz, LGC president and chief executive Ian Sugarbroad called the election process "deeply flawed and unfair."
He said each wireless company was sent a ballot and allowed to vote for LGC, Foxcom or "no preference."
There were no details on the bid proposals, such as cost, security features, band capacity or critical performance metrics, Sugarbroad said.
Brian Walsh, Ney's spokesman, provided The Post redacted copies of the ballots.
Three show checkmarks in a box next to Foxcom.
The other three ballots are marked "no preference."
But representatives of all six companies said they voted no preference, according to interviews and documents.
Five of them were interviewed by The Post, and the sixth made its preference known in a letter obtained by The Post.
Spokesmen for the companies Cingular, Nextel, Sprint, Verizon Wireless, AT&T Wireless and Voicestream said they remained neutral because both LGC and Foxcom were considered capable of doing the job.
Walsh said those statements are "an absolute contradiction to the documentation."
Ney awarded the license to Foxcom on Nov 26, 2002, Walsh said.
He declined to make public a copy of documents relating to the agreement, noting that the Freedom of Information Act does not apply to Congress.
He noted that the work was paid for by the wireless companies and not by Congress, and he pointed out that the Senate also chose Foxcom.
LGC had no right to appeal.
"This is not a traditional House procurement and, thus, House procurement policies do not apply," Betz stated in her letter to LGC.
Collins, the House engineer who has since retired, said, "It almost seemed like the cards were stacked for them."
After the contract was awarded, Foxcom listed Abramoff as its lobbyist.
Over the next two years, Foxcom paid Abramoff's team $280000.

Two former high level U.S. Interior Department officials clashed before a Senate committee Wednesday over whether one of them while still in his government post sought to pressure Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton on behalf of controversial lobbyist Jack Abramoff's tribal clients.
J. Steven Griles, Interior's former deputy secretary, told the Senate Indian Affairs Committee that he had no special relationship with Abramoff and gave him no special access, as the lobbyist has claimed in e mails and at least one interview.
"That is outrageous ,and it is not true," Griles said.
But much of Griles' testimony was disputed by the man seated beside him at the witness table, former Interior Department counsel Michael Rosetti.
Griles' efforts to insinuate himself into Norton's decision making sessions on behalf of an Indian tribe Abramoff represented so worried him, Rosetti told senators, that he confronted the deputy secretary before two other officials and asked, "What was he doing?
Whose water was he carrying?"
The public dispute between the two offered a dramatic close to hearings that have explored the complex web of influence, money and access Abramoff wove as one of Washington most well connected lobbyists.
Abramoff has been indicted in federal court on six counts of fraud and conspiracy for his role in the 2000 purchase of a fleet of Florida gambling boats.
He has pleaded not guilty.
Wednesday's hearing focused on whether Abramoff, when working for the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana, relied on Griles to influence the Interior Department to block a rival tribe from opening a casino that would compete with the Coushattas' gaming business.
Rosetti recounted an incident in which, he said, Griles gave him a binder filled with letters and documents critical of the bid by the Jenna Band of the Choctaw Tribe to build a casino one hour from the Coushattas' $300 million a year casino.
Griles, Rosetti said, wanted him to make sure Norton saw the file.
Rosetti said he had to press Griles to learn that the folder had been compiled by Abramoff.
Griles denied that he said the binder came from Abramoff, and said he never knew who had put it on his desk.
He also denied published reports that he was pressuring Interior officials on Abramoff's behalf as he was negotiating with the lobbyist for a job.
Griles said he was surprised when Abramoff introduced him to a partner in Greenberg Traurig, the lobbying company Abramoff worked for, who offered him a job at the end of a brief meeting.
Griles said the offer "raised alarms with me," and he reported the incident to the Interior Department's ethics officer.
While in office, Griles had been investigated, but was never charged, with maintaining close ties to his previous employer, a lobbying company, and its clients.
A statement issued Wednesday by Abramoff's spokesman, Andrew Blum, described the lobbyist as having been put "into the impossible position of not being able to defend himself in the public arena until the proper authorities have had a chance to review all accusations."
In a statement issued Wednesday night, the Interior Department said that its inspector general is "reviewing all aspects of Mr Abramoff's contacts with the department both direct contacts and those which may have been conducted by surrogates."
That review, the statement said, "precludes further comment on these issues."
The statement noted that Sen John McCain, R Ariz., chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, said Wednesday there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Norton.
The statement added that "despite Mr Abramoff's efforts, the department ultimately issued a ruling contrary to the position he was advocating on behalf of his tribal client."
(Optional add end) The Abramoff investigation is one of several ethical headaches confronting the GOP that Democrats have charged add up to a culture of corruption in official Washington most recently the indictment of Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, in connection with the probe of the leak of a covert CIA officer's identity.
But Republican lawmakers have been watching the Abramoff scandal unfold in the media and before the Indian Affairs Committee with particular dread, because the lobbyist had extensive connections with party officials and because his relentless pursuit of profit documented in a string of e mails between Abramoff and his one time partner, Michael Scanlon, that the committee has released casts an unflattering light on the role of lobbyists.
Investigations into his activities have led to one indictment of a onetime government official, the former head of procurement for the General Services Administration, David Safavian, has been charged with making false statements and obstruction of justice in connection with a golf trip Abramoff took in 2002 with Rep Bob Ney, R Ohio, and others.
McCain's hearings have focused on Abramoff's dealings with six tribes.
According to McCain, the tribes paid Abramoff and Scanlon at least $66 million to advance gaming and other interests.
McCain's hearings and newspaper accounts have raised questions about trips Abramoff arranged for lawmakers, including Ney and Rep Tom DeLay, R Texas.
DeLay has asked the House ethics committee to look into his own travels and insists that he did nothing wrong.
The opening of the new Smithsonian museum honoring Native Americans has been a cause of joy and celebration in Washington.
But the good news has overshadowed emerging revelations about a sleazy political extortion scheme, allegedly launched by big shot Republican lobbyists, aimed at exploiting Indians.
Throughout U.S. history, "every kind of charlatan and every type of crook has deceived and exploited America's native sons and daughters," says Sen John McCain, R Ariz. "What sets this tale apart, what makes it truly extraordinary, is the extent and degree of the apparent exploitation and deceit."
The unfolding scandal touches some of the GOP's most influential elected officials and lobbyists, and could rock the capital before it's over.
To their credit, it is two independent minded Republicans McCain and Sen Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado who have exposed the sordid tale and are trying to clean up the mess.
At the center of the scandal is Jack Abramoff, a GOP lobbyist and longtime friend and political associate of some of his party's most gifted strategists, including Ralph Reed, the former head of the Christian Coalition and the Southern regional chairman for President Bush's re election campaign, and noted conservative activist Grover Norquist.
Abramoff is a leading GOP fund raiser, having collected hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years for House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas and other top Republicans.
He is also among the elite group of "Pioneers" who pledged to raise more than $100000 for Bush's re election campaign this year.
Abramoff was called before a hearing of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee last week, where he spent the morning invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination.
McCain, Campbell and other senators, wielding documents obtained via Senate subpoena, charged that Abramoff and public relations executive Michael Scanlon, a former aide to DeLay, have been running a crude political extortion racket that bilked tribes out of millions of dollars.
"All told, six tribes paid more than $66 million to Mr Scanlon, and Mr Abramoff received more than $21 million from Mr Scanlon for his share of the scheme," Campbell said.
"In at least two instances, Mr Abramoff and Mr Scanlon sought to profit by becoming involved in and attempting to manipulate tribal elections," said Campbell.
"Shortly after ,they solicited and received multimillion dollar contracts, aided by the tribal council members they helped elect."
The scheme was crude and crudely executed, according to the documents and testimony at the hearing.
Abramoff and Scanlon would allegedly work behind the scenes to scare Indian tribes into thinking that they were about to lose lucrative gaming franchises.
(Nice little casino you got there ,it would be a shame if anything happened to it.)
Then the two GOP insiders would step in and offer, for mighty fees, to smooth things over in Washington.
"Jack Abramoff, the tribes' trusted lobbyist and adviser, instructed the tribes to hire Michael Scanlon for millions of dollars," McCain charged.
"But he never disclosed that he would receive about half the net proceeds from the multimillion dollar contracts."
The lobbyists' e mails, obtained by the committee, show that Abramoff and Scanlon viewed their Native American clients with contempt, referring to them as "monkeys" and "troglodytes."
The scheme generated so much money that, aside from pocketing millions of dollars, the lobbyists funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republican candidates, and to the lobbyists' pals and pet causes.
"In the case of one tribe," said McCain, "the funds were allegedly paid from accounts reserved for tribal housing, education and health care.
That same tribe and another reportedly paid millions of dollars into ,a self proclaimed think tank run by two of Mr Scanlon's beach buddies, one a yoga instructor, the other a lifeguard."
Abramoff's high ranking place in the capital's conservative hierarchy, and reports of a federal criminal investigation, have raised the profile of this particular scandal beyond that of the routine influence peddling flap.
"Even in this town, where huge sums are routinely paid as the price of political access, the figures are astonishing," McCain said.

Campaign watchdog groups said Friday that it would be inappropriate for Rep Melissa A. Hart to oversee any potential inquiry of the House majority leader, Tom DeLay, because she had received $15000 from his political action committee and held a fund raiser at a restaurant owned by a Republican lobbyist at the center of a growing corruption scandal.
Hart, R Pa., had been named by the House ethics committee chairman to look into accusations about DeLay months ago, before the ethics panel became deadlocked earlier this year.
DeLay, of Texas, is under scrutiny for overseas trips organized by Jack Abramoff, the lobbyist, whose far reaching political work is now the subject of a federal grand jury investigation.
Campaign records filed with the Federal Election Commission show that Hart held a fund raising event at Abramoff's restaurant, Signatures, in Washington.
Phone calls placed Friday night to Hart's Capitol Hill office and a home listing in Pennsylvania were not returned.
After months of deadlock, Republicans and Democrats on the House Ethics Committee reached agreement this week on rules that are likely to lead to an investigation of DeLay, who was admonished three times by the committee last year.
Rep Doc Hastings, R Wash., who is the panel's chairman, had said earlier this month that he intended to appoint Hart to oversee any review of the charges against the House leader.
Since Republicans agreed earlier this week to rescind rules that had made it more difficult to open an ethics investigation, Hastings has not said whether Hart would still direct any review.
"Her conclusions are automatically suspect because she has her own potential ethics issues come into play," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington, which alerted news organizations to campaign records showing that Hart had spent $1587 on a fund raiser at Abramoff's restaurant.
The campaign records showed the event at Abramoff's restaurant was held on Sept 24, 2003, and that the payments went toward "catering costs."
Numerous other House Republicans have held events at the same restaurant.
Other previously disclosed campaign records show that between 1999 and 2001, Hart, from the 4th District of Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh, received $15000 from the political committee run by DeLay, the Americans for a Republican Majority.
On Friday, an editorial in The Pittsburgh Post Gazette praised Hart for "her willingness to take on party leaders in her earlier service in the state Legislature."
"But her dogged party loyalty could cloud the independence she needs to follow the facts" in the investigation of DeLay, the editorial said.
"She also needs to overcome the reality that she accepted $15000 from one of Mr DeLay's political action committees."
A group of congressional figures has joined House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R Texas, under an ethics cloud stemming from foreign golf junkets arranged by a lobbyist facing influence peddling investigations.
DeLay landed in trouble last month over a 2000 trip to Scotland with the lobbyist.
But two additional congressmen and three House aides also played St. Andrews on separate junkets with the lobbyist that might have violated House rules, records show.
And, like the Texas Republican, all omitted disclosing the key role of embattled lobbyist Jack Abramoff.
He privately raised tens of thousands of dollars for private jets and boasted of setting up golf junkets, according to documents, congressional testimony and interviews.
One of Abramoff's golf guests was Rep Robert W. Ney, R Ohio, chairman of the powerful House Administration Committee.
He said in congressional filings that his trip on a chartered jet in 2002 was sponsored and paid by an obscure conservative think tank, the National Center for Public Policy Research.
But the center's president told the Los Angeles Times that it "did not sponsor, nor did we pay" for Ney's travels.
The same nonprofit organization also was listed by then freshman Rep Tom Feeney, R Fla., after he flew to Scotland with the lobbyist in August 2003.
But in response to inquiries by the Times, the center said it did not provide "a single dime" for the Feeney junket.
Congressmen routinely travel as guests of educational and policy groups, but they cannot accept trips and gifts from lobbyists.
The National Center's contradictions of the congressmen's reports raise questions about whether Ney and Feeney violated House rules and filed false documents to disguise gifts from a lobbyist.
It is the latest twist in a mounting ethics scandal swirling around one of Washington's most prominent lobbyists.
Ney and Feeney, through spokesmen, blamed others for any filing errors.
"It was the Congressman's understanding that this trip was permissible under House rules," said Brian J. Walsh, communications director for Ney.
He said it was "based on representations" by Abramoff that the National Center sponsored their travel.
A spokesman for Feeney expressed surprise.
"You are the first to inform me of the information being incorrect," said Jason Roe, chief of staff for the Florida congressman.
He said any false information would be "the result of someone misleading (the congressman), not any nefarious activity on his part."
In a statement last week, the Center said it paid for DeLay, his wife, Christine, and others to visit London and meet with British political leaders.
There was no mention of the golf excursions that, according to documents and Senate testimony, were arranged by Abramoff.
Abramoff, among the most powerful Republican lobbyists on Capitol Hill over the last decade, is the focus of inquiries by a federal grand jury and a U.S. Senate committee.
The criminal investigation appears to be a sweeping probe of Abramoff's lobby practice, based on interviews with witnesses and published accounts.
The Senate Indian Affairs Committee is looking into allegations Abramoff and a former DeLay aide bilked six Indian tribes out of millions of dollars in lobbying and public relations fees.
Department of Justice and Indian Affairs Committee officials declined to discuss their investigations.
At the time of his Scotland trip in 2002, Ney of Ohio was attempting to amend a bill to aid an Abramoff tribal client in Texas.
Ney came to Abramoff's aid two years earlier on another case.
He took the House floor to publicly castigate the owner of a Florida based gambling cruise ship company that Abramoff was trying to buy.
And before his 2000 golf trip, DeLay helped beat back efforts to end use of low wage workers in Pacific island sweatshops, blocking legislation strongly opposed by Abramoff's clients.
Early details of Abramoff's role in the golf junkets emerged during a Senate hearing in November.
A consultant to one tribal client of Abramoff testified that the lobbyist told him he needed $100000 to pay for Ney and his contingent's golf trip to Scotland.
Abramoff also told the consultant that he had arranged a similar golf trip for DeLay in 2000, according to the testimony.
Abramoff paid $72000 from a personal business account to charter a jet in advance of the Ney trip, records released by a Senate committee show.
Since the scandal broke last fall, Ney has tried to distance himself from Abramoff.
In a written statement Nov 17, Ney expressed shock and disgust at the "duplicitous, immoral and possibly criminal behavior (of the lobbyist)."
Previously, Feeney had not been tied to the Abramoff controversy.
Also facing possible ethics questions for the first time are three House staffers who accompanied the congressmen on golf trips.
Like House members, staff aides are required to file reports on trips sponsored by outside parties and may not accept travel financed or arranged by lobbyists.
They are responsible for knowing and accurately reporting who pays for their expenses, according to House rules.
Abramoff did not respond to questions for this story.
A spokesman for his attorney, Abbe Lowell, issued a brief response.
He said the lobbyist had been the victim of "unfair attacks" and that "Mr Abramoff can only hope that people will not rush to judgment based on negative and one sided attacks."
(Optional add end) Jack Abramoff rode a Republican wave into Washington, D.C., in 1994.
Within weeks of midterm elections that gave the GOP control of the House, he left Hollywood and swapped his movie producer role to be a Capitol Hill lobbyist.
He was politically conservative, a former president of the College Republicans, and had close ties with the new congressional leadership, including DeLay.
His clients ranged from Pacific island territories to wealthy Indian tribes.
Trouble arose when some of his clients began to question the fees.
Tribal leaders told Senate and federal investigators that Abramoff pressured them to pay millions of dollars in fees to former DeLay aide, Michael Scanlon.
Senate investigators discovered that the fees secretly were shared with Abramoff.
Both Abramoff, 46, and Scanlon, 34, took the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer questions before the Senate in the fall.
One of their former tribal clients has since filed a lawsuit alleging civil fraud.
Controversy surrounding some of the lobbyist fees was first disclosed in a small newspaper in Louisiana, the Daily Town Talk of Alexandria, in 2003.
It drew national attention after reports last year in the Washington Post.
Senators, in a series of hearings last fall, criticized the two lobbyists for ripping off the tribes by collecting about $66 million in fees.
Abramoff pocketed $21 million.
Those payments were described as "exorbitant" by a member of the Senate panel, and they did not include lucrative lobbying fees paid to Abramoff's Washington law office, the Miami based firm Greenberg Traurig.
Abramoff also pressed his clients to make what Sen John McCain, R Ariz., called "substantial political and dubious charitable contributions."
McCain, now chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, said those payments warrant additional investigation.
A November hearing focused on Scanlon and Abramoff splitting $4.2 million in fees to help the Tiguas, a Texas tribe hard hit when the state closed their casino.
Senators accused Abramoff and Scanlon of working both sides of the case secretly helping Christian conservative Ralph Reed persuade Texas state officials to close the Indian gambling center, then charging the Tigua tribe hefty fees to lobby for legislation to reopen it.
Sarah Few, a spokeswoman, said Reed worked against the casino because he was opposed to gambling.
He had nothing to do with later efforts to reopen it, Few said.
Scanlon did not respond to requests for comment.
As chairman of the House Administration Committee, Ney was in a position to help the Tigua tribe.
Abramoff told tribal leaders that the Ohio congressman could attach language concerning their shuttered casino to an unrelated election reform bill.
Ney was the bill's author and as committee chairman would be part of the House Senate conference committee determining its final language.
Six days after Abramoff said Ney agreed, the lobbyist asked the tribe to send three checks to the congressman's political committees.
Checks totaling $32000 were sent.Two months later, Abramoff asked the Tiguas to pay half of Ney's golf junket to Scotland.
Another tribal client would pay the rest, he said.
Marc Schwartz, a governmental affairs consultant for the Tiguas, told the Senate he "received an e mail from Abramoff" suggesting the tribe's share would be $50000.
He asked them to send it by Federal Express.
The tribe did not want to pay.
At Abramoff's direction, they had hired and paid Scanlon $4.2 million and made campaign contributions of $300000 to Ney and others.
Instead, the Tiguas arranged for their share of junket expenses to come from the Alabama Coushatta, the other Texas tribe that would benefit from special language proposed for the pending legislation, according to testimony and interviews.
Following Abramoff's instructions, the Alabama Coushatta tribe, through its casino, made out a check for $50000 payable to a foundation controlled by the lobbyist.
It was recorded as a charitable contribution to the Capital Athletic Foundation, according to tax records.
Corporate records list Abramoff and his wife, Pamela, as the foundation's sole directors.
In August 2002, Ney and his party flew in a chartered jet to St. Andrews' fabled golf course with Abramoff.
Others making the trip included Scanlon, conservative Reed, David Safavian, a General Services Administration official, and Ney's chief of staff, William Heaton, according to records and testimony.
Heaton reported to the House that his trip had been sponsored by the National Center.
Safavian and Reed said they paid their own way.
Safavian, who has since been appointed chief of procurement at the Office of Management and Budget by President Bush, said he wrote a personal check to Abramoff.
Ney's travel report naming the National Center as sponsor omitted any reference to golf.
The purpose, Ney said, was to make a "speech to Scottish parliamentarians, attend Edinburgh Military Tattoo" and visit the British Parliament.
On his return, Ney met with tribal leaders in his congressional office where he sang the praises of Abramoff, according to Senate testimony by Tigua officials.
He pledged to help get their casino reopened, they said.
But Sen Christopher J. Dodd, D Conn., author of the Senate version of the election reform bill, refused to add special language to the bill.
The Tigua casino never reopened.
"My heart goes out to the Indian tribes ,who were duped," Ney said in his November statement.
He blamed the lobbyist.
"I too was misled," he said, by Abramoff and Scanlon whom he called "these two nefarious individuals."
Ney said he was not "even remotely aware that any Indian tribe played any role (in his trip to Scotland)."
It was adirect and unambiguous denial.
"The National Center for Public Policy Research did not sponsor, nor did we pay for, a 2002 trip reportedly taken by Rep Ney and others," said Amy Ridenour, center president.
"We were not even aware that such a trip had taken place," she wrote in response to a reporter's questions.
The Center describes itself as "a communications and research foundation supportive of a strong national defense and dedicated to providing free market solutions to today's public policy problems."
Formed in 1982, it has an annual revenue of more than $6 million.Ridenour leads the center and her husband David is vice president Tax returns for the organization show the couple was paid a combined $275000 in 2003.
After the November elections Ridenour wrote opinion pieces sent to newspapers nationwide that urged Bush to address Social Security reform and to reduce government regulation.
The center has issued several reports on environmental issues and charges that environmentalists have engaged in "a jihad against corporate America."
It gets most of its revenue through direct mail solicitations, records show, and boasts of receiving no public funding.
Abramoff was on its board of directors from 1995 to 2004 and some of his tribal clients were among its major backers.
The Choctaw tribe of Mississippi gave $1 million to the center, according to Senate testimony.
The Louisiana Coushattas, according to a spokesman, were asked to donate more than $1 million but never made the payment.
Tax records show that the center, in turn, supports Abramoff.
It paid an Abramoff controlled company $1.2 million for consulting and made separate donations of $450000 and $250000 to the athletic foundation established and controlled by the lobbyist and his wife.
A year after the Ney trip, Abramoff was headed back to Scotland on a chartered jet with Rep Feeney.
And like Ney, Feeney reported that the National Center was the sponsor of the August 2003 trip, picking up a tab of $5643.
In addition to playing golf "on two, possibly three occasions," according to a Feeney aide, the Florida congressman met with Scottish business and political leaders.
Also on the trip with Feeney were Reed and two congressional aides Mark Zachares and Bob R. Brooks Jr.
Both aides listed the National Center as their trip sponsor, although the nonprofit agency also flatly disputed that.
The aides filed their travel disclosure reports with the House clerk's office hours after receiving e mails from Abramoff's Washington law office that advised them and Feeney what to report.
In those e mails, Abramoff's office listed the National Center as the sponsor and provided figures for the costs of transportation, lodging and meals.
The aides used those figures on their filings to the clerk's office, documents show.
Zachares, now a top staffer on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, once served as a labor and immigration official in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory.
Abramoff represented the territory and its apparel manufacturers at the time.
Brooks is chief of staff to Rep Jim McCrery, R La., who was then fighting attempts of the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians to open a casino in his Louisiana district.
The lobbyist also opposed the proposed gaming facility because it would have competed with a client's casino.
Neither Brooks nor Zachares responded to questions from The Times.
The National Center, in acknowledging its sponsorship of the DeLay trip in 2000, made no mention of golfing in Scotland.
Its statement noted the trip involved "significant policy meetings" including a visit with former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher.
"We were then and remain honored that they chose to accept our invitation," the statement reads, calling the trip "consistent with our mission as an educational foundation."
The trip cost $70000 for DeLay and his entourage, records show.
DeLay, known as "The Hammer" when he became Republican whip a decade ago, also was a guest of the center in 1997 for a trip to Russia.
The National Journal reported in February that Abramoff sought reimbursement from his then law firm for $13318 in hotel bills incurred on the 2000 trip, including $4285 for DeLay and his wife, Christine, to stay at a London hotel.
Payment of DeLay's hotel bill by lobbyist Abramoff would be prohibited by House ethics rules.
Abramoff bragged of setting up the Scottish golf trip for his friend DeLay, according to Senate testimony and e mails.
In a June 7, 2002, e mail to Tigua consultant Schwartz, Abramoff wrote of the upcoming Ney golf junket, saying it "will be quite expensive (We did this for another member you know who) two years ago."
Abramoff identified "you know who" as Tom DeLay, Schwartz testified.
DeLay bristled when asked last week about the Britain trip, saying he reported it properly.He brushed aside questions about the lobbyist, saying that "Jack Abramoff is not the only person I talk to in Washington, D.C.
I have a lot of relationships, hundreds of relationships."
Records show their relationship has benefited Abramoff over the years.
In one case, DeLay helped stop a Republican proposal to tax Indian casino proceeds.
Abramoff's clients were among the leading opponents of that tax.
Since the golf trip, DeLay has continued to help Abramoff's clients.
In 2003, he joined the House speaker and other Republican leaders signing a letter to U.S. Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton.
The group opposed a new casino in Louisiana that would have competed with another club run by one of Abramoff's biggest clients.
Times researcher Mark Madden contributed to this report.
LOUISIANA TRIBAL OFFICIALS TRYING TO PROTECT CASINO INTERESTS TESTIFY TO SENATE COMMITTEE THAT ACCUSED FORMER LOBBYISTS BETRAYED THEM WASHINGTON Leaders of the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana on Wednesday accused two former lobbyists of scaring them into paying exorbitant fees by suggesting that Texas would legalize gambling, hurting their casino's attraction to patrons from the Houston area.
The tribal officials testified before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, which is investigating the lobbying activities of Jack Abramoff and Michael Scanlon, a former spokesman for Rep Tom DeLay, R Texas.
The two are accused of diverting millions of dollars from Indian tribes for personal use.
The Coushattas, who paid Abramoff and Scanlon $36 million in fees over three years, told the panel they feel betrayed by the lobbyists.
"While Indian country has seen many con men through history, few were as skilled as Mr Abramoff and Mr Scanlon at creating and preying upon insecurities,"said Kevin Stickey, chairman of the Coushatta tribe, which runs the casino resort near Kinder, La.
"They exaggerated political threats, and they exaggerated economic threats."
Scanlon and Abramoff, who once boasted of a close working relationship with DeLay, have denied wrongdoing.
Coushatta officials said that in 2001 they paid Scanlon's company, Capital Campaign Strategies, $870000 to set up a grass roots political organization in Texas to lobby against gambling.
They said Scanlon had written them that "with the Enron and Continental Airlines debacles hitting the Houston area, they are desperate for revenue,We have never before seen such a pro gaming atmosphere in Texas."
Enron filed for bankruptcy amid financial scandal and the airline was hurt by a drop in travel after the Sept 11, 2001, attacks.
The Texas Legislature was considering, but never approved, gambling.
The Coushatta paid the firm run by former Christian Coalition director Ralph Reed to drum up opposition to gambling among ministers and other social conservatives in Texas.
According to tribal officials, the Coushatta funneled $400000 in funds through third parties, who then paid Reed.
The lobbyists also worked against the tribe's interest, according to a Senate investigation that uncovered an e mail from Abramoff to an associate in which he suggested trying to obtain the business of the Alabama Coushatta, who wanted to open a rival casino in Texas.
Scanlon charged the Coushatta of Louisiana $1.3 million to set up a data base and then paid $104000 to another firm to construct the computer file.
Sen John McCain, R Ariz, chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, said Scanlon's accounting records showed that he also skimmed $115000 from the Indian fees to pay for his wedding, which ultimately never took place.
He diverted $1.4 million to pay for work on his house and personal expenses, the committee found.
The committee heard conflicting testimony about whether Abramoff persuaded former Deputy Secretary of the Interior, Steven Griles, to intervene on behalf of the Coushattas to prevent the competing Jenna Choctaws tribe from opening a casino in Louisiana.
Griles told the committee he had not participated in the case.
But Michael Rosetti, former counsel to Interior Secretary Gale Norton, told the senators he repeatedly had to rebuff Griles' efforts to intervene.
Griles acknowledged meeting with Abramoff several times.
McCain said he hoped to introduce legislation next week to address some of the abuses.
Abramoff and Scanlon are also being investigated by the Justice Department.
And Abramoff has been indicted in Florida in a separate case involving his ownership of a cruise ship company.
The government of a U.S. territory in the Pacific said Thursday that it had been unable to determine what work was performed for a $1.2 million contract awarded to a close associate of a Washington lobbyist at the center of a growing corruption scandal here.
The no bid contract to promote "ethics in government" was awarded in 1996 to David Lapin, a rabbi whom the lobbyist, Jack Abramoff, later hired to run a now defunct private Jewish school in the Washington suburbs.
The contract was one of several totaling about $9 million given to Abramoff and his associates that have provoked questions about the lobbyist's activities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
Those activities included a 1998 trip arranged for Tom DeLay, the House majority leader, who is facing ethical questions about his relationship with Abramoff.
Democrats in Congress have also said that two of DeLay's former staff members improperly influenced island elections in part to assure that Abramoff continued to win contracts there.
Lapin's brother, Daniel, a Seattle rabbi who has long promoted conservative causes in Washington, introduced DeLay and Abramoff, according to the lobbyist, shortly before the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994.
In audits in late 2001, the Marianas government said that it had overpaid for eight years of lobbying contracts with Abramoff, that he had been paid without a contract in some cases and that it had been difficult to justify his hiring based on what work he did.
The investigations of Abramoff in Congress and by a federal grand jury in Washington have looked into allegations of fraud in his dealings with American Indian tribes, but two weeks ago, the ranking Democrat on the congressional committee that oversees the islands demanded that the investigation be expanded to include his work in the Northern Marianas.
The islands, an American commonwealth with a large garment industry that employs mostly Chinese laborers, hired Abramoff in 1994 to help its government fend off legislation imposing American standards on wage and working conditions.
The contract was awarded by the then governor, Froilan Tenorio, under fire from the Clinton administration for what it labeled the islands' exploitative labor practices.
The audit, conducted after Tenorio left office, found that the islands had paid $9.5 million to lobbyists, most of it, $6.7 million, to Preston Gates & Ellis, the lobbying firm where Abramoff worked at the time, and $500000 to the firm Greenberg Traurig for eight months in 2001 after Abramoff moved there.
In addition, Abramoff had lobbying contracts with the textile industry trade group there.
Supportive columnists with The Saipan Tribune, owned by the owner of the largest garment concern in the territory, have said he is a star in Washington because of his prowess in deflecting congressional efforts to tighten labor laws.
Abramoff's biggest year, according to the audit, was 1997, when Preston Gates earned $3.1 million from the territory.
Around that time, the territories hired David Lapin.
The Lapin brothers are from South Africa and met Abramoff on one of his trips there.
Abramoff later helped Daniel Lapin found Toward Tradition, a Seattle group that describes itself as working "against anti religion bigotry," and remains a board member.
In a 2002 interview with The New York Times, Abramoff said he first met DeLay through Daniel Lapin, who would meet frequently with members of Congress to press conservative causes.
Pam Brown, the attorney general for the Marianas, said Thursday that the government had been unable to determine what work David Lapin had done.
"We haven't been able to figure out what the deliverables were," she said.
"He was tasked with providing some sort of ethical parameters for government work.
That's all I know at this point.
We're more amazed at the cost."
A woman answering the phone at Strategic Business Ethics in California, where Lapin is chief executive, said he could not be reached for comment because of the Passover holidays.
DeLay, whose foreign travel arranged by lobbyists has drawn criticism in Congress for possible ethical violations, visited the Marianas in 1998 with his wife and daughter and three aides.
Upon his return, he declared dead a bill that Democrats had hoped to pass raising wages and controlling immigration in the Marianas.
In 1999, DeLay's former chief of staff, Edwin Buckham, and his former spokesman, Michael Scanlon, both of whom later worked with Abramoff in his lobbying firm, visited the islands to persuade two local lawmakers to change their votes for speaker of the islands' House of Representatives.
The DeLay associates wanted the two legislators to support the candidate of the garment industry, Ben Fitial, who was close to Abramoff, and promised that federal contracts to the islands would follow if they did.
Buckham later represented Enron in its bid to build an energy plant in the Northern Marianas, and when Enron lost to a Japanese concern, DeLay worked to get the bidding reopened.
"For years, Mr Abramoff lobbied to protect a Marianas industry that exploited tens of thousands of women workers, many of whom were channeled into the island sex trade," said Rep George Miller, D Calif, who called for the investigation of Abramoff's work in the Marianas.
He noted the audits and added that newspapers on the islands had reported this week that Fitial admitted he had won the speakership because of the work by DeLay's associates.
"Given the evidence in the public reports, it's long past time for Congress to investigate allegations of undue influence and corruption," Miller said.
Two former top aides of House Majority Leader Tom DeLay brokered a political deal here five years ago that helped land island government contracts worth $1.6 million for a Washington lobbyist now the target of a federal corruption probe.
Using promises of U.S. tax dollars as bartering chips, Edwin Buckham and Michael Scanlon traveled to these remote Pacific islands in late 1999 to convince two local legislators to switch their votes for speaker of the 18 member House of Representatives in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
They succeeded.
Once in office, the new speaker pressed the island's governor to re instate an expired lobbying pact with Jack Abramoff, now under grand jury and congressional investigation.
Within months of the visit, Abramoff's law firm had a contract paying $100000 a month from the Marianas government.
Also, the island districts of the legislators who switched sides soon won federal budget benefits from Congress, apparently supported by DeLay.
Details of the overseas mission and the trade of political favors nearly half the globe from Capitol Hill, come from interviews, government documents and e mails reviewed by the Los Angeles Times.
The latest disclosures coming out of the Pacific islands add fuel to the yearlong political scandal swirling around Abramoff and his ties to congressional leaders, especially DeLay.
The Republican majority leader lately has sought to distance himself from the besieged lobbyist he once called a close friend.
DeLay has been stung by charges that Abramoff paid some of the congressman's expenses on foreign travel, including a golf junket to Scotland, in potential violation of House ethics rules.
DeLay said he thought expenses were properly paid by a think tank.
Abramoff's prominent lobbying career crashed last year after the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs accused him and Scanlon of ripping off six Indian tribes who had paid them $66 million.
Both men took the Fifth Amendment at the hearings.
A federal grand jury is now investigating.
"This is starting to smell more like criminal activity trading congressional appropriations for votes," said U.S.
Rep George Miller, D Calif. A longtime critic of Abramoff and DeLay's activities in the Pacific island territories, Miller renewed his recent call for an investigation of Abramoff by the House Resources Committee that oversees the region.
DeLay declined to respond to a series of detailed questions for this report but his spokesman issued a statement defending the congressman's actions that he said were aimed at improving the standard of living for U.S. citizens living in the territory.
In December 1999, when they traveled to Saipan, Scanlon was in his last days as communications director for DeLay and also was listed as a staff aide to DeLay on the House Appropriations Committee.
A spokesman for DeLay said Scanlon was on unpaid leave at the time of the trip, but records show he did not leave the payroll until January 2000.
Buckham, a former chief of staff for the Texas Republican, had opened his own lobbying company, Alexander Strategy Group.
At the time, his company collected fees from DeLay's main political fund and then paid a salary to DeLay's wife, Christine, for her work for the fund.
Buckham declined to respond to detailed questions.
Scanlon's lawyer did not respond to similar questions.
A spokesman for Abramoff also declined to answer questions.
The Mariana Islands, a self governing U.S. territory subject to acts of Congress, have proven to be a veritable treasure chest for Abramoff.
His lobbying successes have been closely linked to his relationship with DeLay.
Since 1995, Abramoff and two law firms where he was a partner collected more than $7.7 million from the commonwealth government, records show.
He lobbied to keep Washington from cracking down on the island's garment industry where workers are paid $3.05 an hour, well below the federal minimum wage of $5.15, to work in what critics say are substandard sweatshop conditions.
The workers, many brought in from China under less restrictive immigration rules than in the rest of the United States and most of its territories, produce garments that are still stamped "Made in USA," thanks, in part, to the efforts of Abramoff and DeLay.
DeLay helped lead the fight beginning in 1997 to keep Congress from enacting reforms opposed by Abramoff and his clients that would have required garment manufacturers to pay their workers the higher federal minimum wage.
"Make no mistake about it, passage of that bill would kill jobs, growth and opportunity," DeLay said in a statement he put in the Congressional Record in 1997.
In a June 1997 letter to the Marianas governor , DeLay, then the majority whip, and Majority Leader Dick Armey promised to block any legislation to increase federal regulation on garment manufacturers, according to published accounts.
Three years later a bill that would have barred the use of "Made in USA" by the island's apparel industry was never even brought up for a House vote though it had 234 co sponsors, more than a majority.
DeLay traveled to Saipan, the Marianas capital,, with his family in 1998 on a trip arranged by Abramoff, who billed the island government for the time his firm spent setting up the trip, records show.
Abramoff told island officials that DeLay is "our biggest supporter on Capitol Hill."
In a statement issued this week a Delay spokesman said the legislation that the majority leader opposed "would have strangled the (Marianas') burgeoning economy."
He also cited the island government's commitment "to implement free market reforms that would dramatically increase employment opportunities and living standards."
Despite his success, however, Abramoff's lobbying arrangement with the Northern Marianas government ended in late 1998, according to official lobbying reports, because of a change in administrations and commonwealth fiscal problems.
His government work had been suspended for more than a year when DeLay's former aides came to the islands before Christmas 1999.
One of Abramoff's strong local allies and supporters was Benigno Fitial, an underdog contender for speaker of the House.
The speakership vote was set for early 2000.
In an interview, Fitial called Buckham a longtime friend and said the former DeLay chief of staff offered to help and bring along Scanlon.
"They supported me and wanted me to be speaker," Fitial said.
Fitial said he met with the Washington visitors after they arrived, and targeted two key members of the Legislature for persuasion efforts Alejo Mendiola and Norman Palacios.
Both said in separate interviews that Buckham and Scanlon promised to help get money for needed projects in their impoverished island districts.
For Palacios, it was assistance repairing a dilapidated, half century old breakwater on the island of Tinian.
Palacios agreed to switch and backed Fitial.
"They said they would lobby for money for the breakwater," he said of his meeting with Scanlon and Buckham.
Asked why he, a longtime Democrat would switch support to Fitial, the head of the rival Covenant Party, Palacios said, "That's politics."
In October 2000, Congress passed a federal appropriations bill for energy and water that included $150000 for the first steps in the breakwater restoration project.
DeLay, then a member of the House Appropriations Committee, was on the conference committee approving the allocation.
Mendiola, who no longer serves in the CNMI House, said he was promised federal assistance but denied any specific project was mentioned.
Island records show efforts were under way to provide federal funding for an airport repaving project on Rota, the island Mendiola represented.
In May 2000, the Rota runway resurfacing project was among the airport projects that the House Appropriations Committee directed should be given priority for discretionary grants in the Federal Aviation Administration budget for 2001, according to the committee report on the bill.
DeLay also was a member of the transportation subcommittee that prepared the report.
Palacios and Mendiola said they were well aware of Scanlon's and Buckham's ties to DeLay.
"They worked for him," Mendiola said.
Fitial denied the federal budget benefits were tied to his speakership vote.
"No!
No!
No!
There was no I give you something, you give me something," Fitial said.
Following the visit of Buckham and Scanlon, Fitial took several steps to pressure the island government to renew and extend contracts with Abramoff's law firm.
He sent e mails to top government officials warning of dire consequences if Abramoff was not awarded a new contract.
In an e mail to a top aide of then Gov. Pedro P. Tenorio on June 30, 2000, Fitial wrote: "Please urge Teno to execute the agreement as we will continue to encounter problems ,if the contract is not executed.
We need P & G (Abramoff's law firm) to help save our economy,Please help!!"
The Fitial led House also passed two resolutions urging the governor to hire a lobbyist, including a July 26, 2000, resolution calling for selection of Abramoff's firm.
A few days later, Tenorio relented and hired the firm for $100000 a month.
In 2001, Fitial went to bat again for Abramoff, pressing to assure that the lobbyist's contracts were extended.
He supported a resolution saying that the Sept 11 terrorist attacks "have created an urgent need for the continued services" of Abramoff's firm.
Palacios was a sponsor of that resolution.
Abramoff's billing records, recently made public by the Marianas government, show how the lobbyist used the islands to woo Washington friends and then used those Washington friends to woo his island clients.
For example, the lobbyist and his law firm routinely arranged for congressional junkets to the islands, despite ethics rules barring such practices.
Travel costs often were advanced by the firm or charged to Abramoff's personal credit card, including expenses for as much as $67466, records showed.
He expressed concern for ethics rules in one e mail urging Mariana officials to speed reimbursement of thousands of dollars to his firm.
Abramoff warned that the House ethics committee was asking questions.
The billing records also provide a rare glimpse behind the scenes of Abramoff's self promotion to impress his lobbying clients.
In one 2001 memo, Abramoff bragged to Marianas officials about an unnamed top U.S. Department of Justice official who was the lobbyist's guest at his box seat for a Washington Redskin game.
Abramoff said the official tipped him off about a secret internal document that might jeopardize CNMI's cherished immigration exemptions.
He said there was concern in some quarters that island immigration rules, favoring the garment industry, could be exploited by terrorists.
"They (Department of Justice officials) have been spending a week or so telling everyone who will listen that the CNMI, if it is not taken over, will be a major entry point for terrorists.
This, of course, is patently ridiculous," Abramoff wrote on Oct 1, 2001.
The lobbyist turned that threat into an opportunity to demonstrate his potential value, saying he could help thwart such efforts and would be seeing the attorney general in a week.
"It will require some major action from the Hill and a press attack to get this back in the bottle," Abramoff wrote.
The Abramoff memo prompted denials from current and former Justice Department officials.
David Ayres, who was chief of staff to then Attorney General John Ashcroft, acknowledged attending the Redskins game "at the invitation of two longtime friends and former colleagues" but denied there was any conversation about a classified memo.
He said "a review of Justice Department records indicates that Mr Abramoff never met with the attorney general or me during our services there."
Justice Department spokesman Mark Corallo said that Ashcroft never met with Abramoff and attributed the references in the memo to "a lot of bluster to impress a client."
The Oct 1, 2001, memo was written as Abramoff's final contract with the islands was winding down.
He warned that the territory was in jeopardy.
"I wish the situation was not as critical as it is, but unfortunately our enemies have not gone away, just been beaten back," he concluded.
In a Jan 4, 2001 letter seeking a renewal of his contract, Abramoff bragged of bringing the territory "back from the brink of disaster,It also allowed us to acquire some very powerful allies such as (then) Majority Whip Tom DeLay."
At one time, when his pitch for a renewed contract in 2001 appeared to be failing, Abramoff sent yet another e mail warning to island officials complaining that he was in trouble with his law partners for providing services without getting paid.
"They were not pleased that the work we did in January has to be written off and feel we might be in violation of the LDA (Lobbyist Disclosure Act).
Need you guys to get me this contract ASAP," Abramoff wrote Feb 5, 2001.
Although the contract was renewed shortly after that e mail, the reprieve was temporary.
Abramoff lost his CNMI contract in early 2002 when Juan Babauta took office as governor, having beaten several candidates including Fitial, the candidate of Abramoff and DeLay.
Abramoff donated $5000 to Fitial's campaign, records show.
Despite congressional defeat of the wage and immigration legislation fought by Abramoff, the Marianas apparel industry has suffered another setback with elimination of tariffs on Chinese made goods.
Several Saipan factories have closed and moved to China where labor costs are even less expensive.
But Fitial, still in the speaker post that DeLay's aides helped him win, has not given up.
He wants Congress to make it easier for island garment manufacturers to satisfy requirements for claiming it was "Made in USA" reducing the locally produced content from 50 percent to only 30 percent.
"We don't have Jack (Abramoff)," Fitial said, blaming what he called unfair attacks on the lobbyist.
"We need the help of the U.S. Congress.
Tom DeLay, he's the one who can help us," Fitial said.

In a widening scandal affecting Congress, the U.S. government charged a partner of a major Republican lobbyist with defrauding Indian tribes of millions of dollars in a scheme that lavished golf trips, meals and campaign donations on a member of Congress.
Michael Scanlon, an ex aide to former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, is headed for federal court Monday on a conspiracy count contained in a criminal information.
This typically is a prelude to a guilty plea and full cooperation with government investigators.
DeLay, until recently one of the most powerful politicians in the United States, is not involved but is charged in an unrelated state campaign finance case in his native Texas.
DeLay left his leadership position because of the charges but has denied them.
The Scanlon case, closely tied to Republican politicians, has the potential of becoming another headache for the party.
It already is reeling from the DeLay case, the recent indictment of Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, various allegations against Scanlon's lobbyist partner, Jack Abramoff, and President George W. Bush's plummeting popularity figures.
The eight page information says Scanlon and a person identified only as "Lobbyist A" provided "a stream of things of value" to a member of Congress, identified only as "Representative No. 1," to aid their effort to pass legislation.
It has been a matter of public record for more than a year that Scanlon and Abramoff had a fee splitting arrangement and represented several Indian tribes.
Among the people subpoenaed in the Scanlon and Abramoff investigation was Rep Bob Ney, a Republican from Ohio, whose name surfaced almost a year ago in a Senate Indian Affairs Committee investigation as having extensive dealings with the two lobbyists and their tribal clients.
Ney has denied wrongdoing and started a legal defense fund.
Court papers filed by prosecutors say that Scanlon and the lobbyist "sought and received Representative No. 1's agreement to perform a series of official acts."
The acts, said the court papers, included "agreements to support and pass legislation, agreements to place statements into the Congressional Record, meeting with Lobbyist A and Scanlon's clients, and advancing the application of Lobbyist A for a license to install wireless telephone infrastructure in the House of Representatives."
Charges outlined in documents filed Friday said Scanlon and Lobbyist A cheated tribes in Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and Michigan of millions of dollars associated mainly with Indian casinos.
The closing of the Speaking Rock Casino near El Paso in February 2002 was one of John Cornyn's proudest moments as Texas attorney general.
His determination to shut down the Tigua Indian tribe's casino because it was opened in violation of state law earned the Texas Republican kudos and pledges of support from Christian political organizers backing that proved helpful as Cornyn made his successful run for the U.S. Senate that year.
House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R Sugar Land, for weeks has been in an all out political war, defending himself from allegations of ethical lapses, many of them connected directly or indirectly to the battle over tribal casinos.
But Cornyn's role in the casino controversy is only beginning to draw attention.
The shuttering of the Speaking Rock Casino is being explored by investigators for the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, as well as a federal multi agency task force and grand jury that are examining the actions of Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff and public relations associate Mike Scanlon.
Abramoff and Scanlon had many Indian gaming clients, including the Tigua Ysleta de Sur Pueblo, as the Tigua are known.
The lobbyists are at the center of a fraud and fund raising scandal that has embroiled DeLay.
Cornyn, elected senator in 2002, was supported in his anti Speaking Rock effort by a grassroots campaign led by conservative Christian lobbyist Ralph Reed, who organized pastors around the state to oppose gaming and back the attorney general.
Senate investigators discovered that Abramoff hired Reed to block gaming expansion in Texas and Louisiana and that the $4 million that Reed was paid actually came from Abramoff's Indian gaming clients.
Then, Abramoff and Scanlon secured the Tigua as a client on the day the casino was closed and charged them $4.2 million for a campaign to reopen it through federal legislation.
In an interview, Cornyn said he was "unaware" of Reed's role in Texas although he knew Reed from GOP political circles.
"I, of course, had filed the lawsuit earlier on.
That was already a done deal," Cornyn said.
"It was nice to receive that support, but it didn't have much to do with what we were already doing."
Cornyn's office filed the lawsuit, charging the tribe with violating the anti gambling terms of a law giving them federal recognition, in September 1999.
"I never met with him," Cornyn said of Reed, dismissing e mail traffic in 2001 and 2002 between Reed and Abramoff that suggests a close alliance with the Texas attorney general during the lengthy court decisions and appeals.
"I'm sure my name has been taken in vain before, so I'm not surprised," said the Texas senator.
"Maybe lobbyists were engaged in self promotion.
I was doing my duty to enforce the law."
Cornyn said that he does not recall any contact with Abramoff and did not know that the lobbyist contributed $1000 to his 2002 campaign.
Despite Cornyn's image as a gaming foe, he received $6250 in contributions for his 2002 race from Las Vegas casino interests, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which compiled data from the Federal Election Commission.
Some of the contributions were made at the same time Cornyn was pushing to close the Tigua casino.
Asked whether he opposes gambling, Cornyn replied: "No, not if it's in compliance with the law.
It's legal to gamble in Nevada, and it's not legal to gamble in Texas."
During the 2002 campaign, Cornyn attended a fund raiser at the home of Las Vegas entertainer Wayne Newton in an event organized by Sen John Ensign, R Nev.
The contributions at the May 29 event are a small part of the $9.8 million that Cornyn received in the 2002 race.
Asked about Abramoff's alleged double dealings with the Tigua, Cornyn said, "Without prejudging, I find it somewhat disturbing."
In a series of e mails released by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Cornyn's name appears numerous times in communications among Reed, Abramoff and Scanlon.
As a result, he has drawn some criticism.
"Cornyn is getting a pass that he doesn't deserve," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, referring to the lack of attention to the senator's involvement.
"My concern is that he's working with Ralph Reed, who's being paid by Indian gaming interests," Sloan said.
On Nov 12, 2001, Abramoff and Reed discussed strategy for supporting Cornyn.
Reed writes Abramoff: "Great work.
Get me details so I can alert Cornyn and let him know what we are doing to help him."
Cornyn said he had no contact with Reed.
Reed, former executive director of the Christian Coalition, was hired by Abramoff, an old friend, who was working at the Greenberg Traurig law firm.
The firm forced him out a year ago when it discovered Abramoff had hidden at least $10 million from Indian clients.
Reed's company, Century Strategies, was paid by Scanlon's companies.
Reed denies knowing that he was being paid by Indian tribes.
"Jack hired Ralph to organize a grassroots coalition to close one casino and prevent another casino from opening," said Lisa Baron, Reed's spokeswoman, "which was in line with Ralph's philosophical views and grassroots business."
However, in an e mail sent Jan 7, 2002, there is the suggestion that Reed knew who he was working for.
Reed wrote Abramoff: "Hope these developments help with client."
"We are proud of the work we did in closing the casino," Baron said.
"We did not know of any specific clients or any specific interests involved.
We are in the business of closing casinos.
"How would we know where the money was coming from?"
Reed is well connected politically.
A former Georgia GOP chairman, he was the Southeast regional campaign chairman for the Bush Cheney 2004 presidential campaign.
The Louisiana Coushattas paid Reed $3 million, fearing casino competition from another tribe in Louisiana and the expansion of gaming in Texas, which would probably draw gamblers away.
The Louisiana Coushattas, who paid Abramoff and Scanlon more than $30 million, have sued Abramoff, Scanlon, and Greenberg Traurig, accusing them of a variety of abuses, including fraud, overbilling and negligence.

Saudi Arabia is offering Indonesia five of its aircraft to be used in the tsunami relief operation and has pledged 100 million dollars in aid, the state Antara news agency said Sunday.
"The assistance in the operation of the country's aircraft for Aceh could be provided if the Indonesian government approves it," Antara quoted Abdurahman As Shalaewan, the head of Saudi's Red Crescent, as saying.
He also said the kingdom would provide a total of 100 million dollars in humanitarian aid.
Thirty million dollars of the funds will be immediately handed over while the remaining has been collected from the people of Saudi Arabia, As Shalaewen said.
Saudi Arabia, he said, will immediately discuss another aid package for Aceh in the post disaster period for building houses.
Former US presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush arrived in Sri Lanka Sunday for a tour of the tsunami battered island nation where nearly 31000 people perished on December 26.
The pair landed at Bandaranaike international airport around 4:15 pm (1015 GMT) from Indonesia and were due to hold talks later in the day with President Chandrika Kumaratunga about tsunami relief operations.
The two were received by Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar and two other ministers.
On Monday they will visit the town of Matara, 160 kilometres (100 miles) south of Colombo, for a brief tour of house reconstruction and trauma counseling programs funded by the US Agency for International Development.
Bush and Clinton were appointed by President George W. Bush to head US private fundraising efforts in the wake of the tsunamis that killed at least 288800 people in 11 countries in Asia and Africa.
Clinton is also the United Nations' special envoy for tsunami relief.
He and Bush began their four nation tour in Thailand before going on to Indonesia, from where they flew to Sri Lanka.
From Sri Lanka, they will head to the Maldives where one third of the 300000 population was affected by the tsunamis that killed 82 people and left another 26 missing.
About 15000 Maldivians are still homeless.
The United Nations was to announce Tuesday that former US president Bill Clinton would be named special envoy for tsunami relief, UN sources said.
Asked about the appointment earlier in the day, UN spokesman Fred Eckhard said he could not confirm the news but that a formal announcement would be made "in a few hours."
Clinton and his predecessor, George Bush, have already been asked by Bush's son, President George W. Bush, to lead private US fundraising efforts for the victims of the December 26 killer waves, which left more than 157000 people dead.
Australia's world number three Lleyton Hewitt has auctioned three of his tennis racquets to raise money for the Asian Tsunami Relief Appeal.
Almost 45000 dollars (31500 USD) has so far been raised with the help of the sponsor of the Sydney International tennis tournament to help the tsunami victims.
Over 21000 dollars was raised in around five minutes' auctioning of Hewitt's racquet, donated by the player, after his second round victory over Frenchman Arnaud Clement here on Wednesday.
A 7000 dollar final bid by a spectator was matched two for one by the tournament sponsor Medibank Private.
Further bidding on Thursday raised a total of 20000 dollars for Hewitt's second racquet and a third tennis racquet was to be auctioned Friday to further swell the fund raising.
The December 26 tsunamis killed more than 163000 people along Indian Ocean coastlines and left thousands more missing.
The money raised for the Tsunami Relief Appeal at the Sydney International will go to UNICEF and World Vision, organisers said.
Three Swiss army helicopters lent to the United Nations have finished their tsunami relief mission in Indonesia, a spokesman for the operation said Sunday.
Since their deployment on January 17, the Puma helicopters have transported 368 tonnes of humanitarian aid, including medicines, tents and blankets to regions isolated after roads and bridges were destroyed in the December 26 tsunami, Francois Furrer said.
A total of 2267 people including refugees and emergency workers were transported by the helicopters which flew their last mission Sunday for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, in the province of Aceh.
China's Shanxi Province handed a consignment of medical equipment and cash (all worth 180000 dollars) to Thailand to help with the tsunami relief efforts.
An official from the province said Wednesday that the donation was an expression of Shanxi's sympathy for the disaster victims.
He also noted the donation was a way of thanking Thailand for helping Shanxi when it suffered from flooding.
Thai Finance Minister Somkid Jatusripitak said this was a gesture of the fraternal relationship between Thailand and Shanxi, pledging to further boost economic ties between them for mutual good.
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government has granted a total of 1.5 million HK dollars (192000 US dollars) for tsunami relief work in India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, a government press release said here Monday.
The government has accepted the advice of the Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee and approved a grant of 500000 HK dollars (64100 US dollars) to Cedar Fund to provide relief aid to tsunami victims in India and another two grants each of 500000 HK dollars to the Association of Chinese Evangelical Ministry Ltd for its tsunami relief work in Sri Lanka and Indonesia.
The committee hopes the grants will help provide relief to tsunami victims in these countries.
To ensure that the money will be used for the designated purposes, the committee will ask Cedar Fund and the Association of Chinese Evangelical Ministry Ltd to submit evaluation reports and audited accounts on the use of the grant after completion of the relief projects.
So far, the Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee has approved nine applications from five relief agencies to carry out relief work in tsunami struck countries.
The total amount of grants made amounts to 22.5 million HK dollars (2.88 million US dollars).
The Disaster Relief Fund was established in December 1993 for emergency disaster relief in places outside Hong Kong.
The Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for advising the government on the policy and practices regarding the disbursement of funds for disaster relief, advising on specific amounts to specific recipients, and monitoring the use of grants.
The Tiger Woods Foundation is giving 100000 U.S. dollars to earthquake tsunami relief efforts in Asia, and the PGA Tour is matching that amount.
Woods' foundation and the tour are donating the money to Give2Asia, with the money directed toward two groups aimed at providing sanctuary and relief to children affected by the tsunami, according to reports from Anahelm, California, on Wednesday.
The Rajaprajanukroh Foundation supports children who have been orphaned in tsunami affected provinces.
The Holt Sahathai Foundation provides services such as adoption, pregnancy counseling, foster care, and education for children in hospitals and orphanages through Thailand.
Woods' mother was from Thailand, although he said last week none of her family was affected by the December 26 tsunami that killed more than 150000 in 11 countries, reports said.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said here Saturday it has pledged 800 million dollars for Indonesia in 2005 on top of the support being provided for tsunami relief and rehabilitation in that country.
"Disbursements under these commitments will be additional to the significant special financial and operational support that ADB will be providing for rehabilitation and reconstruction work in the tsunami affected areas," the bank said.
The new aid to Indonesia will go to infrastructure, local government finance, water resources, agriculture productivity, education, and nutrition, vice president Joseph Eichenberger was quoted as saying.
Despite progress on the macroeconomic front, Indonesia still faces "several significant structural challenges," such as the need for massive investment and greater predictability and clarity in administration, the bank said in a statement from its headquarters in the Philippine capital.
The 800 million dollars will focus on medium term economic needs such as improving governance and fighting corruption, decentralization, promoting human development, improved environmental management and "increasing long term growth prospects."
The ADB has already allocated an initial 675 million dollars for the rehabilitation and reconstruction effort in Indonesia, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka which were all hit by the quake spawned killer tsunamis in December.
Hong Kong superstar Andy Lau opened his wardrobe, donating clothes and other personal items, for a charity jumble sale that raised some 38000 dollars for tsunami relief, reports said Monday.
Movie and pop heart throb Lau donated 14 stage costumes for the Sunday auction in aid of the thousands affected throughout South and Southeast Asia in the December 26 disaster.
More than 30000 dollars were raised separately for a local youth charity in a similar auction of clothes donated by other celebrities, including singer Aaron Kwok and former deputy leader and fashion icon Anson Chan.
Kwok contributed to the fund, bidding almost 5000 dollars for a gold mobile phone signed by tycoon Li K shing.
An Australian telethon raised 15.2 million dollars (10.9 million US) in tsunami relief Saturday.
The telethon, broadcast simultaneously by all three of Australia's normally fiercely competitive commercial television stations, featured a concert involving some of the country's top pop stars.
The concert, titled "Australia Unites Reach Out To Asia", was staged in front of an audience of several thousand at the Sydney Opera House, while television personalities hosted the telethon in Melbourne.
The donations come on top of more than 120 million already handed over by Australia and a one billion dollar aid package pledged by the government.
It was the first time Australia's television networks have cooperated in such an appeal.
An all star international cricket match featuring the best of Asia versus the rest of the world to be held in Melbourne on Monday is expected to raise another five million for tsunami relief.
Stars of sound and cinema in Canada are getting in on the fundraising act to help victims of the tsunami, it is reported here Thursday.
Plans are in the works for several big concerts, with the proceeds going to various charities involved in the tsunami relief effort.
Canadian record label Nettwerk Management has enlisted some of its big guns to perform in benefit concerts at the end of the month.
Among the stars who will take part are: Avril Lavigne, Sarah McLachlan, Sum 41 and the Barenaked Ladies.
The concerts will be held on January 29 in Vancouver and January 31 in Calgary.
Canadian Television will broadcast January 29 concert live from Vancouver.
Money raised from ticket sales will be distributed to four charities involved in Tsunami relief.
US President George W. Bush has donated 10000 dollars from his personal funds to the relief effort of tsunami hit nations, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Wednesday.
McClellan, White House press secretary, said Bush has written checks totaling 10000 dollars to several organizations listed on a Web site set up to direct Americans to various charities collecting private contributions for tsunami relief.
However, McClellan did not identify the charity organizations to which Bush contributed.
Bush has pledged that the United States will contribute an aid of 350 million dollars to help the tsunami struck nations in South Asia and Southeast Asia.
Bush has been under criticism for responding slowly to the tsunami disaster that has killed over 150000 people.
Public and private aid pledged worldwide for the countries hit by the Asian tsunami disaster has surpassed 10 billion dollars, according to an AFP tally.
The figure includes government pledges and donations made by 42 countries, as well as debt relief and loans.
According to the AFP tally, public aid made by governments totals slightly more than eight billion dollars and private donations amounted to over two billion dollars.
Actress Sandra Bullock has given one million dollars to the American Red Cross to boost its tsunami relief campaign, the organisation said Monday.
The funds from the Hollywood actress will be used to provide relief supplies, financial support and technical assistance, the American Red Cross said in a statement.
"Bullock contacted the Red Cross last week to make this, her second million dollar gift, to the American Red Cross," added the statement.
The star of "Speed" and "While You Were Sleeping" also gave one million dollars after the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington.
"Sandra continues to enable our lifesaving work and is a model for personal generosity," said Marsha J. Evans, the American Red Cross president.
President George W. Bush Saturday urged Americans to contribute to charities responding to the tsunami disaster, saying he had extended a tax benefit for Americans who support such groups.
The world is "seeing the good heart of America in an outpouring of generosity here at home," Bush said in his weekly radio address.
"Private citizens are showing their compassion in creative and inspiring ways."
He noted that he had recruited two former presidents, his father, George Bush, and Bill Clinton, "to encourage contributions both large and small, directly to the organizations with recovery efforts underway in the disaster area.
"To encourage support for these groups, I have signed legislation allowing Americans to deduct from their 2004 federal income tax cash contributions made to tsunami relief efforts this month.
I urge all Americans to contribute as they are able."
Americans who contribute a certain portion of their income to charity can avoid paying taxes on that amount.
Under the new law donations made to tsunami relief this January can still be deducted on tax returns filed for calender year 2004.
The United Nations said Tuesday it had secured aid commitments worth 717 million dollars towards its appeal for emergency relief after the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster.
The largest contribution came from Japan which pledged 250 million dollars, the UN's emergency relief coordinator Jan Egeland said here after a conference grouping donor nations and aid agencies.
"It's money in the mail, it will be there within days," Egeland said.
Following is a list of the main contributors, as named by the UN official, specifically to the appeal launched last week for 977 million dollars.
It does not include aid promised for other parts of the huge tsunami relief operation, which amounts to some eight billion dollars in total.
A Chinese couple has donated 600000 dollars to the tsunami relief effort as China's public contributions topped 12 million dollars Sunday, state media said.
The Red Cross Society of China said the couple, who refused to give their names, made their contribution on Friday, Xinhua news agency reported.
The first two million dollars of donations collected have already been given to Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives, Red Cross spokesman Wang Xiaohua said.
Additional relief materials including medicine, water and clothes would be airlifted to the disaster hit countries soon, he added.
Among other notable donations has been 1.8 million dollars by China's State Development Bank and 120000 dollars by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.
The Chinese government has pledged 83 million dollars in relief aid and is forgiving four million dollars in government loans to Sri Lanka, one of the 11 countries battered by the tsunami.
A Canadian couple on Monday stunned the Canadian Red Cross by handing over a donation of five million Canadian dollars (4.1 million US) for the tsunami relief effort in South Asia.
Their offer will be worth 10 million dollars (8.2 million US) under the Canadian government's scheme to match all private donations to approved aid agencies in the wake of the December 26 disaster.
The gift, by Kroum and Eva Pindoff, who made their fortune by founding the record retailer Music World, is the largest ever gift to the Canadian Red Cross during a disaster appeal, the organisation said.
The couple pledged 100000 Canadian dollars (82000 dollars US) for tsunami relief on Friday, but after reflecting on the disaster, decided to do much more.
"After seeing more stark images of this tremendous tragedy and misery, my wife and I were up most of the night, grief stricken," Kroum Pindoff said.
"We wanted to help alleviate the suffering, and decided we had to make a more substantial gift."
Donations to an Australian tsunami relief telethon exceeded 20 million dollars (15.3 million US dollars) Sunday as pledges continued to roll in one day after the event.
World Vision Australia, the charity benefiting from the telethon, said it was overwhelmed by the public's response, which comes on top of more than 120 million already handed over in private donations and a one billion dollar aid package pledged by the government.
"Australians have given more per capita than any other country on the earth," World Vision spokeswoman Belinda Richardson said.
In an unprecedented move, Saturday's telethon and an accompanying pop concert at the Sydney Opera House were broadcast simultaneously by all three of Australia's normally fiercely competitive commercial television stations.
Volunteers planned to staff phones throughout Sunday and organisers said they hoped the total would rise further.
An all star international cricket match featuring the best of Asia versus the rest of the world to be held in Melbourne on Monday is expected to raise another five million for tsunami relief.
A new book about "Deep Throat" by Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward says W. Mark Felt denied being the Watergate source during a 1976 grand jury appearance, according to the newspaper USA Today.
The book, "The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat," says Felt hastily withdrew his denial when a Justice Department official reminded him he was under oath, according to the newspaper, which said it obtained a copy from a Virginia bookstore that mistakenly put copies out for sale.
The book is due in stores next Wednesday.
According to USA Today, the book says Woodward suspected that someone at the Post was leaking information about his sources to the Nixon White House.
No leaker was found.
The book also identifies the suburban garage where Woodward and Felt, a high ranking FBI official, conducted their clandestine late night meetings, a scene made famous in the movie "All the President's Men.?
In the grand jury incident, Woodward wrote that Felt's actions enabled the Justice Department official who was questioning him to realize that he had been "Deep Throat."
A grand juror asked whether Felt was "Deep Throat" and Felt replied, "No." The Justice Department official, Stanley Pottinger, offered to have the question and answer withdrawn as being outside the bounds of the investigation, after reminding Felt that he had sworn to tell the truth.
"Flushed," Woodward writes, "Felt very rapidly requested, 'Withdraw the question.'"
Pottinger did not reveal what he had figured out because he did not think it appropriate to divulge a reporter's confidential source, Woodward wrote.
Woodward wrote that Felt was motivated by a desire to protect the FBI, disgust with the Nixon White House, reverence for former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and the thrill of "the game."
President Richard Nixon resigned during the Watergate scandal.
The attorney who wrote the article revealing Deep Throat's identity approached the three years leading up to the Watergate whistleblower's "coming out party" much as he would a court case.
To convince the world that Mark Felt was indeed Deep Throat, "I looked at it as a trial in which the jury would be 1 billion people with a 48 hour deliberation period," John O'Connor said Tuesday during a lunch organized by the Bar Association of San Francisco.
Up to that point, Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein had steadfastly refused to reveal Deep Throat's identity.
As it turned out, soon after Felt came clean, they did too.
O'Connor says he met Felt, a frail 91 year old former FBI agent, because his daughter is friends with Felt's grandson.
Three years later, when Felt decided he was ready to reveal his role in history, O'Connor was ready with a national media strategy and a breaking story for Vanity Fair.
"I had to put a very compelling case together in 15 and 30 second sound bites," O'Connor said.
"My client doesn't remember things, and if he doesn't have a voice now, then who better to speak for him than his lawyer?"
O'Connor wrote the article exposing his client as the Washington Post's exclusive tipster during the Watergate scandal.
Once the story appeared in Vanity Fair, O'Connor took off to New York on a two week talk show circuit.
On June 16, he signed a book deal and optioned the story to Universal for what he calls "one hell of a movie."
The daughter of the former FBI agent who was revealed this week as "Deep Throat" has acknowledged that money played a role in the family's decision to go public.
W. Mark Felt, 91, was the key source in The Washington Post's Watergate investigation that helped bring down President Richard Nixon.
Felt stepped forward last week, ending a three decade debate about the source's true identity.
"He is relieved to get the secret off his chest," Joan Felt said of her father in an interview published Sunday in The Press Democrat.
Joan Felt, 61, told the newspaper there were many reasons her family wanted to reveal the elder Felt's role in Watergate after three decades, but added, "I won't deny that to make money is one of them."
Some literary agents have said the family could earn more than $1 million (euro810000) from a book deal.
"My son, Nick, is in law school and he'll owe $100000 (euro81374) by the time he graduates," she said.
"I am still a single mom, still supporting them to one degree or another, and I am not ashamed of this."
Joan Felt said her father suffered a stroke in 2001 and has undergone surgeries for heart problems and a broken hip but is still lucid.
"We had to help him see that most of the world now considers what he did heroic," she said.
"At the time it was happening, he wouldn't have gotten that percentage of support, but history has shown it was so important what he did."
L. Patrick Gray III, the acting director of the FBI at the time of the Watergate break in, ended more than three decades of silence about his role in the scandal, saying in a television interview broadcast Sunday that he felt shock and betrayal by the disclosure that his former deputy, W. Mark Felt, was Deep Throat.
In an interview on the ABC News program "This Week," Gray said he felt "like I was hit with a tremendous sledgehammer" by Felt's recent disclosure that he was the secret source for Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, The Washington Post reporters who broke important Watergate news relying on Felt's information.
Gray, 88, resigned from the FBI in disgrace in 1973.
In the ABC interview with George Stephanopoulos, he spoke bitterly of Felt, saying, "He told me time and again he was not Deep Throat."
If he could, Gray said, he would say to Felt: "Mark, why?
Why didn't you come to me?
Why didn't we work it out together?"
Gray said he now realized that he failed to halt news leaks from the bureau during Watergate because Felt was in charge of stopping them.
"I think he fooled me, if you want to put it that way, Mr Stephanopoulos, by being the perfect example of the FBI agent that he was," Gray said, according to a transcript of the interview.
"He did his job well, he did it thoroughly, and I trusted him all along, and I was, I can't begin to tell you how deep was my shock and my grief when I found that it was Mark Felt."
Gray's memories of events seemed sharp and his words were punctuated by flashes of anger as he defended his actions and insisted that he had been badly misled not only by Felt but also by President Richard M. Nixon and his aides.
In his 1979 book, "The FBI Pyramid From the Inside," Felt wrote contemptuously of Gray as an absentee director who compromised the bureau's independence by mishandling the break in inquiry.
Of his former subordinate, Gray said in the ABC interview, "He was a smooth operator, and I can't understand how Mark could have let himself do to me what he did when I trusted him so implicitly."
A retired FBI agent's assertion this week that several bureau officials collaborated to leak information about the Watergate investigation to The Washington Post did not surprise experts who have dissected the case for decades.
Some have long speculated that the media source known as Deep Throat didn't act alone, but Paul V. Daly's account of firsthand knowledge about the case has helped fuel renewed interest in what had become one of history's great modern mysteries.
Daly's disclosure came on the heels of former FBI Deputy Director W. Mark Felt's admission last week that he was Deep Throat.
According to Daly, who headed the Albany, N.Y., field office for six years beginning in 1980, Felt was part of a clandestine group of high ranking officials who agreed to leak information about the Watergate break in so that the publicity would counteract White House efforts to quash the probe.
He identified the others all deceased as Richard Long, who was chief of the FBI's white collar crimes section during Watergate, Robert G. Kunkel, agent in charge of the Washington field office, which led the Watergate burglary investigation, and Charles Bates, who was assistant director of the FBI's criminal investigative division.
"I think it's very, very possible because it explains some of the reasons why Felt could do it and why we thought he could not do it, because he had help," said Bill Gaines, who teaches an investigative journalism class at the University of Illinois and has studied Deep Throat extensively.
Daly's account "throws new light on the Felt story and makes much sense," said Gaines, who led a class that sifted through thousands of pages of FBI documents while researching the case.
Two years ago, the class fingered Fred Fielding, deputy to former White House counsel John Dean during the Nixon administration, as Deep Throat.
"But we were led away from the FBI by several misleading statements in 'All the President's Men' and the Post," said Gaines, a two time Pulitzer Prize winner.
"Now the possibility appears that additional information from other sources is included in the book and attributed to Deep Throat."
Neither Felt nor his family responded to an inquiry left on their telephone answering machine at their residence in Santa Rosa, Calif.
In an interview Tuesday, Ben Bradlee, the Post editor during Watergate, said he always thought that Felt had help.
There were other FBI officials who agreed with Felt's concerns about White House efforts to quash the investigation, Bradlee said, "I have always presumed that it wasn't just Felt, or, (that) there were people who were helping him," Bradlee said.
"The FBI was in a bit of upheaval.
I think there was some circling of the wagons."
Last week, Felt revealed in a Vanity Fair magazine article that he was Deep Throat, whose leaks to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward helped steer that paper's Pulitzer Prize winning coverage of Watergate.
The stories helped bring down the Nixon administration, led to the conviction of several top ranking federal officials, including a former attorney general and the White House chief of staff, and prompted fundamental changes in U.S. intelligence oversight.
John W. Dean III, who was Nixon's White House counsel and later served time for his role in Watergate, also said he was not surprised by Daly's disclosure.
Deep Throat "could not have done it alone," Dean said.
Daly said Long shared the story of Deep Throat during a meeting in 1978 in Washington, D.C., when they were discussing the disclosure of documents and potential testimony in the pending prosecution of Felt, Gray and Edward S. Miller, who was an assistant director with the FBI's intelligence division.
The three were accused of authorizing nine break ins at the homes of friends and relatives of members of the Weather Underground, an anti war group that had taken responsibility for bombing public buildings in the early 1970s.
At the time, Daly's job was to facilitate the turning over of FBI documents for the trials.
Daly said Long told him there might be a problem should Felt opt to testify at his trial.
Long then spelled out how he, Bates, Kunkel and others had funneled information to Felt that was then leaked to the press.
But not everyone believes the account.
Kunkel's son, Robert, who lives in Virginia, on Monday denied that his father had supported Felt or took part in leaking information to The Washington Post, calling Daly's account "ludicrous."
"My father never briefed Mark Felt.
He never conspired with Charlie Bates to deal with Mark Felt," said Kunkel, 49, who was a law enforcement officer and is now a car salesman.
"I'm sure Mr Felt was asking for information, but I also know that dad was trying to hold information back,I can remember my father being very frustrated during the time wondering who or what Deep Throat was."
Also, Robert Kunkel said his father confided in him years later that he believed someone else, other than Felt, was responsible for the leaks.
"He flat out thought someone else was Deep Throat," Kunkel said.
Still, Kunkel said his father was frustrated by attempts from top level officials, including Gray, to stonewall the investigation.
He recalled, as a teenager, watching his father's brown hair "turn snow white" during the long Watergate investigation.
"He would come home at night just absolutely fuming," Kunkel said.
"Then he would be back to work the next day with ideas of how to get around whatever road blocks they would set up."
But one veteran FBI official, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said he knew Kunkel well and that it's possible he kept the story Daly's account from his family.
"Nobody at that level shared anything with their wife or kids," he said.
"First of all, they had a tendency to repeat things and some stuff was so sensitive you'd end up in jail.
I can assure you Kunkel didn't."
Members of the FBI group, according to Daly, each brought snippets of information to the table.
Felt, who was the bureau's second in command, would glean information from the others, and that was part of the reason FBI and White House efforts to find Deep Throat were thwarted.
No one person could have known everything that Woodward and Carl Bernstein were reporting, Daly and others have said.
In Felt's 1979 book, "The FBI Pyramid from the Inside," he acknowledged receiving daily reports from Kunkel.
He also wrote that White House officials, including Dean, who was convicted of a felony for role in the Watergate scandal, regularly demanded access to the case information.
Gaines, who has reviewed more than 15000 pages of FBI documents related to Watergate, said Daly's account has helped add intrigue to Felt's admission.
"The whole thing is kind of shredded in my mind now," he said.
"Felt would not have known (everything that was being leaked), and someone else would've had to tell him.
It seems to me it really impeaches what Woodward and Bernstein have written and said about Deep Throat being a one person source."

Look at the photo of W. Mark Felt as a 45 year old FBI agent in 1958, and you begin to grasp something of the terrible ambivalence he endured over his role as Deep Throat.
Felt appears poised for action, knees bent.
In one hand, a drawn gun points at the camera, the other hand is raised slightly, as if to tell a bad guy, don't mess with me, fella.
His tie is fashionable, even edgy, his fedora is tilted just so, a handkerchief peeks from his breast pocket.
You can imagine him practicing the pose in front of the bedroom mirror before heading out to meet the newsmen from the local paper.
Even the name, Mark Felt, fits matter of fact, monosyllabic, the William condensed to a terse, Hooveresque initial.
He seems, in short, the perfect G man.
And G men not the G men of legend, anyway don't leak, don't skulk around parking garages dispensing Delphic tips.
It seems almost obvious, in retrospect, that Deep Throat came from the FBI.
Anyone else would have emerged from anonymity decades ago to revel in the glory of being the world's most famous unnamed source.
We'll never know, not for certain, what Felt thought of himself as Deep Throat, what it meant for him to carry that secret around for so many years and to deny his role so categorically.
Secrets are corrosive, the self help gurus insist, they must be purged.
Yet the more you read about Felt, the more you understand why, for him, keeping this secret buried may have been the better course.
"It was not I, and it is not I," Felt said in 1974 in denying that he was Deep Throat, and there is a sense in which that may have been not so much an outright lie as a deeper truth for Felt: In fact, he was not behaving like himself, or at least like the person he wanted to be.
When Slate's Timothy Noah tracked him down in 1999, Felt said it "would be terrible" if he had been Deep Throat: "This would completely undermine the reputation that you might have as a loyal, logical employee of the FBI.
It just wouldn't fit at all."
To comprehend how thoroughly Felt believed that it wouldn't fit for him to be both Mark Felt and Deep Throat, consider how insistently he kept his secret hidden from his own family.
The more you read of Vanity Fair's account of the outing, the sorrier you feel for a failing old man prodded and even tricked by his relatives into telling all to get "closure," as his daughter put it, perhaps finally to profit from what the family, if not Felt, viewed as his heroism.
Felt may have had lofty goals in helping Woodward.
But it is the rare source whose leak is solely a matter of altruism, and Felt, I suspect, had and at some level knew he had baser motives as well.
The most obvious, and most unattractive, is the fact that he had just been spurned for the top job at the FBI.
The astringency of Felt's account in his autobiography masks the depth of his hurt: "My own record was good and I allowed myself to think I had an excellent chance," he wrote.
There were other possible motives at work, too: the urge to protect Hoover's FBI from White House interference, the thrill of the spymaster turned bureaucrat at the chance for one last operation.
Richard Nixon would have understood Felt's reluctance to be unmasked, even if he guessed wrong about him.
In one of the grand pronouncements he was given to making on the White House tapes, Nixon weighed, and dismissed, the possibility that Felt was the leaker.
"The informer is not wanted in our society," he told White House counsel John Dean.
"Either way, that's the one thing people do sort of line up against."
Nixon assumed that Felt, if he were the secret source, would eventually be revealed and would pay the price.
"Everybody would treat him like a pariah," Nixon said.
"He's in a very dangerous situation."
Just a few years after his role in toppling the president, Felt found himself on trial for another clandestine operation.
He was charged with authorizing "black bag" jobs, break ins at the homes of relatives of members of the Weather Underground.
In this case, Felt and his co defendant were enveloped with FBI support, agents thronging the courtroom in a show of solidarity.
What would they have thought, Felt must have worried, if they knew his true, his alter identity?
Through all the years he steadfastly denied being Deep Throat, this was the audience whose reaction seemed to most concern him.
Flash forward from the crisp image of Felt as FBI man to the photographs of the frail 91 year old of today, leaning on his walker, his plaid shirt untucked.
I am glad, I suppose, to finally know the secret of Deep Throat.
I am less confident that Mark Felt wanted me to know.
Former FBI agent Mark Felt, 91, who in April revealed he was Deep Throat, the key secret source in the Watergate scandal, gave himself away at a grand jury hearing in 1976, The Washington Post said Friday.
Asked directly by then assistant Attorney General Stanley Pottinger if he was Deep Throat, Felt said "No" but with such a stunned look on his face that Pottinger surmised he was lying, the daily said quoting from an upcoming book.
The news came in Bob Woodward's book, "The Secret Man," which was rushed into publication following the revelation of Deep Throat's name two and a half months ago, said the daily.
Woodward, now an assistant managing editor at the Post, was a reporter when his friend Felt confided government secrets to him.
Based in part on Felt's inside information, Woodward along with fellow Post reporter Carl Bernstein, wrote the articles about the involvement of Nixon administration officials in the June 1972 burglary of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at Washington's Watergate complex.
The scandal and the White House's attempted cover up ultimately led to Richard Nixon becoming the first US president to resign in disgrace, in August 1974.
At the 1976 hearing, Pottinger reminded Felt he was under oath and withdrew his question as irrelevant to the subject of investigation at the time, but he told Woodward later of his conclusion, adding that he would keep it to himself.
"To his eternal credit" he did just that, wrote Woodward, who did not confirm Pottinger's suspicion, the daily said.
Felt was convicted in the Watergate scandal, but was later pardoned by president Ronald Reagan.
Sutton Place in central Fairfax County, Va., is a neighborhood of walkers.
Joan Bottrell was striding along Wynford Drive when a neighbor passed by and asked, "Do you know you live in a famous house?"
That was how Bottrell learned last week that her brick rambler at 3216 Wynford Dr was where Deep Throat Mark Felt lived with his family during the Watergate scandal in the early 1970s.
Felt, an FBI official, was Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward's secret source for articles that helped lead to President Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974.
Bottrell, a real estate agent with Avery Hess, said that when she bought the home in 1994, neighbors told her it once had belonged to Felt.
"I didn't think anything of it," said Bottrell, who said she did not remember reading about Felt during the Watergate years.
She said she did not connect Felt and Deep Throat until the neighbor told her about the revelation.
Built in 1965, the five bedroom, three bath house sits on an acre less than two miles west of the Capital Beltway.
The house, assessed this year at $511760, still has the swimming pool where Felt and his wife, Audrey, hosted neighborhood parties.
"He looked more like a movie star years ago than an FBI man," said Helen Swindler, one of the few neighbors remaining from the years when the Felt family lived on Wynford Drive, in the late 1960s and 1970s.
Swindler's house is four doors down from Bottrell's.
At one of those pool parties, when speculation about Deep Throat's identity was rampant, Swindler said she approached Felt with The Question.
"Could you be Deep Throat?"
Swindler said she asked Felt.
"Helen, no," Felt replied.
Swindler said she had no reason to believe Felt was not telling her the truth.
"He was very calm about it after I asked him," she said.
Felt's next door neighbors, Dexter and Jacqueline Benson, said they knew Felt was a senior FBI official but said they did not ask him if he was The Post's source.
"It had been rumored before, but Mark never said anything about it and we never asked him," said Jacqueline Benson, a former deputy superintendent of the Fairfax County schools system.
"You wouldn't have known anything by his behavior.
We assumed the rumors were wrong."
Benson said Felt was an ordinary suburban neighbor and, like many who lived on Wynford at that time, a World War II veteran.
Audrey Felt, a stay at home mother of two children, talked to Benson about her favorite soap operas.
The Felts were listed in the white pages of the phone book as late as 1970 71 but were not listed in the 1972 book, according to the Fairfax City Regional Library.
The Bensons, who moved into their home on Wynford in 1964 and still reside there, said they were the first to put in a swimming pool and persuaded Felt to do the same.
The Felts, who had a son, Mark, and daughter, Joan, often invited the Bensons and their children over for hamburgers on the patio, and the Bensons had the Felts over, too.
Dexter Benson was a cavalry officer at Fort Myer.
Jacqueline Benson said: "I think he was a very honest and caring person.
What he did was best for the country."
After the Felts' children left home, Swindler and Benson said, Felt and his wife wanted a smaller home, so they moved to a condominium in Alexandria, Va. Audrey Felt died in July 1984, when the couple was living in Alexandria, according to death records.
Felt later moved to Northern California, where he surfaced last week when the Deep Throat story broke.
Swindler was interviewed minutes after she had finished reading Woodward's account of how Felt became Deep Throat in the June 2 Post, which mentioned that Woodward had visited the Felts on Wynford before Watergate to seek career advice.
"I was excited about the news," Swindler said.
"I was like, 'Oh, wow.'
I think he's a hero.
He felt he did what he had to do."
Deep Throat has a book deal and a movie deal, and he could end up being played by Tom Hanks.
The family of 91 year old Mark Felt, who revealed his role as The Washington Post's key Watergate source two weeks ago, has chosen PublicAffairs Books to publish a combination of autobiography and biography, publisher and CEO Peter Osnos said Wednesday night.
Osnos said that Universal Pictures has optioned Felt's life story and the book for a movie to be developed by Hanks' production company, Playtone.
He said the book will blend Felt's own writing about his life, including his out of print 1979 memoir, "The FBI Pyramid: From the Inside," and some unpublished material, with contributions from Felt's family and from lawyer John O'Connor, who has been advising the Felts.
O'Connor wrote the Vanity Fair article that named Felt as Deep Throat after the secret had been kept for 33 years.
The additional material from Felt, Osnos said, includes discussion of how he decided to provide guidance to Post reporter Bob Woodward, and why.
The book is to be published next spring.
Its working title is "A G Man's Life: The FBI, Being 'Deep Throat' and the Struggle for Honor in Washington."
David Kuhn, the New York based agent who has been representing the family in conjunction with Beverly Hills, Calif. based Creative Artists Agency, said Wednesday night that "Hanks' company was interested in the rights to the story within a day or two" of the revelation of Deep Throat's identity.
He said the movie deal was concluded Tuesday night.
Kuhn would not comment on the sums paid in either the book or the movie deal, except to say that the family's decision on the book "was not based on money" but rather on the vision for its publication put forth by Osnos, a former Washington Post reporter and editor who helped cover the Senate Watergate hearings.
PublicAffairs generally doesn't pay advances of more than $75000.
Neither Felt's daughter, Joan, nor his son, Mark Jr., returned phone calls Wednesday night.
Kuhn said they would be "interviewed for the book and would participate in the storytelling."
During the two weeks the Felt project was being shopped, it met with considerable skepticism from publishers.
The two reasons usually cited were the health of the elderly Felt, whose physical and mental deterioration appeared to preclude new contributions from him, and the presence of a competing book from Woodward, who had already written his own version of the Deep Throat story.
Woodward's "The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat" is being rushed into print.
His publisher, Simon & Schuster, has set a publication date of July 6.
Warner Books publisher Jamie Raab said last week that she had heard the Felt pitch and decided not to bid.
"The book is not a Watergate book per se," Raab said.
"It's not going to answer some of the lingering questions,They're sort of writing around Mark Felt's life."
Little, Brown editor Geoff Shandler expressed skepticism as well, but he didn't rule out the success of a Felt book.
"Traveling in Woodward's wake could be a profitable place to be, depending on what you pay and when you publish," Shandler said.
"There is an equation that would work."
But publishing executives agreed that the real money was on the Hollywood end.
The identity of Deep Throat, The Washington Post's key Watergate source, was almost revealed nearly three decades ago, according to Bob Woodward's new book on his relationship with W. Mark Felt.
In "The Secret Man," to be published next week by Simon & Schuster, Woodward now a Post assistant managing editor writes that he learned in 1976 from then assistant attorney general Stanley Pottinger that Felt, who had been the No. 2 man at the FBI, had given himself away while testifying before a grand jury.
Asked, "Were you Deep Throat?"
Felt initially said, "No," but his stunned look alerted Pottinger to the probability that he was lying.
"The Secret Man" contains no major revelations.
Deep Throat's identity was revealed in a Vanity Fair article a month ago, and Woodward has already written the story in The Washington Post of how Felt became his famous secret source.
But the book adds numerous revealing details to the well known story.
In that grand jury proceeding, Woodward writes, Pottinger quietly reminded Felt that he was under oath.
He then offered to withdraw the question as irrelevant to the subject of investigation, which was illegal break ins conducted by the FBI in pursuit of antiwar radicals from the Weather Underground.
Felt quickly accepted the offer.
Pottinger told Woodward, who didn't confirm his conclusion, that he would keep his knowledge to himself.
"To his eternal credit," Woodward writes, he did just that.
Woodward also reveals for the first time the address of the famous Virginia parking garage where most of his meetings with Deep Throat were conducted: 1401 Wilson Blvd. in Rosslyn, Va.
The garage entrance he used is now 1820 N. Nash St. "The Secret Man" includes a chapter written by Woodward's Watergate reporting partner, Carl Bernstein.
In it, Bernstein recounts a conversation the two reporters deliberately excluded from their 1974 book, "All the President's Men," because President Nixon was still in office.
A year and a half earlier, Bernstein writes, as he and Woodward were about to write the first story pointing to former attorney general John Mitchell's involvement in the scandal, he realized that Nixon was likely to be impeached.
Woodward "looked at me for a second or two in the strangest way," Bernstein writes, then said, "Jesus, I think you're right."
The two then agreed that they should never use the word "impeachment" in the newsroom, because Post editors "might think we had an agenda or that our reporting was overreaching or even that we had gone around the bend."
Woodward writes that he and Bernstein later discovered that the Nixon administration may have had its own secret source within The Post, "someone who was leaking information to the Justice Department and the White House about our sources."
At one point during the height of the Watergate reporting, Woodward found himself interviewing Felt in his official capacity at his FBI office.
Another Post reporter had urged him to do so.
Rather than arouse suspicion, Woodward made an appointment and interviewed Deep Throat in the presence of his FBI assistant.
"Felt was proper.
He wouldn't answer anything.
I don't think he was rolling his eyes, but mine were spinning," Woodward writes, describing the episode as "a most uncomfortable charade."
At one point, years after Watergate, Post columnist Richard Cohen told Woodward that he was convinced Felt was Deep Throat and was planning to write a column saying so.
Woodward warned him off.
"I lied, and insisted to Cohen that he had it wrong.
W R O N G!
I spelled it out, I recall," he writes.
"Sorry, Richard."
In 1980, Felt was convicted of conspiring to violate the civil rights of those whose homes the FBI had illegally burglarized.
He was later pardoned by President Ronald Reagan.
In the 18 years that followed, Woodward writes, he made some "halfhearted stabs" at contacting Felt, but never reached him.
After a 1999 Hartford Courant story about Deep Throat quoted Felt as saying, "No, it's not me," Woodward writes, he finally called his old source, who was now living with his daughter, Joan, in Santa Rosa, Calif.
In the course of their conversation, Felt said among other things that cast doubt on his mental state that he had no memory of being convicted or pardoned.
The next month, Woodward went to see him.
Felt knew they had met, Woodward writes, but appeared to remember nothing about their Watergate transactions: "Did he recall being my source, the one that was called Deep Throat?
He said he didn't know."
Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein confirmed Tuesday that former FBI number two W. Mark Felt was the "Deep Throat" source who helped unravel the Watergate scandal and bring down President Richard Nixon.
"W. Mark Felt was 'Deep Throat' and helped us immeasurably in our Watergate coverage," Woodward and Bernstein said in a statement carried on The Washington Post web site.
"However, as the record shows, many other sources and officials assisted us and other reporters for the hundreds of stories that were written in The Washington Post about Watergate," they added.
Woodward, Bernstein and Ben Bradlee, the Post's executive editor when the Watergate story broke in 1972, said they kept the identity of "Deep Throat" secret at Felt's request, saying his name would be revealed upon his death.
"We've kept that secret because we keep our word," Woodward said.
They said they had decided to break their silence after Felt, now 91 and in declining health, was identifed as "Deep Throat" by his family and Vanity Fair magazine.
The Post said Woodward, now a Post assistant managing editor, will write an article for Thursday's newspaper about his and Bernstein's experience covering Watergate.
"The thing that stuns me is that the goddamn secret has lasted this long," Bradlee was quoted as saying by the Post.
Bradlee said he had learned the "positional identity" of "Deep Throat" as the Post was breaking its Watergate stories and had learned his name just after Nixon's resignation in August 1974.
"The number two guy at the FBI, that was a pretty good source," Bradlee was quoted as saying.
"I knew the paper was on the right track," Bradlee added.
The "quality of the source" and the soundness of his guidance made him sure of that.
Felt's family confirmed earlier Tuesday that the retired FBI official had been "Deep Throat" one of the best kept journalistic secrets of all time.
The Post said the Watergate break in in January 1972 came shortly after the death of legendary FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, who was Felt's mentor.
It quoted Woodward as saying that Felt had hopes of becoming the FBI director but Nixon appointed an official from his administration, L. Patrick Gray, to the post.
Bradlee said that over the years, "it was interesting to watch people flounder around with odd choices" about the identity of "Deep Throat," a nickname borrowed from the title of a pornographic film.
Although he knew the identity, Bradlee said: "I've never met Felt.
I wouldn't know him if I fell on him."
W. Mark Felt wanted to become FBI director.
President Richard M. Nixon and his closest aides thought that ambition might make Felt the ideal person to sidetrack an FBI investigation into the Watergate burglary.
They couldn't have been more wrong.
Rather than helping shield Nixon, Felt became the best known anonymous source in history.
As "Deep Throat," he was a key figure in uncovering the scandal that eventually led to Nixon's resignation.
Information was traveling from Felt, the No. 2 official at the FBI, to the news columns of The Washington Post via reporter Bob Woodward, snippets from a criminal investigation that led ultimately to the president.
The Post on its Web site Tuesday quoted Woodward as saying that Felt helped the newspaper at a time of tense relations between the White House and much of the FBI hierarchy.
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover died shortly before the Watergate break in.
Felt himself had hopes that he would be the next FBI director, according to the Post, but President Nixon instead appointed an administration insider, assistant attorney general L. Patrick Gray III, to the post.
Felt's ambition was no secret, as White House tape recordings from the Watergate scandal show.
Six days after the break in at the offices of the Democratic National Committee, President Nixon and his co conspirators discussed ordering the FBI to shut down its probe, on grounds that the investigation would interfere with a CIA operation.
"Mark Felt wants to cooperate because he's ambitious," White House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman said.
"Yeah," the president replied.
Months later on the Watergate tapes, Nixon and his aides discussed Felt as a possible leaker.
"We know who leaked it," Haldeman said on Oct 19, 1972.
"Somebody in the FBI?"
Nixon asked.
"Yes, sir, Mark Felt," Haldeman replied.
The Post's executive editor during Watergate, Ben Bradlee, said Tuesday it's a good thing for the country that Felt's identity has finally been revealed.
Bradlee has never met Felt, but "I would thank him" if the two men ever did get together, Bradlee said.
Felt had a storied career at the bureau, one that also had its share of controversy.
A jury found him guilty in 1980 of violating civil rights by authorizing warrantless searches at homes of friends and relatives of left wing fugitives during the early 1970s.
President Ronald Reagan pardoned him, along with another former FBI official convicted in the case.
Felt and his co defendant had argued they were authorized by their boss, Gray, who was then the acting FBI director, to approve break ins without first going to court for a warrant.
In breaking the story that Felt was "Deep Throat," Vanity Fair magazine wrote of his ascent inside the bureau run at the time by Hoover.
"In a move to rein in his power seeking head of domestic intelligence, William C. Sullivan, Hoover promoted Felt to a newly created position overseeing Sullivan, vaulting Felt to prominence," the magazine wrote.
A magazine named Felt as the likely Deep Throat in 1974, prompting a denial from Felt and a threat to sue that he never followed up on.
In 1992, former Post reporter James Mann wrote in The Atlantic Monthly that Deep Throat was certainly in the FBI, and named Felt as one of three likely candidates.
In the 2002 book "The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI," another former Post reporter, Ronald Kessler, wrote that Deep Throat was probably Felt.
Born in Twin Falls, Idaho, in 1913, he graduated from the University of Idaho, went to George Washington University Law School and joined the FBI in 1942.
The revelation that Mark Felt was the storied source who helped set in motion the events that ended a presidency not only resolved one of the United States' great political mysteries, it liberated a gallery of other high profile figures from decades of speculation.
Ferreting out Deep Throat's identity has long been a favorite topic in Washington and beyond, and the search has engaged former Nixon administration officials who dealt with the consequences of his leaks, intrepid journalism students eager to solve one of a prior generation's abiding enigmas, and many an armchair sleuth.
But then deputy White House counsel Fred Fielding, onetime Nixon aide Alexander Haig, speechwriter Patrick Buchanan and many others who have been mentioned as possible candidates in some cases based on circumstantial evidence at best may finally face fewer questions about the famous disclosures of over three decades ago.
"It ends the speculation," said Leonard Garment, who served as acting White House counsel during the investigation into the Watergate break in, and published a book called "In Search of Deep Throat" in 2000.
"Every good secret deserves a decent burial."
If so, then people have been clamoring to deliver the eulogy for years.
Some even claimed that Deep Throat played by Hal Holbrook in the film "All the President's Men" was actually an amalgam of different sources who provided Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein with key information for their reporting.
Others have focused on specific individuals, doggedly studying who might have had access to what kind of information, and cross referencing that detective work with other sources, including the book by Woodward and Bernstein upon which the film was based.
Two years ago, after a four year investigation, a journalism class at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign found "Fielding to be the most likely Throat candidate," according to a summary on deepthroatuncovered.com.
Tuesday, after Woodward confirmed that Felt was Deep Throat, William Gaines, the professor involved, said he and his students accepted that.
Fielding, who according to media reports had denied that he was Deep Throat, could not be reached for comment.
Another strain of thought focused on officials in the FBI.
In 1992, 20 years after Watergate, James Mann a former colleague of Woodward and Bernstein at The Washington Post laid out the tension between the White House and the FBI in the wake of J. Edgar Hoover's death in May 1972, months before the Watergate break in.
Mann, writing in the Atlantic magazine, stated flatly that he did not know who Deep Throat was.
But, Mann wrote, "He could well have been Mark Felt ,Felt was known in Washington as a person willing to talk to the press.
He has denied that he was Deep Throat."
Bob Woodward's book on "Deep Throat" will be rushed onto bookshelves by next month, his publisher said Thursday, two days after a monthly magazine revealed the famed Watergate source's real identity.
In a statement, Simon and Schuster said Woodward was still working on the book, which carries the title "The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat."
In the volume, which will be published in July, Woodward will discuss how he first met Mark Felt and how the former FBI official became the legendary secret source whose insider guidance was so critical to The Washington Post's coverage of the Watergate scandal.
"Bob Woodward's account will be the true final piece of the Watergate puzzle," said David Rosenthal, executive vice president of Simon and Schuster.
Woodward had been preparing his Deep Throat book for some time, with a view to publishing after Felt, now 91, died.
However, the unexpected revelation of Felt's secret in Vanity Fair magazine on Tuesday, meant the project was moved onto the fast track.
Woodward has authored or co authored 10 number one national non fiction best sellers, including the "All the President's Men" (1974) the definitive account of how he and fellow Post journalist Carl Bernstein unravelled the Watergate scandal that brought down president Richard Nixon.
One day after the disclosure that former FBI Deputy Director W. Mark Felt was Deep Throat, Washington was awash with claims from political celebrities and minor Watergate figures that they'd known the identity of the secret source all along.
Nora Ephron, the screenwriter and author who was once married to Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein who with colleague Bob Woodward played leading roles in exposing Watergate put out word on a blog that "I knew that Deep Throat was Mark Felt because I figured it out."
Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen wrote Wednesday that, even though he once reported that a mere Secret Service technician could have been Deep Throat, "I always suspected it was" Felt.
And longtime Washington pundit Robert Novak topped them all.
Even though Deep Throat's identity had been one of Washington's most enduring and fascinating mysteries, Novak declared that just about everyone in the Capital had known all along.
The morning after rush to claim prescience was one more indication, if one were needed, that to Washingtonians, the worst crime is being out of the loop.
Ephron, whose first novel, "Heartburn," was based on her marriage to Bernstein and became a 1986 movie directed by Mike Nichols, said on her blog that she did not learn of Felt's identity from her husband.
She said "he was far too intelligent to tell me a secret like that.
He refused to tell his children too, who are also my children, so I told them, and they told others, and even so, years passed and no one really listened to any of us.
"Years passed while unbelievably idiotic ideas of who Deep Throat was were floated by otherwise intelligent people," Efron preened.
Novak, who writes a column for the Chicago Sun Times that is nationally syndicated, was recently in the news for a controversy about a secret source.
Novak disclosed Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA operative based on a government leak that has sparked a federal investigation.
In a column posted Wednesday, Novak wrote that he was not alone in suspecting Deep Throat's identity.
It was virtually an open secret in Washington, he said: "Everybody knew that Felt was leaking information to Woodward and Bernstein about the Watergate investigation.
"The reporters made no secret of the fact that they were getting leaks from inside the FBI, and it was presumed that Felt was one of the leakers."
Tom Brokaw, the former NBC anchor who covered the Nixon White House, said he deduced that Felt was the source because Woodward and Bernstein had pledged to keep Deep Throat's identity a secret until after he died and few credible candidates were left on a short list.
"Well I had for a long time felt that he was kind of the last surviving possibility," Brokaw said on MSNBC's "Hardball with Chris Matthews" on Tuesday night.
"There were a lot of people on that list for awhile.
And they all seemed to fall away, either by absolute denials or they didn't match up (with) all the various criteria."
Some journalists did divine that Felt was Deep Throat, including James Mann, a former Los Angeles Times correspondent.
In an Atlantic Monthly article in 1992, Mann wrote that Deep Throat clearly was an FBI man.
And Ephron once rejected speculation by former White House counsel John W. Dean III that Nixon speechwriter David Gergen was Deep Throat by saying Gergen was "too tall" to have fit into the parking garage where Woodward met the source.
"They used to say the eighth deadly sin in Washington was losing, and the new one is being out of the loop," said Gergen, a Nixon adviser who said he was relieved to have the cloud of suspicion lifted from his head.
"Some of us have been in the lineup for about 30 years," he said.
A retired FBI official, Mark Felt, was the "Deep Throat" source who leaked secrets to two Washington Post reporters about the Watergate scandal that brought down former president Richard Nixon, his family said Tuesday.
Felt's grandson, Nick Jones, made the claim in a statement read to reporters outside the family home in Santa Rosa, California, following an article in Vanity Fair in which Felt told the magazine he was "Deep Throat."
The identity of the person who provided Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein with crucial information about the Watergate cover up has been one of journalism's most enduring mysteries.
Woodward and Bernstein have said they will not reveal the identity of "Deep Throat" until his death.
"My grandfather is pleased that he is being honored for his role as Deep Throat with his friend Bob Woodward," said the statement read by his grandson Jones.
"The family believes my grandfather, Mark Felt Sr., is a great American hero who went well and above the call of duty at much risk to himself," the statement said.
"We all sincerely hope the country will see him this way, as well.
"Mark had expressed reservations in the past about revealing his identity and about whether his actions were appropriate for an FBI man," the statement said.
"But as he recently told my mother, I guess people used to think Deep Throat was a criminal.
But now they think he's a hero."
The statement also called for reporters to respect the privacy of Felt, who is 91.
Aides to the late president Richard Nixon said Wednesday that former FBI deputy director Mark Felt, unmasked as the anonymous Watergate source known as "Deep Throat," had breached professional ethics by leaking information.
G. Gordon Liddy, a Nixon operative who engineered the 1972 break in at the Democratic National Campaign headquarters in the Watergate building in Washington, and served four and a half years in jail for it, said Felt "violated the ethics of the law enforcement profession."
"If he possessed evidence of wrongdoing, he was honor bound to take that to a grand jury and secure an indictment, not to selectively leak it to a single news source," Liddy, now a popular conservative radio talk show host, told CNN television.
"Deep Throat," named after an emblematic porn film of the time, helped Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein draw connections between the break in and the White House, eventually leading to Nixon's resignation under threat of impeachment.
Forty Nixon aides were indicted as a result of the break in in which burglars planted listening devices to spy on the Democrats during an election campaign.
Felt revealed Tuesday that he had secretly fed to Washington Post reporters information about crimes committed by members of the presidential entourage, who spun an intricate web of illegal political espionage and vendettas against those perceived to be Nixon's enemies.
Liddy suggested that Felt had been also aware of information that was damaging to the Democrats but chose to keep that silent about it, indicating he was driven by partisan politics.
Leonard Garment, Nixon's chief legal counsellor from 1969 1973, said he thought Felt kept his role in Watergate secret for 31 years "because he felt that what he had done could well be considered dishonorable."
Garment said the question was "when government persons, having private, secret, confidential information, are justified to become the whistle blower and defy or ignore their sworn obligation to maintain security and go to the press with it."
Chuck Colson, the head of White House communications in 1972, Felt could have helped America avoid a wrenching political crisis, the ripple effect of which was felt in the country for decades, if he had gone through proper channels.
"Mark Felt could have stopped Watergate," said Colson, who served time in jail and is now an evangelical Christian broadcaster.
"He was in a position of that kind of influence.
Instead, he goes out and basically undermines the administration."
Former Nixon speechwriter Pat Buchanan, in an appearance on MSNBC television, bluntly said Felt was a "traitor."
But David Gergen, another ex Nixon aide and one time Deep Throat suspect, was reserved, saying he was "relieved" he was no longer under suspicion.
Felt's disclosure was hailed by leading US dalies Wednesday as a prime example of how anonymous sources can keep government abuse in check.
"Had Felt remained quiet, Nixon might have succeeded in one of the most serious abuses of power ever attempted by an American president," said the Washington Post.
The New York Times wondered if a Watergate scandal today would similarly come to light.
"Now, at a time when reporters' right to keep sources secret is under so much attack, it's worth asking whether Deep Throat would have shared his secrets" if he had not been confident the Post reporters would keep the secret.
Former FBI deputy director Mark Felt was hailed as a hero and denounced as a villain Wednesday after confessing to being the Watergate scandal's "Deep Throat" a disclosure that startled even President George W. Bush.
Felt's family and The Washington Post, which spearheaded press coverage of the Watergate cover up in the early 1970s, confirmed that Felt was the celebrated anonymous source whose leaks helped bring down President Richard Nixon.
"I'm the guy they used to call Deep Throat," Felt, now 91, told Vanity Fair in an article published that was the talk of the nation on Wednesday.
"All I can tell you is that it was a revelation that caught me by surprise," President Bush told reporters, summing up the feeling of many in the Washington establishment.
"For those of us who grew up, got out of college in the late '60s, the Watergate story was a relevant story," Bush said.
"And a lot of us have always wondered who Deep Throat might have been.
And the mystery was solved yesterday."
Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was appointed by Nixon as the US ambassador to NATO, in the 1970s, gave a guarded response when asked if he thought Felt had been right to leak confidential information.
"Well, I'm not in any judgmental mood," Rumsfeld told a Pentagon briefing.
Prepared in strict secrecy by the magazine, the Vanity Fair article flat footed former Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein who, along with the newspaper's former editor Ben Bradlee, had kept Felt's identity secret for more than 30 years.
After initially refusing to confirm Felt as the source, Woodward and Bernstein eventually gave in.
"Mark Felt was Deep Throat and helped us immeasurably in our Watergate coverage," the statement said.
The two were preparing a major article about their contacts with Deep Throat to be published on Thursday.
Deep Throat met with Woodward several times to help break stories about the involvement of Nixon administration officials in the June 17, 1972 burglary of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington.
The scandal ultimately led to Nixon becoming the first US president to resign in August 1974.
Felt's grandson, Nick Jones, described his grandfather as "a great American hero" and said his family hoped the country would see him the same way.
But not everyone did especially former Nixon aides.
G. Gordon Liddy, a Nixon operative who served four and a half years in prison for engineering the Watergate break in, said Felt "violated the ethics of the law enforcement profession," while former Nixon speechwriter Pat Buchanan bluntly labelled him a "traitor."
Chuck Colson, the head of White House communications in 1972, said Felt could have helped America avoid a wrenching political crisis.
"Mark Felt could have stopped Watergate," said Colson.
"He was in a position of that kind of influence.
Instead, he goes out and basically undermines the administration."
Felt's disclosure received a more positive reception in the press, with several leading US dailies on Wednesday hailing Deep Throat as a prime example of how anonymous sources can keep government abuse in check.
Hal Holbrook, the actor who played the Deep Throat character in the 1976 Watergate movie "All The President's Men" said he thought Felt had been driven by a "higher purpose."
"The important thing was not who it was, but why he did it," Holbrook said.
"It's called morality.
That is something that is not very popular today."
Jones said his grandfather had initially previously expressed deep reservations about revealing his secret.
"But as he recently told my mother, 'I guess people used to think Deep Throat was a criminal.
But now they think he's a hero,'" Jones said.
Felt's family had no idea about his secret until 2002, when Felt's close friend and frequent social companion, Yvette La Garde, told his daughter Joan that Felt had confided to being Woodward's source.
The Vanity Fair article said Joan confronted her father, who initially denied it, but after she explained La Garde's disclosure, he responded: "Since that's the case, well, yes I am."
He finally gave in to family pressure to go public when his daughter persuaded him that the story could bring some financial benefit that would help pay for his grandchildren's education.
With the secret finally out, The New York Times said Watergate aficionados would mourn the end to a 30 year cottage industry of Deep Throat speculation.
"It's a little like discovering that Superman's secret identity was, well Clark Kent," the newspaper said.
Two years of negotiations, furtive planning and a team of editors sworn to silence allowed Vanity Fair to scoop The Washington Post on a story that, by rights, had belonged to the newspaper for 30 years.
The celebrity magazine's naming this week of former FBI assistant director Mark Felt as the famed Watergate source, "Deep Throat," was sensational on two levels the revelation itself and the fact that the Post, which had a proprietary grasp on Felt's secret for so long, was caught wholly flat footed.
"I had no idea it was coming," admitted Ben Bradlee, the Post's executive editor during the Watergate era and, along with reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, a guardian of Deep Throat's true identity for three decades.
The road to Vanity Fair's scoop began in 2003 with an unsolicited call to the monthly's editor Graydon Carter from a San Francisco lawyer, John O'Connor, who said he represented a client who was Deep Throat and who wanted to reveal his identity in the magazine.
According to Vanity Fair contributing editor David Friend, the magazine initially passed on the story after O'Connor insisted on payment for Felt and Felt's family.
O'Connor then sought to interest a publisher in getting the story out in book form, but failure led him back to Vanity Fair barely a year later.
Having checked the story with Felt's family and decided to run it, the magazine went into clandestine mode, assigning 15 editors and staff to the story, all of whom were made to sign confidentiality agreements.
In keeping with the "Deep Throat" tradition of subterfuge, the story was codenamed WIG (a corruption of Watergate) and Felt's daughter Joan, a key source, began referring to her father as "Joe Camel."
As the publication date neared, the magazine's editors sent the issue to the printers with a dummy coverline "The Door Slams."
One particular conundrum facing the magazine was whether or not to contact Woodward or Bernstein and ask them to confirm that Felt was indeed Deep Throat.
"If we called Woodward ,he could rush into print his own article about the source's identity," Graydon Carter said, adding that checking the story with Bernstein carried the same risk.
"So we didn't call either of them, realising that for 33 years they have consistently refused to divulge their source's name anyway," Carter said.
"And we chose, instead, to verify the facts surrounding this amazing tale of intrigue and courage as best we could, using alternative and overlapping sources," he said.
The final story carried O'Connor's byline, a fact that led some observers to question whether the lawyer might have violated the attorney client privilege with the 91 year old Felt.
When the Vanity Fair scoop broke, Woodward and Bernstein's initial reaction was to reiterate what they had said for years: that they would only reveal Deep Throat's identity when the source died.
But The Washington Post newsroom was thrown into confusion with the newspaper's executive editor, Leonard Downie, rushing back from a company retreat to handle the situation.
"I drove back very fast," Downie said.
After discussions with Woodward, Bernstein and Bradlee, Downie said a conclusion was reached that Felt and his family had released them from their promise of confidentiality and that the Post should confirm Felt's disclosure.
Downie insisted he was not upset at losing the scoop because Woodward and the newspaper had behaved "honourably" and "didn't want to push Mark Felt into doing something he didn't want to do."
Bernstein, meanwhile, said it was strange to have the secret known after such a long time.
"It's like having tried to protect something precious for all these years that you carry around, and for the first time it's not there to protect in your pocket anymore.
It's a very strange feeling," he said.
Bernstein added that he felt "relieved of an obligation."
Deep Throat, the secret source whose insider guidance was vital to The Washington Post's groundbreaking coverage of the Watergate scandal, was a pillar of the FBI named W. Mark Felt, The Post confirmed.
As the bureau's second and third ranking official during a period when the FBI was battling for its independence against the administration of President Richard M. Nixon, Felt had the means and the motive to help uncover the web of internal spies, secret surveillance, dirty tricks and coverups that led to Nixon's unprecedented resignation on Aug 9, 1974, and to prison sentences for some of Nixon's highest ranking aides.
Felt's identity as Washington's most celebrated secret source had been an object of speculation for more than 30 years until Tuesday, when his role was revealed by his family in a Vanity Fair magazine article.
Even Nixon was caught on tape speculating that Felt was "an informer" as early as February 1973, at a time when Deep Throat was supplying confirmation and context for some of The Post's most explosive Watergate stories.
But Felt's repeated denials, and the stalwart silence of the reporters he aided Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein kept the cloak of mystery drawn up around Deep Throat.
"He knew he was taking a monumental risk," said Woodward, now an assistant managing editor of The Post,whose catalogue of prizewinning and best selling work has been built on the sort of confidential relationships he maintained with Deep Throat.
Felt also knew, by firsthand experience, that Nixon's administration was willing to use wiretaps and break ins to hunt down leakers, so no amount of caution was too great in his mind.
Woodward rode multiple taxis, sometimes in the wrong direction, and often walked long distances to reach the middle of the night meetings.
Woodward and Bernstein expressed a concern that the Deep Throat story has, over the years, come to obscure the many other elements that went into exposing the Watergate story: other sources, other investigators, high impact Senate hearings, a shocking trove of secret White House tape recordings and the decisive intervention of a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court.
"Felt's role in all this can be overstated," said Bernstein, who went on after Watergate to a career of books, magazine articles and television investigations.
"When we wrote the book, we didn't think his role would achieve such mythical dimensions.
You see there that Felt/Deep Throat largely confirmed information we had already gotten from other sources."
Felt, 91 and enfeebled by a stroke, lives in California.
Despite a predawn federal appeals court ruling that rejected efforts to restore nutrition to Terri Schiavo, Gov. Jeb Bush succeeded on Wednesday in getting a state court to hear new motions in her case, presenting an affidavit from a neurologist who said Schiavo's condition appeared less severe than previously thought.
Bush held a news conference Wednesday afternoon to announce the affidavit and to suggest that officials might seek to gain legal custody of Schiavo.
Later, state lawyers appeared before Judge George W. Greer of Pinellas Pasco Circuit Court, who ordered Schiavo's feeding tube removed last week, and asked for the second time in a month to intervene in the case.
Greer did not rule on their request immediately, but he granted a request from Schiavo's husband, Michael, to bar the state's Department of Children and Families from taking custody of her, from removing her from the hospice where she has gone six days without her feeding tube, and from providing her with nutrition or hydration.
George Felos, the lawyer for Michael Schiavo, who had sought to end life support for his brain damaged wife, said he had heard "credible" rumors that state officials planned to send doctors to the hospice to give Terri Schiavo intravenous fluids.
Greer also directed state sheriffs to enforce the order.
The governor indicated that the state might indeed try to take custody of Terri Schiavo, which the law would allow it to do under certain circumstances.
He said a new review by Dr William P. Cheshire, a neurologist in Jacksonville, suggested that Schiavo had been misdiagnosed as being in a "persistent vegetative state," meaning she could not think, emote or remember.
Cheshire, who visited Schiavo in her hospice room for an hour and reviewed videotapes of her made by her parents, said that she appeared to be minimally conscious.
"This new information raises serious concerns and warrants immediate action," Bush said.
"If there's any uncertainty, we should err on the side of protecting her."
Even before dawn broke, the parents of Terri Schiavo were dealt a setback when a divided three judge panel of the federal appeals court in Atlanta refused to order Schiavo's feeding tube to be reinserted.
The decision followed the enactment by Congress of an unusual law allowing federal court review in the case.
But a federal judge in Tampa ruled that a lawsuit brought under the law had so little chance of ultimate success that there was no need to preserve Schiavo's life in the meantime.
The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday turned aside the case of Terri Schiavo, dimming her parents' hope of saving her, while religious activists made a final appeal to Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to defy the courts and intervene.
"I can't go beyond what my (legal) powers are, and I'm not going to," said a frustrated Bush, who expressed sympathy for Schiavo's family.
Terri Schiavo's condition deteriorated visibly seven days after her feeding tube was removed by court order.
Death was expected within a few days.
Mary Schindler visited her daughter early Thursday and left in tears.
Terri "looked like she just got out of Auschwitz," anti abortion activist Randall Terry said Schiavo's sister told him.
George J. Felos, the lawyer for Terri's husband, said Michael Schiavo was saddened by the protracted legal maneuvering but "very grateful" for Thursday's court action.
The tone of resignation from Bush sparked anger and disappointment among protesters standing vigil outside the hospice where Schiavo was being cared for.
Terry, who has been advising the Schindlers, said "there will be hell to pay" if the politicians whom religious conservatives had helped elect let Schiavo die.
The Supreme Court did not explain its decision to turn aside the right to die case, just as it had done in four previous appeals.
None of the justices registered a dissent.
That action was followed by rulings Thursday from Pinellas County Circuit Judge George W. Greer, who barred the state from attempting to take custody of Schiavo, 41, and reaffirmed that she would not want to be kept alive through artificial means.
In 1990, a potassium imbalance brought on by an eating disorder caused Schiavo to have a heart attack, which cut off oxygen to her brain.
She has been in what doctors say is a persistent vegetative state ever since.
Schiavo can breathe on her own but cannot eat or drink.
For seven years, Schiavo's husband and parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, have waged a court battle over her care.
The Schindlers maintain that her condition could improve with therapy.
But in 2000, Greer sided with Michael Schiavo and issued his first order to remove Terri's feeding tube.
In the years since, the tube has been removed and reinserted twice, following court challenges.
Greer on Thursday issued a detailed account of why he felt his original finding remained valid.
He said no treatment breakthroughs had occurred that would offer Schiavo any quality of life improvements.
The state immediately appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which refused to overrule Greer.
Outside the Woodside Hospice, about 100 protesters prayed for Schiavo's rescue as the Schindlers and their lawyers made another desperate plea to a federal district court judge for intervention.
As of Thursday evening, U.S. District Judge James D. Whittemore had yet to rule.
While the day's legal arguments were being made, the dying woman's sister and brother made short visits to her room.
"It's very frustrating," Bobby Schindler said as he shuttled between the hospice and a thrift shop across the street, where his family has taken refuge to avoid Michael Schiavo.
"Every minute that goes by is a minute that Terri is being starved and dehydrated to death."
Bush, the president's brother, had petitioned Greer to allow the Florida Department of Children and Families to take protective custody of Schiavo.
On Wednesday, he cited an affidavit from a Florida neurologist who contended that Schiavo might have been misdiagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state instead of a "minimally conscious" one.
But Greer disagreed, saying again Thursday that "by clear and convincing evidence, it was determined (Schiavo) did not want to live under such burdensome conditions and that she would refuse such medical treatment/assistance."
The drama surrounding Schiavo has played out against a political backdrop.
The U.S. Congress last weekend interrupted its spring recess to push through a law that allowed the Schindlers to take their case through the federal court system after they had exhausted all avenues in the state courts.
President Bush rushed back to the White House from his Texas ranch to sign the legislation in the predawn hours Monday.
But polls show that about two thirds of Americans say the government should stay out of such personal matters as end of life decisions.
The protesters outside the Woodside Hospice on Thursday appealed to Gov. Bush to disregard the rulings of more than two dozen state and federal judges over the past seven years and take custody of Schiavo by force.
"There's a constitutional crisis looming in the state of Florida," said the Rev. Pat Mahoney of the Washington based Christian Defense Coalition.
"The question is, will Gov. Bush allow a district court judge to tell him how to run his state?"
Terry accused the governor and the Department of Children and Families of raising the Schindlers' hopes of rescuing their daughter, only to cave in to "a runaway judiciary."
"The governor," said Terry, "blinked."
By evening, the crowd outside the hospice had grown to about 150.
"There seems to be no justice in the justice system forthcoming," said Paul Reese, from Carlisle, Pa., as he held up a sign urging prayers for Schiavo.
"It's still the duty of the governor of the state to see that the laws are upheld," Reese said.
"The Constitution of the state of Florida guarantees the life of all innocent people."
Williams reported from Pinellas Park and Savage from Washington.
A federal judge refused to order Terri Schiavo's feeding tube reinserted Tuesday, and as their legal options dwindled her stunned parents quickly appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which gave no hint when it would rule.
The parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, stayed mostly out of sight, but supporters said they were devastated and that their daughter's condition was deteriorating as the third court in a week considered her case.
In Tallahassee, other advocates of preserving Schiavo's life ratcheted up pressure on Gov. Jeb Bush and the state Legislature to find another solution.
Congress passed an unusual law on Monday allowing federal courts to intervene in the case, but a move that Republican leaders and Schiavo's family hoped would immediately block her death was proving more complicated.
In a ruling issued at dawn, Judge James D. Whittemore of U.S. District Court in Tampa wrote that the Schindlers had not established a "substantial likelihood of success" if a new trial were held in federal court.
The Schindlers appealed by midafternoon, telling a three judge federal appeals panel in Atlanta that their daughter must be reconnected to a feeding tube immediately or the efforts of Congress and President Bush to help keep her alive would amount to "a vain and useless act." Their lawyer, David Gibbs, also asked the panel to order doctors to resume feeding Schiavo while it weighed the appeal, writing, "Terri is fading quickly and her parents reasonably fear that her death is imminent."
While the fate of Schiavo was argued over in court papers, the case continued to roil Washington.
Some conservatives criticized the aggressive efforts of Congress to use the federal courts to override state rulings, saying it violated a cornerstone of conservative philosophy.
In addition, the case injected another explosive element into the congressional debate over Bush's choices for federal judgeships.
Outside the hospice where the severely brain damaged Schiavo, 41, entered her fifth day without nutrition and hydration, a spokesman for her parents said that Schiavo was "now showing signs of starving to death."
But a lawyer for Schiavo's husband, Michael, whom a state judge granted permission to disconnect her feeding tube and let her die, said she was not suffering.
"Terri is stable, peaceful, calm," the lawyer, George Felos, said.
Legal scholars said it would be highly unusual for the Atlanta appeals court to order the feeding tube reinserted based on its analysis of Whittemore's ruling.
But the Schiavo case has surprised at every turn.
The full US 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, Georgia, refused on Wednesday to reconsider a request to reinsert the feeding tube to a brain damaged woman in Florida, dealing another blow to hopes of her parents to keep her alive.
The 10 2 ruling came hours after a three judge panel from the appeals court ruled against the family.
The parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, suffered another setback Wednesday when the Florida legislature decided not to intervene in the struggle.
Florida Governor Jeb Bush, meanwhile, sought court permission to take custody of Terri Schiavo, 41, who was incapacitated in 1990 when her heart stopped briefly cutting oxygen to her brain.
President George W. Bush said on Wednesday that he had considered all options before the Congress passed an unprecedented legislation and he signed it into law over the weekend.
The law shifted the jurisdiction of Schiavo's case from state courts to federal courts.
Suggesting Shiavo's fate now rested with the courts, Bush said, "I have looked at all options prior to taking the action we took last weekend in concert with Congress ,And now we'll watch the courts make its decisions."
Shiavo's feeding tube was disconnected last Friday with state judge's approval, which led to the weekend effort by Congressional Republicans to push through the unprecedented emergency legislation.
Doctors have suggested Shiavo could survive one to two weeks without the feeding tube.
The Schindlers have vowed to appeal to the US Supreme Court, which refused to get involved previously.
Shiavo's husband has said she did not want to be kept alive artificially and has no hope for recovery, but her parents have contended that Schiavo's condition could improve with treatment.
Even some of the most ardent supporters of a seven year battle to keep Terri Schiavo alive began to resign themselves to what appeared inevitable Thursday: saying goodbye for the last time.
A string of courtroom defeats and bleak prospects for victory in further appeals left Schiavo's parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, with a fast shrinking field of options.
The couple watched Thursday as the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear their appeal and a Pinellas County judge blocked Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, R, from taking custody of the brain damaged woman to have her feeding tube reinserted.
The legal setbacks angered many of the protesters here and drew the largest crowds yet to demonstrations outside Schiavo's hospice, where the phrase "death watch" was repeated over and over.
Frustration spilled out on talk radio programs, with some callers asking for drastic and highly unlikely measures, including mobilizing the National Guard to seize Schiavo before she dies.
"Absent a kidnapping, Terri Schiavo is going to remain in the hospice," said George Felos, attorney for Schiavo's husband, Michael Schiavo, who says his wife would not want to live in her current condition.
"The entire judicial system of the United States state courts and entire federal court system has said this case must end.
This case is over."
Even as Felos was declaring a conclusion to the case, the governor pressed appeals that argue the state has authority to take custody of Schiavo to investigate abuse allegations and to consider a state medical report that says she may not be in a vegetative state.
But courts have consistently rejected previous appeals related to abuse allegations and new medical diagnoses.
The Schindlers' lawyers also were asking a federal judge in Tampa, who had ruled against them earlier this week, to consider additional legal arguments.
The frenetic maneuvers unspooled while supporters of keeping Schiavo alive decried the U.S. Supreme Court's decision early Thursday not to take the case.
"The president is saddened by the latest ruling," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Thursday morning.
As it became more apparent that Terri Schiavo may die soon, Michael Schiavo's legal team began to disclose plans for her burial.
The courts have rejected requests by the Schindlers to block Michael Schiavo from having her cremated.
The parents say cremation would violate the religious beliefs of their daughter, who was a practicing Catholic.
Felos said Schiavo would be cremated and buried in a plot owned by Michael Schiavo's family in Pennsylvania, where the couple grew up.
"All week my heart has been waiting for that angel to come in and save her again, just as it has in the past," Terri Schiavo's childhood friend Diane Meyer said in a halting, emotional voice during a phone interview from her home in Pennsylvania.
"But I know, eventually, if all their attempts just don't work out, I have to come to terms with it."
Some Catholics have marveled at the weighty symbolic possibility that Schiavo, 41, could die between Good Friday and Easter Sunday, the holiest period on the church's calendar.
"That's the kind of convergence no one could have planned," said Richard Doerflinger, an opponent of ending Schiavo's feeding and vice president of the Pro Life Secretariat of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.
"People will say, 'Terri Schiavo died for our sins in a society that does not care enough for the helpless.'
" The Schindler family spent the day shuttling between the Woodside Hospice and a small gift store across the street donated for their use by the owner.
The short walks inevitably turned into slow processions as camera crews and reporters crowded around the family and followed them until they reached a line of police guarding the one story brick and shingle hospice.
Randall Terry, the founder of the antiabortion group Operation Rescue who now works as a Christian activist, served as family spokesman, recounting the wrenching details of their bedside visits.
"She looked like she just came from Auschwitz," he said Schiavo's sister, Suzanne Vitadamo, told him after visiting Schiavo.
He told reporters that Mary Schindler became ill after leaning toward her daughter, who has been without food or hydration since Friday.
"It was as if Terri was begging her for help," he said.
The Schindlers have been insulated by as many as 30 family members, some of whom occasionally peered through the tinted windows of the gift shop's door.
Couches and chairs have been brought in to create an impromptu living room, where family members have sat chatting for hours to try to distract them from their grief, said Mary Schindler's brother, Mike Tammaro.
There is no television or radio, he said, only the constant chime of cell phones.
A parade of supportive celebrities has phoned the Schindlers, Tammaro said.
His sister or her husband have spoken with Mel Gibson, Pat Boone and "Everybody Loves Raymond" star Patricia Heaton.
Mary Schindler "is having a hard time realizing (Schiavo's) days are running out," Tammaro said, and has had trouble getting out of bed in the morning even though she is a lifelong early riser.
Tammaro, one of the few family members allowed to visit Schiavo, said he "laid hands" on her during a moment of prayer with several other family members this week.
"I felt her move to my touch," he said.
Schiavo, he said, often appears to laugh when someone tells a joke.
The Schindlers had been hoping that Gov. Bush could save their daughter by presenting an affidavit from William Cheshire, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla., who believes Schiavo may be in a "minimally conscious," rather than "vegetative," state, as court appointed doctors believe.
Cheshire has been vocal critic of assisted suicide.
An article attributed to him on the Web site restorationfoundation.org advocated Jews converting to Christianity.
"Should not we who are in Christ lift the yoke of persecution from the shoulders of the Jewish people and refresh them with the truth of the Lord of the Sabbath?" the article says.
Pinellas County Circuit Judge George Greer ruled that Bush's attempt to use Cheshire's report as a basis for taking custody of Schiavo appeared to be a violation of the constitutional separation of the legislative, judicial and executive branches.
"By clear and convincing evidence, it was determined she did not want to live under such burdensome conditions and that she would refuse such medical treatment assistance," Greer wrote.
Bush may have missed an opportunity to take custody of Schiavo on Thursday morning.
For about three hours, Felos said, there was no judicial impediment stopping the state from seizing Schiavo and resuming her tube feeding because an arcane rule granted an automatic stay of court orders after an appeal was filed at 8:15 a.m.
Realizing that the appeal opened a window of opportunity, Felos said, he asked Greer to issue another order nullifying the stay.
Once the state figured out what was happening, Felos said, its lawyers apparently tried to stall a Thursday morning hearing before Greer to give officers time to drive to the hospice.
But Greer issued the order shortly after 11 a.m., preventing any possible state action.
Another attempt to seize Schiavo may have been set in motion the day before, Felos said.
Law enforcement officers and an attorney for Morton Plant Hospital, where Schiavo's tube was to be reinserted, told Felos and his legal team that the governor's office had notified them that agents from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement were preparing to take custody of Schiavo and drive her to the hospital.
Those phone calls prompted Felos to ask Greer to issue the order that was handed down late Wednesday afternoon blocking the state from taking custody and authorizing "each and every" sheriff's deputy in the state to stop any attempt to remove Schiavo from the hospice.
The possible intervention of Bush briefly heartened the crowd outside the hospice.
But hope was fading late Thursday.
Unable to do anything else, a gray haired woman in a long black dress fell to her knees as the sky was darkening.
She clasped her hands and her lips moved, in silent prayer.

Judge George Greer of Pinellas Pasco Circuit Court, who nine days ago ordered the removal of the feeding tube keeping Terri Schiavo alive, on Saturday again rejected a motion from her parents seeking to have the tube reinserted.
Lawyers for the parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, said that they would appeal Greer's decision to the Florida Supreme Court, but would not pursue the case in federal courts.
They said they would also continue pressing political leaders, including President Bush and Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, to intervene further in the case.
But time, they said, had all but run out.
"She does not want to die," Robert Schindler said after a late morning visit to his daughter's bedside.
"She is fighting like hell to stay alive.
I want the powers that be to know that it is not too late to save her."
Gov. Bush, who has become a particular target of the protesters' scorn in recent days, has said that he has done all he can under the law.
Advisers to the family were openly hostile to him on Saturday.
"Gov. Bush has stopped taking our calls," said Randall Terry, a longtime anti abortion activist and an adviser to the Schindlers.
"But we have not given up hope for a miracle."
Meanwhile, protesters maintained their vigil outside the Woodside Hospice House where, in a room deep inside the complex, Schiavo edged closer to death.
The crowds were slightly smaller on Saturday than they had been earlier in the week, but the passions remained high.
Lawyers for the Schindlers argued in their motion filed late Friday before Greer that they had new evidence that Schiavo was more able to communicate than had previously been supposed, pointing to a meeting they said occurred on March 18 between the stricken woman and one of the lawyers.
At that time, they said, Schiavo made two vowel sounds, "Ahhh" and "Waaa," in response to a questioner who asked if she wanted to live.
They interpreted the sounds as an effort to say that she did indeed want to live.
Lawyers for Michael Schiavo, her husband, argued that it was already known that Terri Schiavo responded to some stimulations by making sounds, but the court had already ruled that this was merely a reflex, not an effort at communication.
In his tersely worded ruling, issued shortly after noon, Greer noted that the lawyers had waited a full week to mention the response to the courts, even though they had also appeared before an emergency hearing in federal court earlier in the week.
By failing to mention the incident at that earlier hearing, he ruled, they had given up the right to bring it up at all.
A U.S. federal appeals court early Wednesday agreed to consider a petition by Terri Schiavo's parents for a new hearing on whether to reconnect their severely brain damaged daughter's feeding tube.
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled without comment on Schiavo's 12th day without nourishment.
Last week, the same court twice ruled against Schiavo's parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, who are trying to keep her alive.
In seeking a new hearing late Tuesday, attorneys for Schiavo's parents argued that the District Court "committed plain error when it reviewed only the state court case and outcome history."
Now, the court will consider the request for a new hearing, rather than whether previous Florida court rulings have met legal standards under state law, which is what federal courts have done in the case until now.
Terri Schiavo's feeding tube was removed March 18 on a court order sought by her husband, Michael Schiavo, who contends she wouldn't want to be kept alive artificially.
Doctors have said Terri Schiavo, 41, would probably die within a week or two of the tube being removed.
She suffered catastrophic brain damage in 1990 when her heart stopped for several minutes because of a chemical imbalance apparently brought on by an eating disorder.
Bob Schindler described his daughter as "failing" following his visit Tuesday.
"She still looks pretty darn good under the circumstances," Schindler said.
"You can see the impact of no food and water for 12 days.
Her bodily functions are still working.
We still have her."
Federal courts were given jurisdiction to review Schiavo's case after Republicans in Congress pushed through unprecedented emergency legislation aimed at prolonging Schiavo's life.
But federal courts at two levels rebuffed the family.
Anita Fanshaw, 43, one of about 10 protesters outside Schiavo's hospice in Pinellas Park, Florida, praised Wednesday's court decision.
"God has a way of making things work," she said.
Attorneys for the Schindlers and Schiavo's husband didn't immediately return phone messages early Wednesday.
On Tuesday, the Rev. Jesse Jackson prayed with the Schindlers and joined conservatives in calling for state lawmakers to order her feeding tube reinserted.
The former Democratic presidential candidate was invited by Schiavo's parents to meet with activists outside Schiavo's hospice.
His arrival was greeted by some applause and cries of "This is about civil rights!"
"I feel so passionate about this injustice being done, how unnecessary it is to deny her a feeding tube, water, not even ice to be used for her parched lips," he said.
"This is a moral issue and it transcends politics and family disputes."
Mary Schindler later made a terse but emotional appeal to Michael Schiavo: "Michael and Jodi, you have your own children.
Please, please give my child back to me."
Michael Schiavo and fiancee Jodi Centonze have two children, born long after Terri Schiavo's collapse.
Although supporters of the Schindlers have claimed the dehydrated woman is being denied comfort measures such as ice chips for her dry mouth or balm for chapped lips, George Felos, the husband's attorney, defended how Schiavo is being cared for.
"Obviously, the parents and the siblings are desperate.
Desperation may lead to different perceptions," Felos told CNN.
"I can only tell you what I've seen, and Terri is dying a very peaceful, cared for death."
Jackson said he asked Michael Schiavo for permission to see the brain damaged woman but was denied.
He also telephoned black legislators in a last ditch effort to bring back a bill that would prohibit severely brain damaged patients from being denied food and water if they didn't express their wishes in writing.
Lawmakers rejected the legislation earlier this month and appeared unlikely to reconsider it.
First lady Laura Bush also commented on the case Tuesday, saying the government was right to have intervened on behalf of Schiavo.
"It is a life issue that really does require government to be involved," Bush said aboard a plane bound for Afghanistan, where she was to promote education and women's rights.
During Jackson's visit, a man was tackled to the ground by officers when he tried to storm into the hospice, police said.
He became the 47th protester arrested since the feeding tube was removed March 18.
The man had two bottles of water with him but did not reach the hospice door, police said.
The parents had lost a round in the courts Tuesday when an appeals court upheld a previous ruling by Judge George Greer that blocked the Department of Children and Families from intervening in the case.
Associated Press Writer Mike Schneider in Pinellas Park, Florida, contributed to this report.
The fate of Terri Schiavo landed in federal court Monday, as a judge here struggled to weigh the complex facts and assertions amid pleas from Schiavo's parents to act to resume her feeding before time ran out.
After two hours of tense and often emotional arguments, Judge James D. Whittemore of U.S. District Court refused to rule immediately on whether to restore nutrition to Schiavo, a severely brain damaged woman whose husband won a state court's permission to remove her feeding tube last Friday.
Whittemore also expressed doubts about whether a federal review could change the ultimate outcome and seemed skeptical of the parents' contention that the state courts had violated Schiavo's right to due process.
The delay disappointed Schiavo's parents and others who have asked the federal court to swiftly order the tube reinserted and halt Schiavo's demise.
Whittemore, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton in 1999, was randomly selected by computer to preside over the case after Congress passed an extraordinary law early Monday morning allowing Schiavo's parents to seek a federal court review of the facts.
While their lawyer said that Schiavo, who had already gone more than three days without food or water, "may expire as I speak," Whittemore appeared to be taking the calculated risk that she would survive while he deliberated.
Doctors have said that Schiavo, 41, could live up to two weeks without the feeding tube.
The hearing on Monday was the result of a determined effort by the Republican leadership in Congress to override a series of state court rulings that sided with Schiavo's husband, Michael.
President Bush returned to the White House from his vacation in Texas solely to sign the law.
He later praised Congress for "voting to give Terry Schiavo's parents another opportunity to save their daughter's life."
During the hearing in Tampa, the chief lawyer for Schiavo's parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, told Whittemore that Schiavo's due process rights had been violated because she had not had independent legal representation during the seven years the case was in state courts.
The lawyer, David Gibbs, also said Schiavo's religious beliefs as a Roman Catholic were being infringed because Pope John Paul II has deemed it unacceptable for Catholics to refuse food and water.
"We are now in a position where a court has ordered her to disobey her church and even jeopardize her eternal soul," Gibbs said.
George Felos, who represents Michael Schiavo, who is also her guardian, said reinserting the feeding tube would "countenance a severe invasion upon the body of Terri Schiavo" and he asked the judge to declare that the law passed by Congress was unconstitutional.
Whittemore frequently sighed, paused and buried his face in his hands during the hearing.
He wanted details of how long it would take to move Schiavo from her hospice to a nearby hospital and replace the tube about two hours, the lawyers said and what the procedure involved.
Each side said it would require surgery and that Schiavo would need to be hospitalized for several days while her electrolyte balance was restored.
Schiavo's husband and parents, once close, have battled over her fate since 1998, when the husband asked a state court's permission to remove life support.
Terri Schiavo suffered extensive brain damage when her heart stopped beating one night in 1990, apparently caused by a potassium deficiency that may have been caused by an eating disorder.
She can breathe on her own and has periods of wakefulness, but Judge George Greer of Pinellas Pasco Circuit Court, who presided over the case, accepted the testimony of doctors who said she was in a "persistent vegetative state" and incapable of thought or emotion.
More important, Greer found credible Michael Schiavo's testimony that his wife, who left no written directive, had said on several occasions that she would not want life prolonging measures to be used for her.
Whittemore frequently interjected questions, pressing Gibbs about his claim that Greer had violated Schiavo's due process rights that he had not given her a fair trial.
Whittemore pointed out that Greer had held a "lengthy" trial and had appointed several independent "guardians ad litem" to represent Terri Schiavo's interests, and that her parents had represented her interests, as they saw them, by fighting the tube removal.
Whittemore asked Gibbs to cite case law that would bolster the claim that Schiavo's 14th Amendment rights to due process had been violated, adding, "because we haven't found any."
Without proof that the state court's handling of the case violated precedent, Whittemore said, "I think you would be hard pressed to convince me that you have substantial likelihood" of succeeding on the merits of the case.
Gibbs promised to provide case law backing up his claims as soon as possible.
But he also said that under the new law passed by Congress, the federal court should "not unduly trouble itself with the history" of the case in state court.
Gibbs is seeking a new trial with a jury, which was lacking in the 2000 trial held by Greer.
But when Gibbs said that Greer's findings were irrelevant under the congressional measure, Whittemore replied, "That's not how I read the act." Felos, representing Michael Schiavo, sought to focus Whittemore on the question of the constitutionality of the congressional act passed in the early morning hours.
He argued that Congress did not have the authority to allow a federal review of the case because the Constitution says it is up to a state to decide whether due process rights have been violated.
"Yes, life is sacred," Felos said, "but so is liberty, your honor, especially in this country."
Robert Schindler, who attended the hearing without his wife, left the courthouse looking grim.
Outside, protesters supporting the Schindlers heckled Felos as he told reporters he felt optimistic about the case.
Gibbs told reporters he was not discouraged by the judge's refusal to rule from the bench.
"His reputation is one that is very careful, he is very methodical," he said, though he added, "Every moment is precious."
In Tallahassee, Gov. Jeb Bush said he was grateful to Congress for passing a law but said he still wanted the Florida Legislature to pass a measure tightening the requirements for guardianship.
Michael Schiavo lives with a girlfriend with whom he has had two children, and the governor said that presented a conflict of interest.
"I think our state ought to change our laws to say in those circumstances, that that guardian needs to be changed," Bush said.
Terri Schiavo, the severely brain damaged Florida woman who became the subject of an intense legal and political battle that drew responses from the White House to the Halls of Congress to the Vatican, died Thursday, 13 days after her feeding tube was removed on the order of a state court judge.
Schiavo, 41, died just before 10 a.m. Thursday in the Pinellas Park hospice where she had lived, off and on, for several years, her parents' attorney said.
But even as she died, the searing emotions that surrounded her final days remained, following a national debate over whether she should have been reconnected to a tube that provided her with nourishment and hydration.
The lawyer, David Gibbs, said Schiavo's brother and sister were with Schiavo until just before she died.
"While they are heartsick, this is indeed a sad day for the nation, this is a sad day for the family," Gibbs said.
"Their faith in God remains consistent and strong.
They are absolutely convinced that God loves Terri more than they do.
They believe that Terri is now ultimately at peace with God himself.
"They intend to comfort themselves with their faith and with their family at this time."
CNN reported that Schiavo's husband, Michael, was with her when she died.
Her parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, came to the hospice shortly after they learned of her death and prayed at her bedside, said Brother Paul O'Donnell, a Franciscan Friar who has served as a spokesman for the parents.
They left shortly thereafter.
As word of her death spread through the crowd outside the hospice, some people sang hymns, others began praying.
Shortly after Schiavo died, her body was transported to the medical examiner's office, where an autopsy will be performed, at her husband's request.
Just before noon, President Bush said he was saddened to hear of Schiavo's death.
"I urge all those who honor Terri Schiavo to continue to work to build a culture of life, where all Americans are welcomed and valued and protected," the president said, "especially those who live at the mercy of others.
"The essence of civilization is that the strong have a duty to protect the weak.
In cases where there are serious doubts and questions, the presumption should be in the favor of life."
Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, who had tried to intervene in the matter several times to keep Schiavo connected to her feeding tube, said after learning of her death that "this issue transcends politics and policies."
He also called this "the toughest issue" in his tenure.
"Her experience will heighten awareness of the importance of families dealing with end of life issues, and that is an incredible legacy," he said.
"The politics takes care of itself.
"As a society, as we live longer, it's important for us to deal with these issues.
I wish I could have done more.
That's the sadness in my heart."
The fight between Schiavo's husband to have his wife's feeding tube removed, saying he was fulfilling her wish not to live in a vegetative state, and her parents, who said she could still recover if she was given proper treatment, lasted seven years and made its way from the state courts to the Supreme Court, and back again, several times.
On Wednesday night, the Supreme Court refused, for the sixth time, to intervene in the matter.
The family's dispute also resulted in a new state law in Florida and an emergency session of the House of Representatives that produced a new federal law signed by President Bush in the early hours of the morning of March 21.
A range of judges consistently sided with Michael Schiavo, but her parents would not give up, going from court to court and appealing to politicians and to people who believed that removing the tube was tantamount to taking a life.
"Not only has Mrs Schiavo's case been given due process, but few, if any similar cases have ever been afforded this heightened level of process," Chief Judge Chris Altenbernd, of the 2nd Court of Appeal in Florida, wrote earlier this month.
The legal fight provoked a great national discussion, with polls showing most people did not believe politicians should be involved in personal issues of one family trying to decide whether a family member should be kept alive.
But it also provoked a great outcry among an ad hoc coalition of Catholic and evangelical lobbyists, street organizers and legal advisers, some of whom demonstrated outside the hospice in recent days, and picketed outside the homes of Michael Schiavo and Judge George W. Greer of Pinellas Pasco Circuit Court, who originally ordered the tube removed.
Snippets of a video tape the Schindlers made of their daughter three years ago in which she appears to be smiling, grunting and moaning in response to her mother's voice, and to follow a balloon with her eyes, has become ingrained in the national consciousness after being replayed on news channels over and over again.
Theresa Marie Schiavo was born Dec 3, 1963, and grew up in Huntingdon Valley, Pa.
She was the oldest child of Robert and Mary Schindler, a shy, sensitive girl who loved animals, John Denver and "Starsky and Hutch."
She struggled with her weight but lost more than 50 pounds in her senior year of high school.
The newly thin Terri Schindler met Michael Schiavo in her second semester at Bucks County Community College.
He was her first and only boyfriend.
They became engaged after five months of dating and married in 1984 in a large, formal Roman Catholic wedding ceremony.
Within two years the couple moved to St. Petersburg, Fla., where he worked as a restaurant manager and she as an insurance company clerk.
The Schindlers shortly followed with their younger children, Bobby and Suzanne, and Schiavo continued her close relationship with her family while her husband worked nights.
She also grew even thinner and had no luck becoming pregnant even after she consulted a fertility specialist.
She weighed no more than 110 pounds on Feb 26, 1990, the day her ordinary life changed irrevocably.
Michael Schiavo said he heard a thud about 4 a.m. and rose from bed to find his wife collapsed on the floor.
By the time paramedics arrived and resuscitated her, oxygen depletion had caused grievous brain damage.
Doctors said her heart had stopped because of an undiagnosed potassium deficiency, possibly a result of bulimia.
They said she had lapsed into a persistent vegetative state, meaning she could breathe on her own and had periods of wakefulness, but was incapable of thought, memory or emotion.
Mr Schiavo tried for several years to rehabilitate his wife, even taking her to California for an experimental brain treatment, but nothing worked.
He filed a malpractice suit against the obstetrician who had overseen Schiavo's fertility therapy, contending that the potassium deficiency should have been detected.
In January 1993, the couple was awarded $750000 in economic damages for her and $300000 for loss of companionship for him.
A month later, on Valentine's Day, both the Schindlers and Schiavo say, a fight over the award signaled the beginning of their estrangement.
The way Mr Schiavo has described it, he was visiting his wife when the Schindlers walked in and Mr Schindler asked how much money he would receive from Mr Schiavo's part of the malpractice settlement.
The Schindlers say the fight was about what treatment their daughter's money would go toward, with the Schindlers advocating rigorous therapy and Mr Schiavo wanting basic care.
As the rift deepened, Mr Schiavo's hopes for his wife's recovery apparently evaporated.
In 1994, court records show, he decided not to have her treated for a urinary tract infection, a move prompted, he later testified, by her doctor's advice.
In 1998 Mr Schiavo petitioned the local probate court for permission to remove his wife's feeding tube, a move the Schindlers immediately challenged.
In 2000, Judge George W. Greer of Pinellas Pasco Circuit Court gave Mr Schiavo permission to remove his wife's feeding tube after a monthlong trial in which Mr Schiavo and two of his relatives testified that on several occasions, Schiavo had told them she would not want to be kept alive artificially.
Schiavo's feeding tube was first removed in April 2001, but was reinserted after only two days so that her parents could present new evidence.
The case first drew national attention in October 2003, when Greer ordered the tube removed a second time.
After six days, Governor Bush and the state legislature intervened.
The legislature rushed through a law empowering Gov. Bush to order the tube reinserted, overriding years of court rulings and infuriating Mr Schiavo, who sued on grounds that the measure was unconstitutional.
The Florida Supreme Court agreed with him and knocked down the law, but it prolonged the case, and Schiavo's life, for well over a year.
Last month, Greer ordered that Schiavo's feeding tube be removed for the third and final time on March 18.
But with her parents stepping up their fight, even President Bush and Congress tried to avert her death with an unprecedented law that let the Schindlers take their case to a federal court.
In a series of events, Congress passed the measure on March 21 just after midnight, less than three days after doctors removed the tube as protesters gathered outside Schiavo's hospice.
President Bush, who had rushed back to Washington from his Texas ranch to sign it, did so in the middle of the night.
Its backers hoped that the law would lead a federal court to quickly order Schiavo's feeding tube reinserted, at least giving her parents more time to press their case.
But one court after another turned down the parents, with the latest defeat coming Wednesday night, when the Supreme Court again refused to take up the matter.
Her parents, devout Catholics, even attracted the attention of the Vatican.
Last year, they filed a motion to set aside the judge's authorization to remove the feeding tube, pointing to Pope John Paul II's statement in the spring that it was wrong to withhold food and water from people in vegetative states.
The Vatican, which typically stays out of local affairs, has recently been pointed about Schiavo.
On March 21, the Vatican's official newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, said: "Who can judge the dignity and sacredness of the life of a human being, made in the image and likeness of God?
Who can decide to pull the plug as if we were talking about a broken or out of order household appliance?"
Thursday, after hearing of her death, Cardinal Jose Saraiva Martins, head of the Vatican's office for sainthood, told reporters that pulling Schiavo's feeding tube had been "an attack against God," The Associated Press said.
As expected, Florida lawmakers refused to intervene Wednesday in the case of severely brain damaged Terri Schiavo, despite eleventh hour lobbying by her brother and mounting pressure from Christian conservatives and anti abortion groups.
"The Senate spoke, and that's it," said Sen Daniel Webster, the Republican who unsuccessfully shepherded a measure to keep the 41 year old woman alive.
The three hour emotional debate by nearly half of the Senate's 40 senators included personal anecdotes, readings from Scripture and vociferous objections by those who voted against the measure and were subsequently targeted by hate mail, vitriolic telephone calls and whose offices were even invaded by irate Schindler family supporters.
"I am not pulling the plug on her to take away her life.
No one in this room is.
But what we could do today ,might arguably delay her death," said Sen Rod Smith, (D).
Doing so, he said, would be the "cruelest fate."
"The worst thing in my view is not to release one's soul to peace when that person has declared that's what they want," said Smith, the only gubernatorial candidate with a vote on the measure.
He cast his vote with the majority that voted 21 18 against Webster's bill Wednesday.
Last week, the same 21 voted against a different version of the proposal.
Webster began the debate by excoriating the "Republican nine," a bloc of senators who joined with 12 Democrats to successfully kill an amendment to the measure last week, and who stuck together Wednesday.
But Sen Jim King, the Republican who was Senate president when lawmakers approved "Terri's law" in 2003, defended last week's vote.
"We were being asked to make a bill that we had absolutely no interest in passing at all, ever, better.
For those of us with our view, why would we ever want to do that?" queried King, who called "Terri's law" the biggest regret of his lengthy legislative career.
The day unfolded as Schiavo's brother, Bobby Schindler, walked the Senate halls while dozens of protestors lined the walls of the four story building where lawmakers' offices are located, kneeling or carrying signs saying "We are begging for Terri's life."
Early on, Schindler's efforts were rebuffed by several senators, some of whom barricaded themselves inside their offices.
One aide asked Senate security to remove Schindler and his escort, anti abortion activist Carole Griffin.
Even Schindler once appeared dismayed by the intimidating presence of his sister's supporters, some of whom traveled from across the nation to maintain a vigil that shifted from the Capitol to the governor's mansion to and the hospice where Terri Schiavo lay.
"I'm afraid they'll do more harm than good," he whispered to Griffin.
Senators echoed the thought during the debate Wednesday.
"I never thought I would have people who refer to themselves as Christians walk across my door and say some of the mean things that they've said about people in this building," said Sen Larcenia Bullard, (D), a Baptist.
Bullard asked the people trying to sway her vote to "stop playing God and refer back to the Bible."
During the senate debate, Bush held a hastily planned press conference in his usual press conference room announcing DCF's plans to take emergency action to "stabilize" Schiavo.
Pinellas Circuit Judge George Greer later issued an injunction keeping DCF and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement away from Schiavo.
Senator Dennis Jones, (R), said Bush's push to get DCF involved is an abuse of power.
"I think it's illegal," Jones said.
"I think the message has been said.
We need to let death with dignity take its course and quit ,grandstanding."
Several dozen sign clutching demonstrators organized by Randall Terry, an anti abortion activist and founder of Operation Rescue, crashed the press conference.
All but three of the protestors left after a security guard announced that only credentialed press would be allowed to stay.
The last three retreated after Terry motioned them out of the room.

The U.S. Supreme Court refused on Monday to step in and keep a severely brain damaged woman hooked to a feeding tube, all but ending a long running right to die battle pitting her husband against her parents.
It was the second time the Supreme Court dodged the politically charged case from Florida, where Republican Gov. Jeb Bush successfully lobbied the Legislature to pass a law to keep 41 year old Terri Schiavo on life support.
The decision was criticized as "judicial homicide" by Mrs Schiavo's father, Robert Schindler, but applauded by her husband, Michael Schiavo, who contends his wife never wanted to be kept alive artificially.
The court's action is very narrow, affecting only Schiavo.
More broadly, sometime after returning from their winter break, the justices will consider the Bush administration's request to block the nation's only law allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients die more quickly.
Oregon voters passed that law in 1998, and more states could follow if justices find that the federal government cannot punish doctors who prescribed lethal doses of federally controlled drugs.
Terri Schiavo was 26 when she suffered brain damage in 1990 after her heart temporarily stopped beating because of an eating disorder.
Most of the legal wrangling in the case has involved whether she is in a persistent vegetative state with no chance of recovery and whether her husband has a conflict of interest because he lives with another woman and has two children with her.
The legal battle between Mrs Schiavo's husband and parents began in 1993 and appeared to reach its climax in 2003 when Michael Schiavo won a court decision ordering that the feeding tube be removed.
But it was reinserted six days later, after the Legislature passed "Terri's Law."
The Florida Supreme Court ruled that the law was an unconstitutional effort to override court rulings.
The nation's high court refused without comment to disturb that decision.
"It's judicial homicide.
They want to murder her," Schindler said.
"I have no idea what the next step will be.
We're going to fight for her as much as we can fight for her.
She deserves a chance."
George Felos, the attorney for Michael Schiavo, said his client will have his wife's feeding tube removed as soon as pending appeals are over and a stay is lifted.
"You've got to look at it from his perspective he's a citizen living in Clearwater (Florida) and up against the weight of the governor and Legislature of the state of Florida a governor whose brother is president of the United States.
That was a very, very difficult and imposing fight.
He was very relieved that the rule of law prevailed," Felos said.
With the clock running down on how much longer Terri Schiavo can remain alive, congressional leaders Saturday announced an unprecedented agreement that would allow Schiavo's parents to petition the federal courts to have a feeding tube replaced for their brain damaged daughter.
The agreement, which involves emergency weekend sessions of both the House and Senate, marks the first time Congress has intervened directly in an individual right to die case.
The announcement came in dramatic fashion, trumpeted by conservative Republican leaders who persuaded Democrats to agree to the measure as long as it pertained only to the 41 year old Florida woman and did not open the way for moving other such emotionally charged cases into the federal courts.
The White House announced Saturday night that President Bush would fly to Washington from his Texas ranch Sunday to sign the emergency legislation.
Press secretary Scott McClellan said the president was standing with "all those" working to save Schiavo's life.
Outside the nursing facility in Florida where Schiavo is being cared for, her mother had pleaded earlier Saturday for lawmakers and the president to intervene.
"Please, please, please save my little girl," said Mary Schindler.
A vigil was kept at the facility in Pinellas Park, three people were arrested when they tried to enter the hospice.
Schiavo's husband, Michael, who has fought to have her feeding tube removed, said Congress was "getting into something they know nothing about."
"And it's sad," he said.
"If they can do it to me, they can do it to everyone in this country."
Terri Schiavo's case has become a cause celebre for evangelical Christians, who have opposed efforts by her husband to end the medical measures that have kept her alive for the past 15 years.
Schiavo suffered severe neurological damage as a result of a heart attack.
Schiavo's case, which raises difficult issues of assisted suicide and right to life, has been championed by conservatives and evangelical Christians, who turned to congressional Republicans for help after a Florida court ordered the feeding tube removed last Friday.
Democrats kept a low profile on the issue, but some quietly cooperated with GOP leaders in the back stage negotiations this weekend.
Essentially, the Democrats agreed to allow the Republicans to move forward with a series of elaborate and unusual parliamentary maneuvers ending in action on the narrowly drawn legislation.
The Senate, meeting Saturday evening, passed a special adjournment resolution that opened the way for the House and Senate to meet in emergency session Sunday and take up legislation allowing federal courts to consider accepting jurisdiction in the case.
Until now, it has been in the hands of Florida state courts, which have supported Schiavo's husband.
If a federal judge should decide to accept the case, a court order could be issued to reinstall the feeding tube while the matter was under consideration.
The House is poised to consider the measure Sunday under a unanimous consent rule.
If that fails, it will take up the measure again at 12:01 a.m. Monday by suspending the House's regular calendar and voting on the measure by voice acclamation, Republican leaders said.
The Senate would act soon afterward, sending the measure to President Bush for his signature.
The White House has indicated Bush would sign it.
Few members of Congress are likely to be on hand for these votes, since most have already begun their Easter recess.
But in this case, only a majority of members present and voting is needed for approval.
The fast moving legislative timetable may raise the curtain on an equally dramatic legal gambit.
Schiavo's parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, would presumably to turn to the U.S. Court for the Middle District of Florida and ask a federal judge to keep their daughter alive against her husband's wishes.
Assuming they file the petition sometime Monday, Schiavo who is physically incapable of feeding herself or accepting food by mouth will already have gone three days without sustenance in the form of fluids and nutrition.
Medical experts say a human being generally can live only about seven days without fluids.
Give the high emotions aroused by the case, any legal action by the parents in federal court almost certainly would be challenged by Michael Schiavo.
The result could be legal skirmishes and appeals eventually reaching all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.
But the congressional action alone marked a clear victory for Schiavo's parents, as well as for their supporters, religious groups and the conservative wing of the Republican majority in Congress.
It turned what had been a largely local and personal struggle over one woman's right to live or die into a high stakes Washington political issue with highly charged religious and moral overtones.
"We are confident this compromise addresses everyone's concerns," said House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R Texas, who has taken the lead in championing the parents' cause.
"We are confident it will provide Mrs Schiavo a clear and appropriate avenue for appeal in federal court, and most importantly, we are confident this compromise will restore nutrition and hydration to Mrs Schiavo as long as that appeal endures."
Democratic Rep James Oberstar of Minnesota worked with his Republican counterparts in putting together the measure titled: "Relief of the Parents of Theresa Marie Schiavo."
He encouraged his Democratic colleagues to approve the bill because it is "carefully crafted and narrowly targeted" for the sole use of Schiavo's father and mother.
"The legislation does no harm," he said, "while the longer term legal matter is resolved."
Not all Democrats saw it that way.
Rep Robert Wexler, D Fla., said it was "unconscionable that Congress has decided to continue to intercede."
He added that he will object to the unanimous consent proposal in the House on Sunday, which could delay action until just after midnight Monday.
Schiavo's husband has pursued the effort to end his wife's life because, he has said, while she left no written, living will, she had made it clear to him before the heart attack occurred that she would never want to be kept alive in such a dire medical condition.
Her parents have fought tirelessly to keep her on life support, even to the point of asking her husband to relinquish to them his position as her legal guardian since he has become involved with another woman and has fathered children of his own.
The proposed legislation says that the Middle District of Florida "shall have jurisdiction to hear, determine and render judgment" on a petition from the parents "relating to the withholding or withdrawal of food, fluids, or medical treatment necessary to sustain (Terri Schiavo's) life."
It adds that "any parent of Theresa Marie Schiavo shall have standing to bring a suit under this act" into the federal courts.
It also makes clear that "nothing in this act shall constitute a precedent with respect to future legislation" and that it shall have "no effect" on other families faced with assisted suicide situations.
DeLay, in announcing the compromise, stressed that the clock is Terri Schiavo's greatest enemy.
"The longer we wait, the worse dehydrated she will get," he said.
"Most people need to understand she will not die of starvation.
She will die of dehydration, and that takes no more than seven days and the longer you go without fluids, the more possible that infections set in.
"And once infections set in it will spread throughout the body like wildfire.
I've had doctors tell me that.
That's why we're expediting this as fast as we can do it so we can get that feeding tube back in."
DeLay, who for days has been personally chastising Michael Schiavo, did not spare him on Saturday either.
"I don't have a whole lot of respect for a man that has treated this woman in this way," he said.
"What kind of man is he?"
Michael Schiavo said he felt like the government had just trampled all over his personal life.
"It's just incomprehensible that a government can walk all over somebody's private judicial matter because of their own personal feelings," Schiavo said on CNN's "Larry King Live."

A judge extended an order keeping brain damaged Terri Schiavo's feeding tube in place, saying he needed time to decide whether her parents should be allowed to pursue further efforts to keep her husband from removing her life support.
State Circuit Court Judge George Greer extended until 5 p.m. Friday an emergency stay that was to expire Wednesday afternoon.
He said he needs to decide whether her parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, can have more time to determine if she has greater mental capabilities than previously thought.
The Schindlers also are seeking to have her husband, Michael Schiavo, removed as her legal guardian.
"We are really elated," Robert Schindler said.
"Forty eight hours to us right now seems like six years."
Terri Schiavo's parents have been in a long, bitter struggle with her husband, Michael Schiavo, to keep her alive.
She collapsed 15 years ago Friday, when a chemical imbalance caused her heart to stop beating and cut off oxygen to her brain.
On Tuesday, an appeals court allowed a stay to expire that had been the last obstacle keeping Michael Schiavo from removing his wife's feeding tube.
Greer, however, issued his emergency stay later that day.
The Florida Department of Children & Families moved to intervene in the case Wednesday, hours after Gov. Jeb Bush told reporters he was seeking a way to keep Terri Schiavo alive.
Details of DCF's involvement in the case were not immediately available and both the governor's office and the agency declined comment.
Greer denied a DCF attorney an opportunity to speak at the afternoon hearing.
A court filing by the agency remained sealed, but attorneys for Schiavo's husband and her parents said it was related to allegations Michael Schiavo abused his wife.
Those allegations, which have been raised before, are based partly on bone scans showing Terri Schiavo suffered fractures and statements she made to family and friends that she was unhappy in her marriage.
Michael Schiavo has denied harming his wife.
George Felos, who represents Michael Schiavo, said DCF has already investigated the allegations and ruled them unfounded.
He criticized the DCF move, saying it "reeks of the intervention of politics into the case."
Some doctors have testified that Terri Schiavo is in a persistent vegetative state with no hope for recovery, but the Schindlers have countered with other medical opinions that she might improve with rehabilitation.
The 41 year old woman appears to cry, laugh and react to her family.
With the Schindlers' previous legal appeals exhausted, Michael Schiavo had planned to remove his wife's feeding tube Monday.
Doctors have said she would live no more than a week or two without getting food and water through the tube inserted into her abdomen.
Bush said Wednesday he was exploring options to block the removal of the tube.
"I can assure you, I will do whatever I can within the means, within the laws, of our state to protect this woman's life," Bush said, adding that he has received thousands of e mails and telephone calls from the Schindlers' supporters.
In October 2003, Schiavo went without food or water for six days before Bush pushed through a law letting him order reinsertion of the tube.
The Florida Supreme Court later struck down his action as unconstitutional.
The tube was also removed for two days in 2001.
Michael Schiavo said his wife never wanted to be kept alive artificially, but she left no written directive.
The Schindlers dispute their daughter had such wishes.
Fifteen years to the day after Terri Schiavo suffered severe brain damage, leaving her in a persistent vegetative state, a judge on Friday ordered that the feeding tube keeping her alive be removed in three weeks.
According to Pinellas Circuit Judge George W. Greer's instructions, Schiavo's husband, Michael, should disconnect the tube at 1 p.m. on March 18.
Schiavo contends that his wife did not want to live through artificial means.
But her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, argue that their daughter could improve with therapy.
Their lawyer said Friday that they would appeal Greer's order.
Earlier this week, the judge issued two brief stays barring Michael Schaivo from having his 41 year old wife's food and water halted.
But on Friday, Greer refused to further block his original order, issued in February 2000, that the tube be taken out.
"The court is no longer comfortable granting stays simply upon the filing of new motions and petitions, since there will always be 'new issues' that can be pled," the judge said.
Over the next three weeks, Greer said, Schiavo's parents "will need to demonstrate before the appellate courts that their requests have merit and are worthy of a stay."
Standing in an afternoon rain outside the hospice here where his daughter is being cared for, Bob Schindler said: "There are so many legal issues to argue.
I'm afraid we don't have the time."
Michael Schiavo expressed satisfaction that his in laws' request for another stay had been rejected.
"I am very pleased that the court has recognized there must be a finality to this process," Schiavo said in a statement released by his attorney, George J. Felos said.
"I am hopeful and confident that the appellate court will also agree that Terri's wishes not to be kept alive artificially must now be enforced."
On Feb 25, 1990, Terri Schiavo collapsed from what doctors later said was a potassium imbalance.
She left no living will or written instructions on what treatment she desired if she were to become incapacitated the reason for the protracted legal battle between her husband and parents.
David C. Gibbs III, the Schindlers' attorney, said he would be in Greer's office early Monday.
He said he would appeal the judge's denial of an extended stay, he also planned to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on the grounds that Terri Schiavo a Roman Catholic would not wish to be deprived of food and water in accordance with the latest papal teachings on how to care for the incapacitated.
Gibbs said he would seek to have a lawyer appointed for Terri Schiavo.
All the time that her fate has been pondered by the courts, he said, she has never had the benefit of legal representation which he termed a denial of her due process rights.
"I believe if Ted Bundy got a lawyer, Terri Schiavo should get a lawyer," Gibbs said, referring to the notorious serial killer executed in Florida.
A Florida appeals court Tuesday cleared the way for a brain damaged woman to be taken off her life support, but a lower court blocked implementation of the decision pending a further hearing.
The decisions were the latest in a lenghty legal battle between Terri Schiavo's husband, who wants to remove the feeding tube that has been keeping the 41 year old alive for 15 years, and her parents who want to prevent what they term "cold blooded murder."
Florida's Second District Court of Appeal on Tuesday formally issued the decision that effectively allows Michael Shiavo to have the life support tubes removed.
But Pinellas County Judge George Greer immediately suspended enforcement of the decision until Wednesday, when he is due to consider a request to extend a previously imposed stay.
Doctors have said that Schiavo has been in a persistent vegetative state for the last 15 years after suffering a heart attack and has no hope of recovering.
But her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler say she could recover if given the proper treatment.
They are backed by Florida Governor Jeb Bush, a brother of the US President.
The administration of Gov. Jeb Bush, already forcefully rebuked by Florida's supreme court for trying to override judicial orders and block the removal of a brain damaged woman's feeding tubes, launched itself back into the case on Wednesday by asking for a delay to investigate abuse allegations.
The surprise request by Florida's Department of Children and Families to intervene in the case of Terri Schiavo stirred an already emotional atmosphere.
A woman broke with courtroom decorum and called out "Amen" when an attorney for Schiavo's parents, who are trying to stop her husband from removing the feeding tube, announced in Pinellas County Circuit Court that the department has asked for a delay.
"We have been complaining and complaining and complaining that Terri has been abused, and it's fallen on deaf ears," Schiavo's father, Robert Schindler, said after the court hearing.
The legal maneuver adds a new layer of complication to the seven year case, which has drawn an eclectic mix of monks, antiabortion activists and conservative Christian activists to this town west of Tampa.
George Felos, the lead attorney for Schiavo's husband, Michael Schiavo, said the maneuver "reeks of political arm twisting."
"The governor and the Legislature the politicians have tried to do an end run around the court system."
In the past few years, Felos said, "scores" of abuse allegations from anonymous tipsters have been proven untrue.
While the case is slogging through the courts, its political aspects have been omnipresent.
It has been a hot topic among legislators in Tallahassee, and after Wednesday's hearing, Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry said he and others are working with Florida lawmakers to speed passage of a law that would strip Schiavo's husband of his authority as guardian because he now lives with another woman.
In 2003, Bush was criticized by bioethicists and constitutional scholars for pushing a law through the Florida Legislature that gave him the right to stop Michael Schiavo from removing the feeding tubes that have kept his wife alive since she collapsed 15 years ago.
The Florida Supreme Court said Bush "violated a cornerstone of American democracy."
The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from Bush.
On Wednesday, the governor told reporters that "I can assure you, I will do whatever I can within the means, within the laws, of our state to protect this woman's life."
A Bush spokesman said the governor, who appoints the head of the children and families department, did not ask the agency to enter the case.
The agency's request was sealed, making it impossible to assess the move, said Elizabeth Foley, a Florida International University law professor who teaches bioethics.
"Who the heck knows?"
Foley said.
"The state has an unqualified interest in preserving life ,but if it's the 'same 'ol, same 'ol,' it does seem like the executive branch is trying to circumvent the judiciary."
Amidst the uproar over the abuse investigation, the oft delayed case was delayed again on Wednesday to give Pinellas County Circuit Court Judge George Greer, who had already issued a 1 day stay this week, until Friday to consider a request for an indefinite stay.
Before the back to back delays, Schiavo's husband had said he would order doctors to remove her feeding tubes on Wednesday as soon as another stay that had been in place expired.
Attorneys for the Schindlers have raised half a dozen legal issues that they say must be resolved before a decision about pulling the feeding tubes.
Among them are arguments that Michael Schiavo should be removed as guardian, that Pope John Paul II's labeling of euthanasia as "a sin" should be weighed by the courts because Terri Schiavo was a practicing Catholic and that new scientific developments suggest she might be "minimally conscious," rather than in a vegetative state.
Felos argued that the case has been resolved since an order allowing the feeding tube removal in 2000 and that the Schindlers' attorneys are concocting legal arguments merely to get more delays.
Terri Schiavo's cerebral cortex, Felos said, is now "a giant black hole."
Special correspondent Catharine Skipp in Miami contributed to this report.
Florida's Governor Jeb Bush on Wednesday asked the US Supreme Court to intervene to keep a comatose woman alive, over the wishes of her husband, who wants to disconnect the feeding tube that has sustained her for 14 years.
Florida's state Supreme Court has already issued a ruling that cleared the way to remove Terri Schiavo's feeding tube, striking down a law Bush had pushed through the state legislature to reinsert the tube after her husband had had it taken out.
In his appeal, Bush claims the Florida ruling was invalid because Schiavo did not have an independent legal guardian in the case to advocate for her interests, said the governor's lawyer, Ken Connor.
Her husband, Michael Schiavo, and her parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, have conflicts of interest that prevent them from fairly deciding whether to keep her alive, Connor told AFP.
"Terri Schiavo's husband and guardian, had financial and personal conflicts of interest that made it impossible for him adequately to protect her interests," the filing said.
"Terri Schiavo had never been adequately represented at any point during the substituted judgment trial," it said.
Doctors say that Schiavo has been in a persistent vegetative state for the last 14 years since suffering a heart attack, and has no hope of recovering.
Her husband has fought for legal permission to remove a feeding tube in Terri's stomach.
The woman's parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, want to keep the feeding tube inserted so as to keep up the supply of nutrients and vitamins to their comatose daughter.
Removal of the tube would result in Terri Schiavo's death.
The Florida Legislature passed the so called "Terri's law" in October 2003, allowing for the reinsertion of the feeding tube after lower courts ruled to remove it.
Bush, the brother of President George W. Bush, opposes euthanasia and has fought to keep Schiavo alive.
In one of the fiercest life and death battles in the United States, the state House in Florida passed a bill Thursday to extend life support for a brain damaged woman.
The bill would block the removal of the feeding tube that has kept Terri Schiavo, 41, alive for the past 15 years.
A Florida appeals court has authorized the removal, which is scheduled on Friday.
Schiavo's husband and legal guardian Michael Schiavo has engaged in a seven year court battle with her parents.
Schiavo has urged the removal of the feeding tube, saying his wife would rather die in her condition, and her parents insisted that Schiavo be kept alive.
Some doctors have testified that Terri Schiavo is in a persistent vegetative state, after a sudden heart attack, with no hope for recovery, but Schiavo's parents would not give up any signs of hope.
This was the second time the Florida legislature acted over the fate of Schiavo.
In October 2003, Florida Governor Jeb Bush invoked a law rushed through the state legislature to overrule a court ruling authorizing the removal of the life support for Schiavo.
But the Florida Supreme Court ruled later that his rule was unconstitutional.
The US House of Representatives passed legislation late Wednesday that would allow such a case to be moved to federal courts, which have twice turned down Schiavo's request to intervene.
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, Republican from Tennessee on Thursday urged the Senate to pass a more limited version of the legislation to save Schiavo.
A Florida judge has delayed an order to remove the feeding tube from a brain damaged Florida woman at 1 p.m. Friday after Washington lawmakers intervened by issuing subpoenas for the woman and her husband to appear at congressional hearings later this month.
The order by Judge David Demers of Pinellas Pasco Circuit Court came in response to efforts in the U.S. House and Senate to circumvent an order to remove the tube from the woman, Terri Schiavo, who suffered severe brain damage 15 years ago.
Demers' order was intended to be in force for less than an hour, to give the presiding judge in the long running case, George W. Greer of Pinellas Pasco Circuit Court, time to get to his chambers and weigh the latest developments.
The Washington lawmakers' extraordinary maneuvers managed to block, at least temporarily, decisions by several courts over the last few years that have sided with Schiavo's husband, Michael Schiavo, who said his wife would not want to be kept alive in her present condition.
The subpoenas came from a House committee inviting Schiavo, 41, and her husband, Michael, to appear before Congress next week.
A Senate committee also issued an invitation for the Schiavos to appear on Capitol Hill.
The Senate majority leader, Sen Bill Frist, R Tenn., issued a statement saying that Schiavos and her husband were being called in connection with a congressional inquiry into the matter later this month.
The statement pointed out that federal law protects witnesses called before Congress "from anyone who may obstruct or impede a witness' attendance or testimony."
The maneuver is the latest step by lawmakers who are determined to keep Schiavo alive to prevent doctors from beginning to withhold nutrition and fluids from her, a process that could result in her death in anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.
Friday's 1 p.m. deadline set by Greer followed years of legal wrangling between Schiavo's husband, who wants to let her die, and her parents, who believe she responds to them and want her to live.
The last minute actions in Washington have prolonged the drama about who ultimately has the right to determine the woman's fate, as relatives and other supporters of right to life causes who have been attracted to Schiavo's case gathered outside the Clearwater, Fla., hospice where she lies in a hospital bed.
Schiavo collapsed in 1990 and suffered extensive brain damage when her heart briefly stopped, possibly due to a potassium deficiency.
Eight years later, her husband wanted to remove her feeding tube, setting off years of legal feuding with her parents that has taken both sides from the state and federal courts to the State Legislature to the U.S. Supreme Court, and now to Congress.
"The Senate and House remain dedicated to saving Terry Schiavo's life," Frist said, adding that March 28 was the date set for the Schiavos to appear in Congress.
"The purpose of the hearing is to review health care policies and practices relevant to the care of nonambulatory persons such as Mrs Schiavo."
Doctors on Friday removed the feeding tube of Terri Schiavo, the severely brain damaged woman at the center of a scorching multiyear legal battle, despite an extraordinary series of last minute efforts by Congress to halt the process and prolong her life.
The tube's removal came at 1:45 p.m., shortly after a state judge bluntly rejected attempts by the House of Representatives to intervene in the case, saying it had no jurisdiction.
The judge, George W. Greer of Pinellas Pasco Circuit Court, turned down a House request for a nine day postponement so that members of the House Government Reform Committee could travel from Washington to hold a meeting in Schiavo's hospice room here.
"I see no cogent reason why the committee should be able to intervene into a case involving the decision of whether or not to remain on life support," Greer, who has presided over Schiavo's case since 1998, said in a hearing held by telephone conference.
"I don't think that legislative agencies or bodies have business in court proceedings."
Earlier in the day, the House committee issued subpoenas for Schiavo, 41, and her husband, Michael, to appear at congressional hearings later this month.
A Senate committee made a similar move.
Since Schiavo is incapacitated and cannot speak, the lawmakers' were hoping that by issuing a subpoena they could block the removal of the feeding tube through a law intended to protect people called to testify before Congress.
Without the liquid meals that have sustained her for the last 15 years, Schiavo will likely not survive more than two weeks, doctors say.
The withdrawal of her feeding tube is the latest chapter of a saga pitting her husband, who believes she has no cognition and wants her to die, against her parents, who believe she responds to their voices and can improve with therapy.
Schiavo was 26 when her heart briefly stopped beating one night in 1990, starving her brain of oxygen long enough to cause extensive damage.
Doctors have said she was suffering a potassium deficiency, possibly due to an eating disorder.
While the prolonged battle over her fate had largely been concentrated in the Florida courts and Legislature, it burst onto the national political scene this week as conservative lawmakers rushed to take up her case as a symbol of the sanctity of life.
"She has constitutional rights to live," said Rep Tom DeLay, R Texas, the House majority leader, "and we are trying to protect her constitutional right to live and more important than that, her constitutional right not to have somebody else decide her future by pulling out a feeding tube and letting her starve for two weeks."
Scott McClellan, President Bush's spokesman, said the White House was watching the developments in Florida.
"The president believes that when there are serious questions or doubts in a case like this, that the presumption ought to be in the favor of life," he said.
In their efforts to win support for their cause, Schiavo's parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, have circulated pictures and videos of their daughter appearing to smile at her mother, track a balloon with her eyes and respond to other stimuli from her bed at Woodside Hospice, where she has lived since 2000.
Television stations around the world have played the images repeatedly in recent weeks, but most doctors say that what appear to be emotion and cognition are in fact involuntary reflexes.
A series of courts have accepted the testimony of doctors who say Schiavo is in a "persistent vegetative state," meaning she does not comprehend language or expressions or interact with others.
Yet Barbara Weller, a lawyer for the Schindlers, told reporters outside the hospice that Schiavo had responded emphatically Friday morning when Weller asked her to say, "I want to live."
According to Weller, Schiavo's eyes "just popped right open" and she made loud noises, startling a police officer stationed outside her room, then wept.
Michael Schiavo's chief lawyer, George Felos, described federal efforts to delay the tube removal as "thuggery" and an assault on civil liberties.
He said that lawmakers had no intention of investigating the case and were merely pandering to constituents who were pressuring them to intervene.
"It was odious, it was shocking, it was disgusting and I think all Americans should be alarmed," Felos said.
On Capitol Hill, Republicans justified their actions by saying they were taking the steps necessary to protect potential evidence and witnesses that could be needed for Senate and House investigations into the care of incapacitated adults.
"We're holding a legitimate legislative inquiry," said Rep Tom Davis, R Va., chairman of the Government Reform Committee, after he authorized subpoenas in the case.
In the Senate, the Health committee issued an invitation to Terri Schiavo to appear at a hearing, a move that congressional officials said could result in criminal charges against anyone who impedes her attendance.
The flurry of congressional action came after the House and Senate failed Thursday to agree on legislation that could take the case out of state courts, an impasse that continued Friday.
State legislators in Tallahassee also failed this week to pass legislation that might block the feeding tube's removal, despite intense pressure from Gov. Jeb Bush and conservative religious groups, who bombarded lawmakers with e mail.
Those groups say they are against ending any life prematurely and equate the withdrawal of Schiavo's feeding tube with abortion.
Randall Terry, founder of the anti abortion group Operation Rescue, said he and other conservatives would continue lobbying Congress and the Florida Legislature to pass bills that could prolong Schiavo's life.
In particular, he said, they would urge the House of Representatives to take up a bill passed by the Senate Thursday, which would set up a federal court hearing in cases like Schiavo's to evaluate whether the state had followed all requirements for judicial due process.
"We will hold the House leadership accountable if this thing fails," said Terry, who acted as a spokesman for the Schindlers outside the hospice Friday.
"The conservative right of this country has labored fiercely for two decades to finally get control of both houses.
We didn't get here so they could pour this down the drain."
After Schiavo's feeding tube was removed, Republican leaders of Congress expressed strong disappointment and pledged to work through the weekend to try to strike an agreement on legislation that could shift the case into federal court.
"Right now, murder is being committed against a defenseless American citizen in Florida," DeLay said.
"Terri Schiavo's feeding tube should be immediately replaced, and Congress will continue working to explore ways to save her."
Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, steered clear of the issue for the most part, though some continued to wonder if Congress should be so deeply involved.
"I intend to do all I can to see that any action Congress takes is constructive and free from partisan politics, and does not make a tragic situation worse by exploiting this terrible tragedy," said Sen Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the senior Democrat on the health committee.
In a meeting with reporters, DeLay, joined by other senior Republicans, again insisted that the best way to resolve the deadlock was for the Senate to on Monday approve a much broader House passed measure that would apply new federal legal protection in all such cases.
But Senate officials were pessimistic they could force the House bill through since it had drawn strong objections from members of both parties previously.
DeLay and Rep Roy Blunt of Missouri, the majority whip, said their viewing of videotape of Schiavo convinced them she wanted to live and they were not persuaded by her husband's claim that she would prefer to be allowed to die.
"I think the sanctity of life overshadows the sanctity of marriage," said DeLay.
The ivory billed woodpecker, a bird long thought extinct, has been sighted in the swamp forests of eastern Arkansas for the first time in more than 60 years, Cornell University scientists said Thursday.
The bird, one of the largest species of woodpecker in the world, disappeared after large scale logging felled thousands of acres of forest in the Southeast between the 1880s and 1940s.
Scientists said they could confirm the existence of at least one male.
The last conclusive sighting of the woodpecker in North America occurred in Cuba in 1944.
"It's a landmark rediscovery," said Scott Simon, director of the Nature Conservancy's Arkansas chapter.
The sighting of the woodpecker, which has a distinctive white pattern on its back and on the trailing edges of the wings, was first reported in the journal Science on its Web site Thursday.
The woodpecker has been spotted independently several times in the past year and a half, including Feb 27, 2004, when two researchers in search of the bird set out on a canoe in a bayou in Arkansas' Big Woods: 550000 acres of bottomland forest, bayous and oxbow lakes.
The scientists, Tim Gallagher, editor of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Living Bird magazine, and Bobby Harrison, a professor at Oakwood College in Huntsville, Ala.,were paddling in a bayou when a black and white bird flew about 70 feet in front of them.
Simultaneously, they shouted, "Ivory bill!"
After the woodpecker flew back into the forest, the two each sketched the bird from memory.
"When we finished our notes," Gallagher told Science.
"Bobby sat down on a log, put his face in his hands and began to sob, saying: 'I saw an ivory bill.
I saw an ivory bill.'
" Gallagher told the journal that at the time he was too overcome to speak.
"Just to think this bird made it into the 21st century gives me chills," he said.
"It's like a funeral shroud has been pulled back, giving us a glimpse of a living bird, rising Lazarus like from the grave."
Two months later, a search team of field biologists headed by Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology and the Nature Conservancy, spotted the woodpecker and a researcher eventually captured on videotape four seconds of an ivory bill alighting from the trunk of a tree.
In all, there have been 15 sightings of the bird since February 2004 during a period of more than 7000 hours of searching.
For nearly 60 years, bird lovers have slogged through the swampwaters of the Deep South, along the bayous and rivers feeding the Mississippi River, searching in vain for a spectacular bird long thought to be extinct the ivory billed woodpecker.
In news bound to electrify bird lovers worldwide, scientists are expected to announce today the "rediscovery" of the ivory bill in a remote swampy area of northeast Arkansas known as the Big Woods.
At least one male ivory bill has been found alive and well in the deep forest of bottomland hardwoods between Little Rock and Memphis.
It is the first confirmed sighting of the long sought bird since World War II.
Other ivory bills are presumed to be living there.
For thousands of birding enthusiasts, the confirmation of a sighting will be a dream come true.
"It's incredible news," said Steve R. Runnels, president of the American Birding Association.
"This is the most exciting ornithological discovery in a long, long time."
U.S. Interior Secretary Gale Norton and officials with the Nature Conservancy, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission are scheduled to make the announcement in Washington this morning.
'Dramatic rediscovery' The Interior Department touted the event as "the dramatic rediscovery of a species previously believed extinct."
The on line edition of Science magazine is expected to publish today a detailed account of the woodpecker's rediscovery.
As word about the woodpecker leaked out, birder chat lines were buzzing and calls poured in to birding organizations.
Late Wednesday afternoon, Mary Scott, an Arizona birding enthusiast who has pursued the ivory billed woodpecker for years, posted on the Internet an account of her personal encounter with the bird in Arkansas.
She said her sighting two years ago of the white striped woodpecker with a crested crown helped spur scientists and conservation officials to come to Arkansas and confirm that the bird, indeed, is living there.
"For me, the search for the ivory billed woodpecker has ended," she said.
The moment she first saw the bird was unforgettable.
"The sight was overwhelming," she recalled.
"It was huge, and was hanging from the trunk of the tree."
She insisted the exact location be kept secret to prevent hordes of birdwatchers from thundering into the area, eager to add an ivory bill sighting to their "life lists" of species they have seen.
Runnels agreed the location should not be revealed.
"It would be a nightmare with all the people trying to see the bird," he said.
Larger than a crow, the ivory billed woodpecker was and perhaps still is at 20 inches the largest woodpecker in North America.
Its call, say those who have heard it, is a nasal "kent kent kent," what some say is like the sound of a child's tin horn.
The bird once ranged from Texas to North Carolina.
Most experts believe the woodpecker became extinct in the United States because its habitats of old growth forest and bottomland swamps were felled for timber and drained, its rich soils planted in cotton and soybeans or the land developed.
One of the last places the bird had been seen was along the Altamaha River in Georgia in the 1930s.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducted a futile five year search in Georgia and other Southern states in the 1980s.
Reliable sightings of a subspecies of ivory bill in Cuba were reported in 1986, but information since then has been sketchy.
In 2002, a research team embarked on a 30 day expedition in the Louisiana Mississippi Pearl River Wildlife Management Area, about an hour's drive from New Orleans, to try to find the woodpecker.
The researchers were acting on a reported sighting by Louisiana State University forestry student David Kulivan in April 1999.
The bird was never tracked down.
Intriguing mystery Over the years, the ivory bill's rarity, beauty and the intriguing mystery of whether it survives have captured the imaginations of bird enthusiasts.
Former President Theodore Roosevelt, who hunted in the Mississippi River woodlands, once wrote that "the great ivory billed woodpecker ,seemed to me to set off the wilderness of the swamp as much as the beasts of the chase."
Confirming the bird's identity has been complicated by its resemblance to a close cousin the pileated woodpecker.
The pileated is smaller and its markings are a bit different.
While perching, the back of a pileated is solid black, while a perched ivory bill sports large patches of white in the form of a shield on the lower back.
"It will take a lot to convince me that they have found the ivory billed woodpecker," said Gary Lester, head of Louisiana's Natural Heritage Program, who took part in the 2002 search.

The ivory billed woodpecker, once prized for its plumage and sought by American Indians as magical, was thought to be extinct for years.
Now it's been sighted again and conservationists are exulting.
The striking bird, last seen in 1944, has been rediscovered in the Big Woods area of Arkansas, scientists and conservationists reported Thursday.
"This is thrilling beyond words ,after 60 years of fading hope that we would ever see this spectacular bird again," John W. Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, said at a news conference.
Since early 2004 there have been several independent sightings, including one caught on videotape, of one or more of the birds, Fitzpatrick said.
That video of the bird's 3 foot (0.91 meters) wingspan and distinctive black and white markings confirmed the presence of the creature that seemed to have vanished after logging destroyed its habitat.
The discovery of living examples of an animal believed to be extinct is rare, said Tess Present, director of science at the National Audubon Society.
"Wow," she said.
"This is tremendous."
Interior Secretary Gale Norton said, "Second chances to save wildlife once thought to be extinct are rare,We will take advantage of this opportunity."
Norton and Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns promised millions of dollars in federal assistance to work with the state and local residents to protect this bird.
"Don't love this bird to death," Norton added, saying there has not been time to make plans for public access to view the bird.
Fitzpatrick's report was released by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which is publishing the study in the journal Science, and also announced by the Nature Conservancy.
Alan Wormington of Ontario, Canada, said the discovery brought tears to his eyes.
Wormington was part of a group that spent a month unsuccessfully trying to confirm reports of ivory billed woodpeckers in Louisiana in 2002.
"The implications are staggering," he said.
The ivory billed woodpecker, one of the largest such birds in the world, is one of six North American bird species thought to have become extinct since 1880.
The bird ranged widely across the southeastern United States at one time.
Once sought by Indians who believed that its bill possessed magical powers, the bird also was hunted for its feathers so they could adorn women's hats.
Loss of habitat was its main threat, however.
The ivory bill sometimes called the white back, pearly bill, poule de bois and even Lord God bird was known for the two note rap of its bill as it ripped into tree bark in search of edible grubs and beetle larvae.
Fitzpatrick said it became known as the Lord God bird because people seeing it would exclaim "Lord God, look at that bird."
He said the researchers reported a similar reaction when they spotted it from a canoe last year.
The woodpecker suddenly swooped in front and might even have landed on the canoe, but they all suddenly shouted: "Ivory bill!"
There have been anecdotal reports of the birds, but the last conclusive sighting in continental North America was in 1944, in northern Louisiana.
A subspecies of the bird has been reported in Cuba.
The ivory billed woodpecker, which was last seen in 1944 and feared extinct, has been seen in a protected forest in Arkansas, scientists said Thursday.
"The ivory billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), long suspected to be extinct, has been rediscovered in the 'Big Woods' region of eastern Arkansas", researchers reported in the journal Science to be published.
The rediscovery "is thrilling beyond words", John W. Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, told reporters.
The bird was spotted near where it was last seen.
The first sighting of the spectacular bird is reported to be on Feb 11, 2004, and has been followed by several others, including one on April 25, 2004, in which the bird was videotaped.
The ivory billed woodpecker is one of six North American bird species thought to have gone extinct since 1880.
The black and white bird, with a nearly one meter wingspan and its distinctive ivory colored bill, is larger than the more common pileated woodpecker that is similar in appearance.
The bird can live as long as 15 years.
The ivory billed woodpecker, long thought to have been pushed into extinction by massive logging of the American Southeast, has been spotted by scientists for the first time in 60 years soaring through the wild swamplands of southern Arkansas.
The disappearance of the bird, one of the world's largest woodpeckers, has long been held up as a symbol of the disappearance of the American wilderness.
Its reappearance was hailed today as a validation of efforts to preserve and restore forested areas throughout the country.
"This is huge," said Frank Gill, a former president of the Audubon Society.
"It's kind of like finding Elvis."
Reports of sightings have appeared sporadically since the last confirmed appearance of the bird in 1944, but researchers generally have dismissed the reports as the overenthusiastic imaginings of amateurs.
The new conclusion that the species is still extant is based on at least eight separate sightings in the last year many of them by experienced ornithologists and a video captured by David Luneau of the University of Arkansas, Little Rock.
"The bird captured on video is clearly an ivory billed woodpecker," said ornithologist John Weaver Fitzpatrick of Cornell University, who reported the finding with his colleagues Thursday in the online version of the journal Science.
The bird is hard to misidentify.
It has a three foot wingspan, is 19 to 21 inches long, and has distinctive black and white markings.
They are second in size only to the imperial woodpecker of Mexico.
Interior Secretary Gale Norton called the find an "exciting opportunity."
"Second chances to save wildlife once thought to be extinct are rare," she said at a news conference Thursday, where she announced $10 million in new funds to bolster restoration of the Big Woods of southern Arkansas, where the bird was spotted.
Biologist E. O. Wilson called them "the signature bird" of the southern coastal plain.
Males have a red crest, while females have a black head and crest.
White wing patches and a stripe down the side of the head and continuing down its back distinguish the ivory billed bird from the pileated woodpecker, which is nearly as large and much more abundant.
The birds also have a large, light colored, chisel tipped bill, the pileated woodpecker has a much darker bill.
Dead trees provide nesting sites and food.
The birds remove bark by pecking at it with their characteristic double tap drumming which researchers also have heard frequently in the Big Woods area.
Females lay a clutch of three to four eggs, for which the males assume sole responsibility at night.
A nesting pair require about three square miles of forest for sustenance, so that even when the birds were widespread, their populations were never dense.
The creature is sometimes called the "Lord, God bird," Fitzpatrick said Thursday.
"It's such a striking bird that, when people would see it, they would say, 'Lord, God, what a woodpecker!"
The current surge of interest began on Feb 11, 2004, when amateur ornithologist Gene M. Sparling III of Hot Springs, Ark., saw what he thought was an ivory billed woodpecker while kayaking in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge and reported it to a bird watchers' Web site.
A week later, Tim W. Gallagher of Cornell and Bobby R. Harrison of Oakwood College in Huntsville, Ala., interviewed him and were so impressed by his account that they accompanied him on a second trip.
On Feb 27, a large black and white woodpecker flew less than 70 feet in front of their canoe on the bayou.
Both simultaneously cried out, "Ivory bill!"
Researchers then organized several bird watching expeditions, spending a total of more than 7000 hours seeking sightings.
They had six, all of which were too fleeting for photography.
Ultimately, Luneau reasoned that their best bet was to leave a video camera running constantly and he captured four seconds of footage showing the bird taking off from the trunk of a tupelo tree.
Scientists do not know how many ivory billed woodpeckers there are in the region or whether they have actually seen many or just one male.
Because the lifespan is only about 16 years, Fitzpatrick speculated that there is at least one breeding pair.
Researchers said that the Big Woods area has been in the process of restoration for several years and is now about 40 percent along the way toward maturity.
Restoration has probably provided new food and nesting sites for what might have been a very small group of the birds, allowing their numbers to expand to a point where they began to come in contact with humans.
After decades of legends, rumors and anecdotes, scientists Thursday announced something of an ornithological miracle: multiple confirmed sightings of the ivory billed woodpecker, a bird whose last confirmed sighting dates back to World War II.
Visual encounters, a blurry video clip, and the woodpecker's distinctive "double knock" drumming have convinced a group of 16 researchers that a bird long believed extinct still resides within the Big Woods region of eastern Arkansas.
"Through the 20th century, it's literally been every birder's fantasy to see this bird," said John Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and a co author of the study, published Thursday in an online edition of the journal Science.
"This is really the Holy Grail for birds."
Or the ornithological equivalent of seeing Elvis, as some birders have termed it.
Rarely seen after the mid 1800s, the largest woodpecker in North America was believed to have gone extinct after deforestation decimated its habitat in the swampy woodlands of the South.
The last known individual, a female, was last documented in a logged tract of northeastern Louisiana in 1944.
"It's legendary, it's mysterious, it has been a majestic symbol of America's South," Fitzpatrick said in explaining the bird's superstar status.
In February 2004, Hot Springs naturalist Gene Sparling III spotted an unusually large woodpecker while kayaking in the 550000 acre Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in eastern Arkansas.
His posting on a Web site attracted the attention of ornithologists, who eventually launched multiple expeditions to the site.
Scientists used video footage from another observer and at least eight eyewitness accounts to rule out the superficially similar pileated woodpecker.
Sherman Suter, an editor at Science, said reviewers and editors "overwhelmingly agreed" that the evidence was solid.
Despite the report, scientists cannot rule out the possibility that all of their encounters involved the same red crested male.
Nevertheless, Fitzpatrick said the presence of at least one bird strongly suggests the presence of more.
"The life span of a woodpecker rarely exceeds 15 years, and would never hit 20," he said.
"That means that there's breeding activity long after everyone thought this bird was gone."
News of the find buoyed naturalists across the country.
"Incredible!
Unbelievable!
There's no bigger bird story than this," said E.J. McAdams, executive director of New York City Audubon.
M. David Luneau Jr., a professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock who captured the crucial video footage, explained why the woodpecker is sometimes called the 'Lord God' bird: "When people would see it, they would utter, 'Lord God, what a bird!'
" Long Island resident Virginia Eckelberry, 91, recalled how her late husband, renowned bird illustrator Don.
R. Eckelberry, expressed awe over his own "spectacular" encounters with the woodpecker in 1944 the last official sighting in the United States.
The wildlife artist, who died in 2001, would have expressed skepticism over Thursday's news, his wife said so many people have wanted to see the bird so badly, after all.
"If this one has managed to live unnoticed for all these years, it would seem like it would be a miracle," she said.
"It would be the best news ever."
Frank Gill, the National Audubon Society's senior ornithologist, said he views the discovery as a rallying cry for naturalists who had all but given up hope on the bird and an equally elusive Cuban subspecies.
As for the future, no one can yet say.
But for ornithologists, the present feels pretty good.
"There is no birder in America," Fitzpatrick said, "who doesn't feel a certain hair standing up on the back of the neck at the thought that this bird could still be around."
The ivory billed woodpecker, a magnificent bird long given up for extinct, has been sighted in the cypress and tupelo swamp of the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge here in Arkansas, scientists announced Thursday.
Bird experts, government agencies and conservation organizations involved kept the discovery secret for more than a year, while they worked to confirm the discovery and protect the bird's territory.
Their announcement on Thursday brought rejoicing among birdwatchers, for whom the ivory bill has long been a holy grail a creature that has been called the Lord God bird, apparently because that is what people exclaimed when they saw it.
Dr John Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, who led the effort to confirm the sightings, said at a news conference in Washington, "This is really the most spectacular creature we could imagine rediscovering."
He was joined by Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton, who announced that the agency, along with the Department of Agriculture, had proposed to spend $10 million in federal money for research, habitat protection and law enforcement efforts to protect the bird.
The Nature Conservancy and other conservation groups have bought land in the region of the refuge to help preserve a larger area.
The bird was seen in thickly forested bottomland here, the deep, wet woods immortalized by Faulkner.
Today, researchers were traveling by canoe down slow flowing clay colored bayous hoping for another sighting, and working to finish up surveys of the territory.
With its 30 inch wingspan and formidable bill, sharp black and white coloring, and the male's carmine crest, the ivory bill was the largest of American woodpeckers, described by John James Audubon as "this great chieftain of the Woodpecker tribe."
Once a dominant creature of great Southern hardwood forest, its numbers dwindled as logging increased.
The woodpecker inspired one of the first conservation efforts in the nation's history, but its seeming failure turned the ivory bill into a symbol of loss.
The last documented sighting was in Louisiana in 1944.
But the ivory bill lived on as a kind of ghost in rumor and in numerous possible sightings.
Despite lengthy expeditions, no sighting was confirmed, until Feb 11, 2004.
While jubilant bird lovers rejoiced Thursday over the "rediscovery" of the fabled ivory billed woodpecker, the government promised to spend millions of dollars to protect the bird and its habitat, a remote Arkansas swamp.
"Second chances to save wildlife once thought to be extinct are rare," said Interior Secretary Gale Norton.
"We will take advantage of this opportunity."
Sam Hamilton, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regional office in Atlanta, will head a team of wildlife experts to develop a plan to protect the ivory bill and increase its numbers.
A striking, hefty bird, Campephilus principalis was last seen in 1944 and was feared vanished forever.
Hamilton said that one of his first priorities was to bolster law enforcement in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in northeast Arkansas, midway between Little Rock and Memphis, because of an expected influx of people wanting to see the bird.
At least one male of the species was seen there several times and caught on videotape during the past year.
Scientists said perhaps two dozen or more of the birds live in the dense forest.
The Cache River refuge is part of a larger swath known as the Big Woods 550000 acres of bayou, bottomland forests and oxbow lakes.
"Our immediate concern now is to make sure that the bird and the area it occupies are protected," Hamilton said.
He said that his team would develop a plan as soon as possible to accommodate the thousands of bird enthusiasts who will want to visit the bottomland swamp forest to catch a glimpse of the long missing woodpecker.
Norton, however, issued a plea for the public "not to love this bird to death."
She said that the departments of Interior and Agriculture propose spending more than $10 million to protect the bird.
Private groups and contributors will give another $10 million.
Norton and officials with the Nature Conservancy, Cornell Lab of Ornithology, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Arkansas Game and Fish Commission announced the discovery in Washington.
The online edition of Science magazine also published a detailed account of finding the bird.
Video of the 20 inch bird's 3 foot wingspan and distinctive black and white markings confirmed that it was not extinct, as long feared.
"The bird captured on video is clearly an ivory billed woodpecker," said John Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell lab and lead author of the Science article.
"Amazingly, America may have another chance to protect the future of this spectacular bird and the awesome forests in which it lives."
He and other scientists said that other ivory bills, whose life span is about 15 years, undoubtedly are living in the deep emerald forests of the Big Woods area.
Mary Scott, an Arizona birding enthusiast who has pursued the ivory bill for years, said this week that she saw the bird two years ago and reported her sightings to the Cornell lab and other groups.
But Cornell officials said the search for the bird began in earnest in February 2004, after a kayaker, Gene Sparling of Hot Springs, Ark., saw an unusually large, red crested woodpecker fly toward him and land on a nearby tree.
He noticed several field markings suggesting the bird was an ivory bill.
Based on Sparling's report, two other experts, Tim Gallagher of the Cornell Lab and Bobby Harrison of Oakwood College in Huntsville, Ala., went with Sparling into the bayou where the bird was seen.
As the three paddled in the waterway, a large black and white woodpecker flew less than 70 feet away.
"Ivory bill," cried out Gallagher and Harrison, who quickly went ashore to sketch what they had seen.
Their field sketches show the species' characteristic wing patterns of white and black.
"When we finished our notes," Gallagher said, "Bobby sat down on a log, put his face in his hands and began to sob, saying, 'I saw an ivory bill.
I saw an ivory bill."'
Gallagher said he was too choked with emotion to speak.
"Just to think this bird made it into the 21st century gives me chills," he said.
"It's like a funeral shroud has been pulled back, giving us a glimpse of a living bird, rising Lazarus like from the grave."
The sightings led to the formation of a search team, which became the Big Woods Conservation Partnership.
Later, three searchers spied an ivory bill in the refuge.
The fleeting views left little chance for photographs.
David Lunea of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock said the best way to record the bird was to have a camcorder at all times.
He captured four seconds of video footage showing an ivory bill taking off from a tupelo tree trunk.

Twenty years ago, Chris Pague picked up a stuffed specimen of an ivory billed woodpecker and marveled at what had been lost.
So the news that the magnificent bird has been found in an Arkansas swamp six decades after it was thought to be extinct in the United States hit the Nature Conservancy ecologist like a thunderclap.
"This is one of those pivotal moments in conservation," he said Thursday at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. "
The rediscovery of a bird thought to have vanished due to overlogging of its swamp habitat electrified scientists and birders, and sharpened the long standing debate over how best to conserve rare and imperiled species.
The discovery conclusively demonstrates the importance of preserving "big, intact landscapes," Pague said.
"These hardwood swamps were protected for warblers and ducks not ivory bills," he said.
"But it has the big old trees the ivory bill needs."
Rediscovery of the striking bird also will launch a storm of research.
Rob Roy Ramey II, the Denver museum's zoology curator, intends to start a DNA study from tissue in the feet of the six ivory bills in their collection within two weeks.
The DNA from those and other specimens might then be compared with eggshells from wild birds to determine how much genetic diversity has been lost.
The team of researchers that obtained conclusive video of an ivory bill made several more sightings and announced their findings Thursday in the journal Science.
Federal officials immediately moved to protect the woodpecker.
Interior Secretary Gale Norton announced $10 million in federal funding, to go with $10 million already raised by private groups, to create a conservation plan to help restore the ivory bill.
North America's largest woodpecker, the bird was named for the long, ivory colored bill it uses to pry grubs from dying swamp trees.
It is considered the Holy Grail for birders, who find its striking plumage and imperial demeanor so magnificent that some dubbed it "the Lord god bird" as in "Lord god, what a bird."
Many conservation groups say the ivory bill's persistence is proof that the Endangered Species Act should be retained, including elements that require protecting the kind of habitat critical for species recovery.
"Any reduction in protection is likely to spell doom of many, many species that are not as special or showy as ivory bill, but have the same right to existence," said David Ehrenfeld, a Rutgers professor and founder of Conservation Biology Magazine.
The Bush administration said Thursday's news validates their conservation model.
The ivory bill was found in an area where public and private partnerships have helped create conditions for the bird to recover.
"We don't have the time to take sides because the world is changing and we have to conserve as much as can as fast as can," said Scott Simon, executive director of the Arkansas Nature Conservancy.
Some question whether the ivory bill will benefit from all the attention.
"This is great for conservation," said Ehrenfeld.
"It's probably not a good thing for the bird.
Too many people will look for it."
But the most immediate and certain result of the ivory bill's rediscovery, observers agree, is a big dose of hope, optimism and wonder.
"It's the Lazarus bird it was 'extinct' for generations and now it's back," said birder and local author Mark Obmascik.
"There's something magical about having something like the ivory bill living on after all this time in spite of us."
Experts have rediscovered the Ivory billed woodpecker in the United States 61 years after it was put on the extinct list and the government said Thursday that 10 million dollars would be spent to make sure it stays alive.
Ornitholigists said several sightings of the bird had been made in a refuge in Arkansas state and video of the bird made last year was released on Thursday.
More than 50 experts and biologists took part in an operation to find the bird again after the initial sighting was made by a kayaker on the White River in eastern Arkansas, National Public Radio (NPR) reported.
It was last sighted in 1944 and was thought to have fallen victim of widespread logging in the region.
Experts from the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology in New York and The Nature Conservancy kept the woodpecker's existence a secret for more than a year to allow time to protect the bird's habitat in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas.
The Nature Conservancy and federal agencies have been buying land in the district to better protect the bird's habitat.
The Interior Department and the Department of Agriculture said they would spend more than 10 million dollars to protect the Ivory billed woodpecker, a large, showy bird with a red head and cream coloured bill.
Private groups and individuals have already committed about 10 million dollars to buy land and research the woodpecker's habitat.
"This is a rare second chance to preserve through cooperative conservation what was once thought lost forever," said Interior Secretary Gale Norton.
Scientists and birders will resume their search this winter for the elusive ivory billed woodpecker to prove, once and for all, that the bird really lives in the vast eastern Arkansas wetlands.
The bird, with its massive wingspan and signature double rap, was thought to have been extinct for decades when a kayaker reported finding one in February 2004.
In April, the interior secretary acknowledged the chance sighting.
But the steamy Arkansas summer conditions halted the search for the woodpecker.
"The birds are relatively silent," said Tim Gallagher of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and member of the search team.
"The woods, they're like a jungle, just thick foliage, just incredibly hot, humid, buggy and snakes everywhere.
Everything about it is just as bad as could be."
Now that leaves are falling off the trees, creating a clearer view, and the snakes are at bay, search conditions are perfect for woodpecker spotting, Gallagher said.
"The birds tend to be more vocal and active because they're coming into breeding season and it's much easier to see," Gallagher said.
A crew from Cornell and its partner agencies will train 100 volunteers for the six month search of 500000 acres (200000 hectares), Gallagher said.
Finding a nest, or even better, a breeding pair of woodpeckers that could be nurtured, would be a major breakthrough, Gallagher said.
"It would re energize the whole process," he said.
"There are a lot of people who really want to see some more solid evidence."
The search includes stationary observers, teams in canoes on rivers and streams and recorders and video cameras set in the area to possibly catch the bird's sounds.
"We will continue to search for this bird until we find it," said Gene Sparling, the Hot Springs canoeist who spotted the woodpecker in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge.
"He's out there somewhere."
The phoenix had nothing on the ivory billed woodpecker.
It is hard to keep track of how many times this near mythic bird, the largest American woodpecker and a poignant symbol of extinction and disappearing forests, has been lost and then found.
Now it is found again.
Even the most skeptical ornithologists now agree.
They say that newly presented evidence shows that at least two of the birds are living in Arkansas.
Richard O. Prum, an ornithologist at Yale University and one of several scientists who had challenged the most recently claimed rediscovery of the ivory bill, said Monday after listening to tape recordings that he was now "strongly convinced that there is at least a pair of ivory bills out there."
Mark B. Robbins, an ornithologist at the University of Kansas, who had also been a skeptic, listened to the same recordings with a graduate student and said, "We were absolutely stunned."
Robbins said the recordings, provided by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, were "astounding."
Of a paper questioning claims of the woodpecker's discovery that he, Prum and another scientist had submitted to the Public Library of Science, he said, "It's all moot at this point, the bird's here."
That was what the Cornell lab said last April, when it announced that an ivory bill had been sighted in February 2004 in the Cache River Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas.
Last April, a group of scientists published a paper in the journal Science on the rediscovery, with a heavily analyzed but blurry video.
After widespread euphoria, three skeptics Prum, Robbins and Jerome A. Jackson, a zoologist at Florida Gulf Coast University prepared their criticism.
Prominent birders like David Allen Sibley and Kenn Kaufman, both authors of bird guides, agreed that the evidence in the Science paper was not conclusive.
But while the skeptics' paper was still in preparation, the Cornell team provided several audio recordings to Prum and Robbins.
Jackson, who was out of the country, had not had a chance to listen to the recordings, Prum said.
The evidence the characteristic nasal "kent" call and double raps on a tree was so convincing that Prum and Robbins withdrew their challenge.
"The thrilling new sound recordings provide clear and convincing evidence that the ivory billed woodpecker is not extinct," Prum said in a statement.
The snippet of videotape that until now was the strongest individual piece of evidence showed only one bird.
But the sound recordings, made over many months in the White River National Wildlife Refuge, just south of Cache River, provide vital signs that a potential breeding population persists, said experts and officials involved with the search.
"We felt all along that the White River was probably the core of the bird's habitat and it was dispersing out," said Sam Hamilton, the southeastern regional director for the federal Fish and Wildlife Service and the chairman of a panel that is overseeing the drafting of the federal recovery plan for the bird.
The scientific consensus on the strength of the sound recordings from that region was "very, very exciting," Hamilton said.
"It gives you chill bumps to think about that vast bottomland hardwood being certainly home to more than one bird."
Prum said the double raps appeared to be from a pair of ivory bills communicating with each other, one close and one far away.
"I'm thinking about when I should head down to Arkansas," he said.
John W. Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and a primary author of the Science paper that announced the bird's survival, said, "The birds are there, which we knew."
But Fitzpatrick said he was happy that a scientific battle in print had been avoided.
"We sent them the sounds," he said.
"I wish we'd done that earlier."
But he noted that the process was "science in action, at its messy best."
The manager of the 160000 acre White River refuge, Larry E. Mallard, said the boggy woodlands there had been actively logged for generations in a way that took care to protect areas friendly to wildlife.
As a result, Mallard said, one rare species after another has returned, including bald eagles and swallow tailed kites.
The ivory bill topped it all, he said.
"Now Elvis has come along," he said, "and said: 'I'm the rock star.
Look at me."'
More than 30 bird experts now spend each day in the swampy forests of eastern Arkansas, tying audio and video recording devices onto tree trunks, paddling quietly in canoes, and sitting on camouflaged wooden platforms near ancient cypresses, just waiting for the rare ivory billed woodpecker to appear.
More than six months after scientists announced to the world that they had rediscovered the presumed extinct bird, they are in the midst of an unprecedented search for the icon.
It is a campaign that could transform the nation's conservation debate, and it has already altered the small town adjoining the bird's natural habitat.
"We've got all the people, the equipment in place, now all we need is a little luck," said Ken Levenstein, crew leader for the 22 scientists who are searching full time for the woodpecker until the end of April 2006 along with a rotating group of 112 volunteers.
A group of bird researchers including officials from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, and the Nature Conservancy electrified birders in late April when they declared the ivory billed woodpecker had survived undetected in the Big Woods, more than half a million acres of bottomland hardwood forest an hour's drive from Little Rock.
In February 2004 Gene Sparling, a local birder, first saw the woodpecker, which had not been seen conclusively since 1944, and in the ensuing year other researchers spotted it and captured it on film in a blurry four second videotape.
"It's given us a renewed hope that all these efforts, all this work, can pay off," said Sam D. Hamilton, Southeast regional director for Fish and Wildlife.
"It's the story of how you can get a second chance."
Hamilton and other conservationists are anxious to show that the recent sightings are not an aberration but proof that preserving and restoring habitat can sustain some of the nation's most prized species.
While scientists have recorded the bird's telltale double knock over the past year and have spotted it more than half a dozen times, no one has produced the kind of precise photo that could win over skeptics.
"Nobody seems to be able to whip out a camera fast enough," Hamilton said, adding that many Americans may soon lose their appetite for funding the bird's recovery without more conclusive proof.
"We live in a fast moving society, with short memories."
At the moment, advocates of the red crowned bird that helped inspire the cartoon character Woody Woodpecker are pouring enormous sums into locating it and preserving its environs.
Federal authorities have provided $10.2 million toward the effort, and the Nature Conservancy has bought 18500 acres of Big Woods habitat to set aside for the bird since its rediscovery.
Experts believe the bird lives in the Mississippi Delta region, which includes parts of Arkansas' Cache and White rivers.
State and federal lands comprise 300000 acres of the woodpecker's habitat, but the government wants to buy 220000 more acres in the coming decade.
Federal officials, working with local wildlife hunters, already had begun restoring the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge where the bird was found last year.
Dennis Widner, who has managed the refuge since its inception, started planting native bottomland hardwoods from acorns in 1988 and hopes to plant hundreds of thousands more trees in an effort to reconnect the bird's fragmented habitat.
"It's like a jigsaw puzzle you're putting together," Widner said.
"But it's a jigsaw puzzle you won't finish for the next hundred years."
But scientists such as Cornell's Ron Rohrbaugh, who directs the ivory billed woodpecker research project, have a more urgent task.
Rohrbaugh lists it at the top of his PowerPoint presentation on the group's objectives: "Relocate the bird and obtain irrefutable evidence."
This is a challenge.
The bird's range spans as much as 10.4 square miles, making it a bit like "a flying needle in a haystack," as the late expert James Tanner put it.
Sam Stuart, a 25 year old volunteer from Phoenixville, Pa., who arrived in Brinkley on Dec 5, said that after a week in the woods, he now grasps the difficulty of the search.
"We all felt like we were going to come down and find it right away," Stuart said.
"Then you see the enormity of the forest."
Other researchers have tried to find presumed extinct species in the past: Some believe the Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey remains alive in Ivory Coast, and experts continue to search for the elusive thylacine, or Tasmanian wolf.
But few expeditions compare in size or expense to the current woodpecker mission.
In the meantime, local residents who spent years welcoming duck and deer hunters to their area are hoping to capitalize on their small town's newfound birding fame.
Gene Depriest, owner of Gene's Bar B Que, has erected a flashing sign outside his restaurant that declares "The Bird is the Word!

He has put both an "Ivory Bill Burger" (two hamburger patties, mozzarella cheese and tomatoes on a sesame seed bun) and an "Ivory Bill Hot Fudge Brownie" (a brownie with whipped cream and a cherry) on the menu, and sales have increased 25 percent since this spring's announcement.
"I sell a lot of those burgers, especially to people from out of town," said Priest, who gives customers a custom signed "Ivory Bill Burger" certificate if they opt for the $5.75 dish.
"It's really helped business, I tell you that."
Recordings of the ivory billed woodpecker's distinctive double rap sounds have convinced doubting researchers that the large bird once thought extinct is still living in an east Arkansas swamp.
Last month, a group of ornithologists had questioned the announcement made in April of the rediscovery of the ivory billed woodpecker, last sighted in 1944.
They said blurry videotape of a bird in flight wasn't enough evidence.
So a Cornell University researcher who was part of the team that announced the bird's rediscovery last spring says his group sent the doubters more evidence.
"We sent them some sounds this summer from the Arkansas woods," said John W. Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell ornithology lab.
"We appreciate their ability to say they are now believers."
The doubters had prepared an article for a scientific journal questioning whether the bird had really been found.
They now plan to withdraw the article, according to ornithologist Richard Prum of Yale University, one of the doubters.
Prum said Tuesday he was particularly convinced by the Cornell researchers' two recordings of a series of nasally sounds that the ivory bills make and an exchange of double rap sounds between two birds.
He said the sounds matched recordings made in the 1930s in Louisiana.
"It's really on the basis of the new evidence that we've become convinced that the ivory billed woodpecker exists," Prum said in a telephone interview.
The recordings seem to indicate that there is more than one ivory billed woodpecker in the area.
"The bird that we saw had to have a mommy and a daddy," said Scott Simon, director of the Nature Conservancy in Arkansas.
"We have solid evidence for one.
We believe there are more."
Ornithologists announced in late April that an ivory billed woodpecker was living in a swamp in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in eastern Arkansas.
A Hot Springs kayaker had seen the bird a year earlier.
But Prum and fellow bird experts at Kansas and Florida Gulf Coast universities last month questioned the evidence, saying it was only strong enough only to suggest the possibility that the bird was present, not proof.
Another of those experts on Tuesday agreed with Prum.
"We were astounded.
Yes, I totally believe, thank goodness, there are ivory bills," Mark Robbins of the University of Kansas said in a telephone interview.
"We are ecstatic.
Once everybody hears these vocalizations, you can't help but be convinced."
The Cornell ornithologists made 17000 hours of recordings, using equipment set out in various places near the Cache and White rivers in Arkansas last winter.
One portion of the tapes has a distant double rap, followed closely by a double rap that is very close.
"It's communication typical of the ivory billed.
It's one of the more exciting cuts from the tape," Fitzpatrick said.
He said the audio had only recently been discovered on the tapes, which are being analyzed with computer assistance.
When the ornithologists announced in April that the bird had been found, the audio had not been reviewed closely enough, Fitzpatrick said.
"We thought it was premature in April to publish the analyses."
The Cornell researchers plan to release the audio publicly at the American Ornithologists' Union in Santa Barbara, Calif., Aug 23 27.
Three biologists are questioning the evidence used by a team of bird experts who made the electrifying claim in April that they had sighted an ivory billed woodpecker, a bird presumed to have vanished from the United States more than 60 years ago, in the swampy forests of southeast Arkansas.
If the challenge holds up, it would not only undermine a scientific triumph the rediscovery of a resplendent bird that had been exhaustively sought for years but also significant new conservation expenditures in the region.
The paper questioning the discovery has been provisionally accepted by a peer reviewed scientific journal, which could post the analysis on its Web site within a few weeks.
But the paper will be accompanied by a fierce rebuttal by the research team that announced the bird's discovery defending their claim, and a response to that rebuttal by the challengers.
The expected publication of the paper and the rebuttal was confirmed in interviews and e mail exchanges with two authors of the challenge, Richard O. Prum and Mark B. Robbins, ornithologists at Yale and the University of Kansas, as well as with two members of the team that reported finding the woodpecker.
The third author of the new paper is Jerome A. Jackson, a zoologist at Florida Gulf Coast University and the author of the book "In Search of the Ivory Billed Woodpecker," published in 2004.
The scientists on both sides of the issue declined to name the journal or to discuss the details of the challenge and the response until they are published.
But they made it clear that the debate revolves around four seconds of fuzzy videotape that, by chance, captured a bird with sweeping white and black wings as it darted from its perch on the far side of a tupelo tree in April 2004 and flicked over swampy waters before vanishing in the trees 11 wing beats later.
Everyone agrees that the bird that appears on the tape is either an ivory billed or a pileated woodpecker.
The team that conducted the original search for the bird ran extensive tests, including recreating the scene captured in video using flapping, hand held models of the two types of woodpecker.
They concluded that the plumage patterns seen in the grainy image could only be that of the ivory billed woodpecker.
The authors of the new paper disagree.
Only extended scientific discussion or new pictures of the bird from additional searches will determine whose view will prevail.
In the strongest published criticism yet of claims for the sighting of the ivory billed woodpecker in Arkansas in 2004, an ornithologist who was not involved in the search has called claims for proof of the bird's existence "faith based ornithology."
The ivory bill was, or is, the largest North American woodpecker.
It inhabited Southeastern forests that have been heavily logged, and the bird had been thought extinct, although occasional unconfirmed sightings have occurred often since the last confirmed one in the middle of the last century.
Then, in the spring of 2005, scientists announced that the bird had been found in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas, prompting a surge of elation among birders and the general public, and later a steady current of questions and skepticism.
Jerome A. Jackson, an ivory bill specialist at Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers, has now increased the intensity of the discussion in a 15 page article in the current issue of The Auk, a quarterly ornithology journal published by the American Ornithologists' Union.
In the article, Jackson writes of a "rush to publication" of the article in Science, published online in April 2005, that reported the 2004 sighting.
He also criticizes publicity about the sighting by conservation organizations and the Interior Department as the "selling" of the ivory bill and says the bird's existence has not been confirmed.
The strongest piece of evidence in the Science paper is a brief, blurry videotape that Jackson says shows a pileated woodpecker, not an ivory bill.
John W. Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, N.Y., coordinator of the search and announcer of the discovery of the ivory bill, said in an interview after he had read Jackson's article that he stood by the paper in Science.
Fitzpatrick said, "I have not yet seen any detailed scrutiny of the video that disproves our case."
He said that what "hurts the most" is Jackson's accusation that the Cornell Lab and other groups had been "selling" the ivory bill to promote conservation and that this effort had taken over the science.
"We've tried very hard not to oversell what we know," Fitzpatrick said.
The search is continuing at Cache River and the White River National Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas.
Fitzpatrick said the goal of the search, run by his lab, was to find a roost hole or evidence of a breeding pair.
"We are still waiting for the prize," he said.
"We have had a handful of moments when observers have seen what they are pretty sure is the bird.
We don't have the next big clue, which is a roost hole."
Jackson said in an interview: "I am in no way saying that ivory bills are not out there.
I really hope they are."
But he added that he had not yet seen convincing evidence.
Richard O. Prum, at Yale, another ornithologist who is not part of the Cornell Lab effort, said he was watching the search with great interest.
Last summer, he, Jackson and Mark B. Robbins of the University of Kansas wrote a critique of the Science paper.
They submitted it for publication and then withdrew it as other evidence of the ivory bill accumulated, although they remained critical of the evidence in Science.
"I think the ball is in their court," Prum said.
"I think they understand that to be universally accepted they're expected to find solid evidence and repeatable evidence of the bird this field season."
Scientists publicly presented recordings of the ivory billed woodpecker, noting that the tape suggests there might be more than one of the rare birds in an eastern Arkansas swamp.
Some ornithologists had challenged the announcement of the bird's rediscovery, made by a group of researchers in April.
The ivory billed woodpecker was thought to be extinct until it was spotted in the swamps of southeast Arkansas last year.
Skeptics said blurry videotape of a bird in flight wasn't enough evidence.
But many were won over after a team of Cornell University researchers sent doubters several recordings of sounds that suggested the bird's existence.
Wednesday marked the first time the audio was publicly played during the American Ornithologists' Union meeting in Santa Barbara.
"It is the best tangible evidence so far that there could be more than one ivory bill in the area," Russell Charif, a researcher at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, said in a statement.
Scientists said the sounds were similar to ivory bills.
One recording featured a series of distinctive nasally sounds that ivory bills make and another captured an exchange of double rap sounds, which may indicate two ivory bills communicating with each other.
Since the woodpecker's rediscovery, federal agencies have promised millions to help preserve the bird's eastern Arkansas habitat in and around the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge.
John Fitzpatrick, lab director, said the ornithologists played their recordings of the ivory bill woodpecker and then played recording of related species of woodpeckers in South and Central America for comparison.
Reaction from conference attendees seemed positive, Fitzpatrick said.
In the church of birds, where passions run high and prophets emerge from swamps and thickets with revelations, nothing can ruin a reputation like admitting that you have seen an ivory billed woodpecker.
Bobby Harrison, a large, gentle man with thinning hair and a soft Alabama drawl, knows this and can recite the casualties.
Consider John V. Dennis, one of Harrison's heroes.
He took the last accepted photograph of an ivory bill in Cuba in 1948.
But when he testified to seeing one in the Big Thicket area of southeast Texas in 1966, he was ridiculed.
Harrison is willing to take the risk.
He has had a major part in the most recent report that the ivory bill lives and now, after a period of acceptance and celebration, some scientists and birders are questioning the strength of the evidence, a videotape of a bird and eyewitness accounts.
What the critics want is an absolutely clear photograph and a bird that can be seen repeatedly by a variety of observers.
Three scientists have a paper in the works at the Public Library of Science challenging the report in Science.
No details have been released, but there are other signs of doubt.
David Allen Sibley, perhaps the most prominent American birder, and the author of highly popular field guides, said in an interview on Thursday that he had concluded that in the Science paper, "the evidence they've presented falls short of proof."
Sibley said he decided this independently of the three scientists who wrote the rebuttal, although he had been in contact with them.
Harrison said that he could not comment on an unpublished paper, but that he was confident in the finding, and welcomed a scientific discussion.
"I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner," Harrison said.
Even when it was common, the bird had a certain majesty and mystery.
For the last 50 years it has been a symbol of loss, and of human failure.
Most people were afraid to hope.
Pete Dunne, vice president of the New Jersey Audubon Society and a prolific author on birds, said he was one of many who thought the ivory bill was gone for good.
"If someone had said to me, what was more likely, the rediscovery of the ivory billed woodpecker or the Second Coming, unhesitantly I would have gone to the latter."
For half a century, bird watchers have longed for a glimpse of the ivory billed woodpecker, a bird long given up for extinct but recently rediscovered in Arkansas.
Now they may be able to hear it.
On Wednesday, at the annual meeting of the American Ornithologists' Union here, a Cornell researcher played newly recorded sounds that were believed to come from an ivory bill: a toy trumpet call sounding like the word "kent" and a double knock on wood, made when the woodpecker hammers a tree.
It was these sounds that persuaded some skeptics this month to withdraw a critical paper and state that they were now convinced of the bird's existence.
The sounds are online at the Web site of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology: www.birds.cornell.edu.
Russ A. Charif, a research biologist at the lab who played the sounds at the meeting, did not claim that they were conclusive proof of the bird's existence.
There is further analysis to do and more acoustical evidence to gather, Charif said.
But together with a blurred, heavily analyzed video, and personal sightings, the evidence for the bird's existence is now conclusive, he said.
John Fitzpatrick, the head of the Cornell lab, said after the presentation that the researchers were not retreating from their conclusion that at least one ivory bill existed in Arkansas, that it was the weight of the combined evidence that had convinced him.
The ivory billed woodpecker, the largest American woodpecker, starkly patterned in black, white and red, had acquired near mythical status as a reminder of lost Southern forests until it was sighted twice in February 2004 in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge.
Although other sightings had been made since the last documented one roughly 50 years ago in Louisiana none had been confirmed and accepted by ornithologists.
In 2004 an ivory bill was sighted by Timothy Gallagher of the Cornell lab and Bobby Harrison of Oakwood College in Huntsville, Ala., as they searched the Cache River refuge in a canoe.
Both men had been pursuing the bird for years and had gone to this area because of a report from Gene Sparling of Hot Springs, Ark., who thought he had seen it while kayaking earlier in the month.
The sighting by two expert birders led to an extensive but secret search and an announcement in April 2005 at a news conference and in an article in the journal Science that the bird had been found.
Serious doubts were later voiced by other ornithologists and birders, including Richard O. Prum of Yale University and Mark Robbins of the University of Kansas about the evidence presented in the Science paper.
But Prum and Robbins were convinced of the bird's existence after they were provided the recordings that Charif played on Wednesday.
The recordings were from the Cache River and the White River National Wildlife Refuges, and Prum and Robbins were still not convinced that the Science paper, which had not used the recordings as evidence, was conclusive.
But since the larger point was moot, they withdrew a critical response to that paper.
Charif said after his talk that the "kent" sounds alone were not conclusive because scientists could not completely rule out a blue jay mimicking the sound of an ivory bill, and that there was no earlier definitive recording of the double rap.
"Our interpretation is that they provide suggesting and tantalizing evidence," he said of the recordings.
"We regard the video as being conclusive," he said, even though it was the acoustic recordings that had persuaded skeptics who found the video analysis lacking.
The recordings were made from December 2004 to May 2005 with remote recording units in the Cache River and White River refuges.
The 18000 hours of recordings were combed, first by computer and then by humans, to pick out more than 50 double knocks and several "kent" calls.
These were more thoroughly analyzed and compared to known ivory bill recordings, and double knocks of similar species outside of the United States.
For ornithologists, it was the equivalent of finding Elvis, alive and well, singing his heart out in some isolated, rural shack.
Long feared extinct, the ivory billed woodpecker is now back in the building or in its case, a boggy woodland in Arkansas its return confirmed by audio recordings of the bird's distinctive call and tree rap.
The saga of the ivory bill's rediscovery in the United States the last confirmed sighting was more than 60 years ago is one of amateur sleuthing, professional rancour and sightings that reduced at least one hardened bird watcher to a sobbing wreck.
Scientific consensus on the bird's re appearance was finally reached this week when a prominent trio of sceptical academics withdrew their challenge to news of the discovery after listening to the sound recordings.
"It was extraordinary, chilling ,just stunning," said Richard Prum an ornithologist at Yale University who was one of the leading doubters.
"Listening to that tape would elicit goosebumps from anybody who cares about this bird," Prum told AFP.
The tape, which featured the sound of two ivory bills, headed off what was threatening to turn into a fully fledged academic bust up in the ornothological community.
The woodpecker's return was first trumpeted by a group of scientists in a paper they submitted to the journal Science in May, based on a series of sightings and analysis of a blurry, four second video.
Prum and two colleagues Mark Robbins, an ornithologist at Kansas University, and Jeremy Jackson, a zoologist at Florida Gulf Coast University found the evidence insufficient and submitted their own highly critical paper to that effect to the Public Library of Science.
"The reviewers complemented us on our tone.
The other authors did not," Prum acknowledged.
"I think they wish it had been done in a private way, but this was science and we wanted to take a formal route."
After listening to the audio recording, the dissenters withdrew their challenge.
"We didn't withdraw because we thought we'd made any mistakes, but because there was new evidence that made our script moot," Prum said.
The search for the ivory bill began in earnest after a one time shiitake mushroom farmer, Gene Sparling, spotted a woodpecker with the right markings while kayaking in February through a swamp in eastern Arkansas.
"I cannot yet explain or fully comprehend why something so wonderful happened, certainly not why something so wonderful happened to me," Sparling, 49, told AFP in a telephone interview.
Although confident of what he had seen, Sparling was, at first, wary of publicising his discovery.
"I knew if I went and told someone I'd be laughed at," he said.
"Even for me it was difficult to believe that a species that had been extinct my entire life wasn't extinct at all."
In the end he made a veiled reference to the sighting on a website, which was brought to the attention of Tim Gallagher, editor of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Living Bird magazine, and Bobby Harrison, an associate professor at Oakwood College in Alabama.
After interviewing Sparling, Gallagher and Harrison visited the swamp where, on February 27, they both saw what appeared to be an ivory bill in flight.
After independently sketching what they had seen, the two men compared notes and concluded the bird was indeed the legendary woodpecker.
"When we finished our notes," Gallagher wrote in an account of the sighting, "Bobby sat down on a log, put his face in his hands and began to sob, saying, 'I saw an ivory bill.
I saw an ivory bill'."
Gallagher said he was too choked with emotion to speak.
"Just to think this bird made it into the 21st century gives me chills.
It's like a funeral shroud has been pulled back, giving us a glimpse of a living bird, rising Lazarus like from the grave."
The following month saw the formation of a full scale search team, which documented further sightings and produced the brief video that formed the foundation of the Science article in May.
The rediscovery garnered national and international media attention, prompting concern that the woodpeckers habitat could be inundated with bird watchers.
"That's one of our biggest fears," said Morris, one of the converted dissenters.
"Could it become extinct because of people overrunning its place?
We lost this bird once, we don't want to do it again," Morris said.
Schools across New Hampshire have yanked junk food from the vending machines and reduced the fat in cafeteria lunches.
Now, nearly half of the state's schools are measuring whether students are truly eating healthier by the pound.
Twice a year, in more than 230 schools, students, from kindergarten through high school, step on a doctor's scale as part of a growing statewide effort to combat childhood obesity.
Volunteers calculate each child's Body Mass Index a measure of body fat based on height and age to see who's overweight or obese.
New Hampshire is taking the unusual step of tracking children's weight in school because the state's percentage of overweight children is greater than the national average.
Researchers hope to weigh students and test their physical fitness in all 500 schools in the state within the next two years, some schools began the weigh ins as a pilot last school year.
While some health professionals and parents like the idea, some students aren't so thrilled about stepping on a scale in school.
"We're trying to do this to show them their fitness level and deemphasize their body shape and size," said Dr Walter Hoerman, a pediatrician who led efforts in the Rochester, N.H., school system to improve children's health.
Rhode Island is the only other state pushing the same approach, said Tamara Martin, a University of New Hampshire professor and chairwoman of the state's Healthy Schools Task Force, a spinoff of a national effort.
Next month the Massachusetts Legislature is expected to take up a bill that would ban unhealthy vending machines from schools and require more physical education.
But the state has no plan to start weighing kids, said public health and school officials.
At the Rochester Middle School, students line up in the gym each fall and spring for their turn at the scale.
They also do sit ups, push ups, and pull ups as part of a battery of physical tests to measure their strength, endurance, and flexibility.
Students' weights are attached to identification numbers, not names.
But some students say they're self conscious about the process, because classmates become competitive.
"Other kids had to stand 5 feet away from the scale, and sometimes some of the kids have good eyesight where they can actually read the thing," said Sarah Prantis, a sixth grader at Rochester Middle School.
"All the kids were asking 'How much do you weigh?
How much do you weigh?'
But I didn't want to tell."
Prantis said the experience made her realize that she was out of shape and that she needed to lose weight.
She took swimming lessons over the summer and has since joined a swim team.
She also signed up for a daily health class elective where students learn about food groups and go on neighborhood walks.
Instead of coming home to eat, she now plays soccer with her three dogs, because she has more energy.
Parent Terry Desjardins, whose 10 year old daughter will enter Rochester Middle next fall, said she is grateful that the schools are making her children's health a priority.
"I know there are people who would say that's not the place of a school system, but I feel this is a teaching moment for a lifetime," said Desjardins, who enrolled her two daughters in a nutrition program sponsored by a local hospital.
"If we can get our kids to think about not just today but healthy habits five years from now, I'm all for that."
Hoerman, a father of three teenagers, said the middle school was careful not to put adolescents in an embarrassing situation and had debated using calipers to measure students' body fat.
The school decided against it, because the results are not always accurate, he said.
Plus, an adult would have to pinch children's fat to measure it.
Obesity contributes to 300000 deaths nationally every year, Hoerman said.
Childhood obesity can lead to problems later in life, including diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, and certain cancers, he said.
Obese refers to someone whose weight is about a quarter more than the maximum desirable for his or her height.
According to New Hampshire data collected since last school year, 18 percent of girls and 22 percent of boys in kindergarten through high school are overweight or obese, compared to the national average of 16 percent.
Health professionals say 5 percent of US youth should be labeled obese or overweight.
School systems nationwide are starting to re examine their food offerings and fitness programs, said Jean Schultz, a health specialist with the National Middle School Association.
They've tweaked their fund raisers, cutting out bake sales and candy sales.
But she warned that schools should tread carefully when it comes to weight.
"Some districts have tried to include a letter home saying 'Your son or daughter is X number of pounds over the norm' and that has not been well received," Schultz said.
"Parents were offended because they thought the schools were being invasive and not kind to their children.
The interest of the schools were to raise awareness at home, but kids who are in the middle level, like adults, are sensitive about how they look and how much they weigh."

The Sarasota Family YMCA is opening a new fitness room aimed at promoting exercise and healthy habits for kids.
The nation has identified childhood obesity as a critical public health epidemic and the YMCA has set aside space to help children combat the problem.
The exercise room for kids ages 7 to 13 features smaller versions of the fitness equipment used by adults.
Officials converted a conference room in the Bari Brooks Teen Center at the Frank G. Berlin Sr.
Branch on Euclid Avenue into the Youth Fitness Center, which opened in December.
The nonprofit organization spent $28000 on more than a dozen resistance and cardiovascular machines for the tricep, bicep, shoulder, back and leg muscles.
The young people have access to free weights and stability balls, and there is an area for stretching.
"We're giving them an atmosphere and environment that is kid friendly, with their music, equipment that is their size and quality instruction to try to teach them to begin adopting healthy lifestyles," said Pam Conner, fitness director of the Berlin branch.
The U.S. Surgeon General in 2001 issued a call to action to tackle the rise of childhood obesity.
Nine million children over age 6 are obese, according to health statistics.
Sarasota County schools provide time for physical education or personal fitness classes, said supervisor Rick Westover.
Most high schools have weight rooms, and some middle schools have upgraded their fitness areas, said Sue Pryer Bell, Sarasota Middle School's physical education teacher.
Research now shows that younger children can participate in fitness training other than sports, if taught how to do it correctly.
Wayne Westcott, a fitness expert in Massachusetts, said the benefits are stronger muscles and bones at an earlier age.
Fitness training can reduce common sports related injuries and help children with weight problems.

In the same week the government released new exercise and nutrition guidelines, food processors took steps to put themselves on the right side of the national campaign against obesity.
Companies rolled out new versions of popular items, such as Cocoa Puffs and chocolate syrup, that have less sugar and salt and offer more vitamins and whole grains.
Kraft Foods, maker of Oreos, Kool Aid and Oscar Mayer lunch meats, said it will curb radio and television advertising aimed at children under 12.
Even though the word is out that more children consume more calories than they burn, still the epidemic continues.
"We have an obesity epidemic.
One out of five children are obese," said Dan Remley, consumer and family science and community development educator for The Ohio State University Extension Office for Butler County.
"The problem with obesity is not cosmetic but a health issue."
Childhood obesity can plague children as young as 3 years old.
The cause of obesity often is attributed to genes, heredity, environment and behavior.
While some contributing factors cannot be changed, experts say children can adjust their attitudes to eating healthy and become physically active with the help of their parents.
"Prevention is the best intervention.
That's where parents can develop a family routine by limiting TV time.
The average child gets about six hours of TV including video games and being on the computer," said Shelly Frank, clinical dietitian with the HealthWorks! program and the Comprehensive Weight Management Center at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.
"It's a complicated picture of environment and behavior.
I do think there's an overall message of kids being inundated with commercials that parents may or may not know about."
According to the Centers for Disease and Prevention Control, an estimated 16 percent of children, ages 6 to 19 were overweight in a National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 1999 through 2002.
It represented a 45 percent increase from overweight estimates of 11 percent obtained by the survey from 1988 to 1994.
In Greater Cincinnati, 40 percent of children were overweight from a 1999 survey, according to Frank.
The American Obesity Association attributes causes to childhood obesity to: Lack of regular exercise, Sedentary behavior such as frequently watching TV, computer usage and similar behavior that can be used for physical activity, Socioeconomic status or low family incomes and nonworking parents, Eating habits including over consumption of high calorie foods.
Some eating patterns that have been associated with this behavior are eating when not hungry, eating while watching TV or while doing homework, Environment.
Overexposure to food advertisements that promote high calories and lack of recreational activities.
For nearly six years, HealthWorks! has offered a weight management program for children.
Children, referred by their physician to the program, learn healthy eating behaviors and ways to be physically active.
They are screened, monitored and educated by a nurse, dietitian, psychologist and physician.
About 200 children, ages 5 to 19, are enrolled in the program.
Remley facilitates the Butler County Healthy Living Coalition to determine incentives to get children and adults to become active.
He's also trained Ross High School students through a program called Student Wellness Activity Teams or SWAT.
The purpose is for high school students to educate elementary children to eat healthy and be active.
"This issue is not how long we're going to live but how well we're going to live," Remley said.

International health experts meeting in Norway on Wednesdat happen," Norum said.
Sugar consumption is skyrocketing around the world.
In the United States, each person consumes an average of the equivalent of "31 teaspoons of sugar" a day, or 20 percent more than the level consumed 20 years ago, Rigby said.
Studies conducted in 15 members of the European Union showed that obesity costs society between 75 and 130 billion euros annually, and that 72000 new cancer cases attributed to overweight are discovered each year.
In China, sugar now represents a third of the population's nutritional values, compared to 15 percent a decade ago.
Specialists currently recommend that people limit sugar consumption to "less than 10 percent" of their diet.
"If you're overconsuming sugar every extra unit increases the risk of having obese kids and those obese kids turn into obese adults who are on a slippery slope to serious health problems," Rigby said.
According to data provided by the experts, half of the sugar consumed by American children comes from sodas and other sugared drinks and a third comes from candy.
Schools, food makers, government agencies and families themselves must work together to reverse the epidemic of childhood obesity, a panel of scientists said Thursday.
The prestigious Institute of Medicine called Thursday for the wide ranging effort that includes less time in front of television and computer screens, changes in food labeling and advertising, more school and community physical education programs and education to help children make better choices.
"It is now critical to alter social norms and attitudes" so that healthy eating behavior and physical activity become a routine part of life, Dr Jeffrey Koplan of Emory University in Atlanta, chairman of the committee that prepared the recommendations, said Thursday at a briefing.
"This report is calling for fundamental changes in our society," Koplan said.
Dr Thomas N. Robinson of Stanford University said that many health care providers are worried about the future as obese children age and adult chronic diseases are beginning in the teen years and younger.
"Everything is affected by overweight," he said.
"I hope this finally serves as the wake up call we need to implement a comprehensive solution to this epidemic that is hitting every corner of America," said Sen Tom Harkin who has pushed legislation and research to improve school lunches and other dietary measures to fight childhood obesity.
The report from the IOM, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, is the latest to focus on the sharp increase in childhood obesity.
Over the last 30 years the rate of childhood obesity has tripled among youngsters aged 6 to 11 and has doubled for those aged 2 to 5 and 12 to 19, the institute reported.
"Obesity may be a personal issue, but at the same time, families, communities and corporations all are adversely affected by obesity and all bear responsibility for changing social norms to better promote healthier lifestyles," added Koplan, former director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Obesity can lead to increased likelihood of developing diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep problems, high cholesterol, gallstones and other problems.
"Things have changed ,pushing kids to eat more and be less active," observed Dr Stephen R. Daniels of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.
"It's very clear that the solution is not in any one place," said Daniels, of the hospital's comprehensive weight management center.
"Ultimately the major approach to this is prevention ,we have to start early," he said, urging cooperation of family, community, schools and industry.
Specifically, the panel suggested that parents to limit kids' TV hours, that schools provide healthier food, that restaurants offer nutrition information and that communities provide more recreation opportunities.
On Tuesday, three U.S. Cabinet secretaries fanned out across the country to promote healthier lifestyles, especially among young people.
"The cities have got to set aside (safe) places for kids to get outside and walk or even ride their bicycles," said Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson.
Also on the road promoting healthier lifestyles were Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman, Surgeon General Richard Carmona and Education Secretary Rod Paige.
The IOM report calls for increased federal involvement, including creation of an interdepartmental task force to coordinate activities, developing nutrition standards for school food, setting guidelines for advertising and marketing to children and increases in research funding.
And it seconds Thompson's call for increased recreational facilities, urging state and local governments and schools to expand opportunities for physical activity, including providing more facilities and more frequent and intense after school programs.
Urban and suburban community designs that discourage walking and other physical activities, such as communities without sidewalks, are among the causes of the increase in youth obesity, the report said.
Other causes cited included increased use of convenience foods that are high in fat and calories, less physical activity in school and more leisure time spent in front of televisions and computer screens instead of playing outdoors.

We can see your eyes rolling already, but bear with us: Should an inactive child use a personal trainer to become more fit and healthy?
Time was, that question might have seemed ludicrous.
But in an era of overworked (and under fit) parents, justifiable desires to keep kids from roaming neighborhood parks solo, ubiquitous butt bound digital entertainment and a habitat loaded with high calorie treats, today's kids increasingly are tomorrow's chronic disease statistics.
Approximately 30 percent of children ages 6 to 19 are overweight and 15 percent are obese, according to the American Obesity Association.
And child obesity predicts adult obesity with frightening accuracy.
But a personal trainer?
A $50 to $70 an hour luxury most of us don't even allow ourselves?
"We may lose a generation to obesity and diabetes," said Rich Salke, owner of Rich Bodies, a gym in Georgetown.
Salke works with many children, fat and fit alike, as young as 10.
Even well intentioned parents might lack the knowledge and community resources to rescue their children from the express lane to obesity, Salke said.
Other experts, including some who have no vested interest in kids' training, agree.
"The exercise professional who should have the greatest impact on public health (for children) is the personal trainer," said Walter Thompson, a kinesiology and nutrition professor at Georgia State University and an expert on personal trainer programs.
"If parents see that their child is overweight, they should consider" personal training, Thompson said.
He and others say children as young as 7 or 8 could start working with trainers.
Trainers can help kids who don't enjoy organized sports or are embarrassed doing active things with fitter kids.
You can use body mass index (BMI) to determine if your child is overweight or obese.
(Find a child BMI calculator at www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/bmi for age.htm.)
But Steven Horowitz, Maryland director of the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) and director of Velocity Sports Performance in Rockville, Md., has a simpler method: "It's pretty obvious when your kid tries to run down the block or up stairs.
If they cannot do that (because they get winded), you have a big problem."
So, okay, maybe a trainer could help your child.
But won't kids get bored by the follow the clipboard around the gym routine?
Yes, said Salke.
He frames exercises as games to keep kids interested and having fun.
One routine involves hanging a rope from the ceiling and testing kids to jump up and touch it, first with one hand, then the other.
"That builds quad power and coordination, and they love it," he said.
He has kids hurl stability balls at the ground to see how high they'll bounce, and jump back and forth over a band stretched between two points.
Salke works with individual kids and small groups, including sibling pairs.
Salke and Thompson agree that the training must be fun for the kids and that parents should pick trainers experienced with children and certified by NSCA or the American College of Sports Medicine (no group yet certifies in pediatric training).
Insist on talking to parents of other child clients.
"This can be expensive," Thompson said, "but so is the loss of income and wealth when the child becomes ill with a lifestyle related disease like Type 2 diabetes, heart disease or cancer."
Vanessa Jones' oldest child was regularly falling asleep to the television, and her youngest begged to go to Dairy Queen to get a toy advertised on TV.
Jones, a stay at home mother,, responded by banning television except on weekends.
She and her friends are increasingly concerned about children's television the commercials, the programming and the fact that kids are just sitting there instead of playing.
This weekend they are getting some help from an unlikely source: Nickelodeon, the No.1 network for children, is replacing its usual Saturday afternoon lineup with a message encouraging young viewers to go outside and play.
The move by Nick comes at a time when networks face a backlash over the potentially negative impacts of TV viewing.
High profile reports have linked television watching to childhood obesity, for example.
That has left children's networks including the No. 2 player Cartoon Network with a tricky balancing act.
After all, their revenue models depend on children watching plenty of television, which includes commercials for junk food.
They also make money when they package their characters with food products, such as Kraft's SpongeBob SquarePants macaroni and cheese, featuring the Nickelodeon character.
Marva Smalls, executive vice president for public affairs at Nickelodeon, acknowledged that awareness about childhood obesity is up, but said the network's initiatives were not a response to outside pressure.
"What's good for kids is good for business," she said.
In addition to today's programming hiatus in which there will be no kids' shows from noon to 3 p.m. Nick has sponsored "Let's Just Play" events across the country, and is awarding grants to schools to expand physical play.
The network also is working on a policy to require food products featuring Nickelodeon characters to have additional nutritional information on packaging.
The network says it will not lose significant revenue today, because it can shift the schedule to air commercials at other times.
However, Nickelodeon is investing tens of millions of dollars on the overall campaign, Smalls said.
Competitors are likely to follow suit.
The Cartoon Network, owned by Turner Broadcasting System, said it plans to roll out its own program targeting childhood obesity soon.
"We are working on a long term program to deal with this issue but we don't have all of the elements in place," said spokeswoman Laurie Goldberg.
Some critics are skeptical about how effective the networks' efforts will be.
"If they really want to address childhood obesity, they would stop marketing junk food to kids," said Susan Linn, author of "Consuming Kids: The Hostile Takeover of Childhood" and associate director of the media center at Judge Baker Children's Center in Boston.
"I think what they are concerned about is regulation," she said.
Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, expects media companies' efforts to be "measured and just enough to keep the government and courts off their backs."
But Jones applauds Nickelodeon for today's effort.
"Having something like that, if they are willing to make a sacrifice even for three hours, that makes me willing to put up with some of the other things," she said.
Cynthia Ziegler, a mother of two, said, "At least they are doing something."
Ziegler allows her 7 year old daughter and 8 year old son to watch television only on weekends.
A number of high profile reports about the media's role in childhood obesity have been issued in the last year, including: The Institute of Medicine this week published a report commissioned by Congress that called for more voluntary industry regulation of marketing to children.
The American Psychological Association issued a report in February, saying marketing to kids under 9 is inherently deceptive.
A Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation report, also released in February, suggested a variety of actions, from reducing the time children spend with television to increasing the media messages promoting fitness and sound nutrition.
The Center for Science in the Public Interest came out with a report in November 2003 that claims excessive television viewing contributes to childhood obesity and calls for stricter regulations on advertising.
In Congress, several pieces of legislation aiming to limit marketing to children have been proposed.
And more litigation is likely, said John Banzhaf, a law professor at George Washington University and a proponent for using the courts to make industry more responsible on childhood obesity issues.
At a conference this summer on obesity litigation, sponsored by the Public Health Advocacy Institute, Banzhaf heard discussion about suing media companies that air misleading junk food commercials, as well as the food companies themselves.
"If we could go after Nickelodeon, the impact would be greater" than winning lawsuits against food companies, he said.
Smalls acknowledged that Nickelodeon is in the business of selling advertising.
"Ice cream, candy, cookies are a part of kids' lives," the network executive said.
However, Nickelodeon also is committed to providing nutritional information to families, she said, on television as well as its Web site, magazines and sponsored local events.

New Zealand's government ordered schools on Tuesday to ensure children take extra physical education in a bid to fight growing obesity.
Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced that the nation's children would have to undertake one extra hour of physical activity every week on top of what they already do as part of their school's curriculum.
Mallard said he had been concerned to see physical activity among young New Zealand children falling and obesity on the rise.
He was proposing a change in education regulations so that schools treated physical activity as a priority.
As a result of the changes he said each child would take part in "at least one hour of meaningful and high quality physical activity a week".
Both state and private schools have physical education on their curriculum, although it ranges from very little activity in some schools to intensive programmes in others.
The move was prompted by research showing 31 percent of New Zealand children are either overweight or obese and that more and more are leading sedentary lives 13 percent of five to 17 year olds in 2001 compared with eight percent in 1997.
Labeling Shrek cereal by General Mills and a promotional children's book that features Kraft's Oreo cookies as extreme examples of marketing to children, Sen Tom Harkin issued a sharp rebuke on Wednesday to the nation's largest food companies.
Harkin, D Iowa, criticized the food industry for contributing to childhood obesity by spending $10 billion last year on marketing to children much of it, he said, to promote sugary and nutritionally deficient products.
He called on food companies to do more to limit what they advertise to children.
Harkin also said that he intended to introduce a bill that would give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to regulate advertising to children.
Currently, the commission has greater authority over advertising aimed at adults.
"I sincerely hope that the industry will develop tough and effective marketing guidelines," Harkin, a member of the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services Committee, said.
"But when private interests work against the public good like this, government is obliged to act." He was joined on Wednesday by several critics of the food industry Marketing to children has become a major issue for the $500 billion food industry.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of overweight children in the United States has doubled in two decades, and 15 percent of American children are overweight or obese.
Type II diabetes, which is linked to excess body weight, is being found in such high numbers among children that it can no longer be referred to as adult onset diabetes.
Two months ago, Kraft Foods announced that it would stop television advertising of certain products it considers unhealthy to children under 12.
Kraft will not reduce its $90 million a year worth of advertising aimed at children.
Rather, it will alter the product mix, increasing ads for Sugar Free Kool Aid and 100 calorie packs of thin crisp Oreos.
Many in the food and advertising industries say that advertising is not a factor in obesity or diabetes.
They focus on lack of exercise as the primary cause of America's childhood obesity problems.
Dan Mindus, a senior analyst at the Center for Consumer Freedom, an organization funded by food and restaurant companies and various individuals, pointed to an analysis of Census data done at the University of North Carolina.
Researchers there found that from 1980 to 2000, caloric intake among adolescents had risen 1 percent while physical activity has declined by 13 percent.
"Senator Harkin would be well served to focus his energies on getting more PE back into schools," Mindus said.
In an effort to promote physical activity, McDonald's last week announced a global marketing campaign featuring athletes and information about a "balanced lifestyle."
Michael Jacobson of the Centers for Science in the Public Interest said that exercise was being used by the food industry as a way to distract people from the inconvenient fact that many of the food products aimed at children are nutritionally deficient and have too many calories.
"Companies are taking a pot of white flour and a pot of refined sugar and adding maybe some fat and food coloring and flavoring and calling it food, but it's basically junk," said Jacobson, whose organization is funded primarily by subscribers to its newsletter.
A full table of food aimed at children was on display in Harkin's office Wednesday.
Holding up a box with the Shrek character emblazoned across the front, Harkin dug out a magnifying glass to read a description of what was inside.
"Kids just see that it's Shrek," he said.
The product was General Mills' Shrek cereal, or sweetened corn puffs with marshmallow pieces, containing 14 grams of sugar per serving.
Representatives at General Mills did not comment on Harkin's criticisms.
A Kraft spokesman, Mark Berlind, said the company was looking at the issue of licensed characters on packaging, but had no plans to make any changes at the moment.
High fructose corn syrup isn't completely responsible for the nation's six million overweight children but Dr George Bray says it's a big part of the problem.
Nurture trumps nature in the current childhood obesity epidemic, says Bray.
It's the environment we're creating for our kids that's the problem, and that environment includes increasing numbers of products high in high fructose corn syrup, or HFCS.
Bray, who served as founding president of the North American Association for the Study of Obesity and organized the first international congress on obesity in 1973, points out that between 1970 (when HFCS was introduced) and 2000 (when average yearly consumption of the ultra sweet liquid sugar hit 73.5 pounds per person in this country), the prevalence of obesity more than doubled, from 15 percent to almost one third of the adult population.
And worse, much worse, obesity among children 12 to 19 who consume a disproportionate amount of the soft drinks, fruit juice, sports drinks and packaged cookies and other baked goods that are sweetened with HFCS increased from 4.2 percent in 1970 to 15.3 percent in 2000.
The implications for our children's future are clear: "We know that if it's not caught early, one in three of these overweight children will grow into overweight adults at increased risk for type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke and early death," Bray said at a SS presentation for doctors and nurses at Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth last month.
But there is hope.
Obesity is largely preventable through changes in lifestyle, especially diet, says Bray, who called for removing soda machines from schools and reducing portion sizes of commercially available sodas in his now famous commentary in "T""he American Journal of Clinical Nutrition" in April, 2004.
Larger portions, more high fat fast foods, less exercise of any kind, irregular sleep patterns, lower consumption of milk and other high calcium foods, and increased consumption of HFCS in beverages go a long way toward explaining the obesity epidemic, Bray says.
"Genetic factors play an important role in the development of obesity, but given the rapidity with which the current epidemic of obesity has descended on the U.S. and many other countries, environmental factors are a more likely explanation," he says.
"Whatever its genetic and biochemical determinants, obesity in man is susceptible to an extraordinary degree of control of social factors.
Environment is very important."
Bray says the problem with HFCS is not only that it is sweeter than other forms of sugar, but also that it does not affect appetite.
Fructose adds to overeating because it does not trigger chemical messengers that tell the brain the stomach is full and no longer hungry, like food and drinks that contain regular refined sugar do.
An internist whose pioneering research helped establish the connections between weight gain and the development of type 2 diabetes, Bray is a research professor and former director of the Pennington Center at Louisiana State University, the largest nutritional research center in the world.
He says consumers would be a lot better off without added sugar in any form, but that artificial sweeteners are much preferred over calorically sweetened drinks, even for children.
"Children less than 5 probably shouldn't have any sweetened drinks, and for older children, diet drinks are better than regular soft drinks and fruit drinks," Bray said.
"A lot of parents are concerned about the 'chemicals' added to sweeten diet soft drinks, but all forms of extra added sugar and artificial sweeteners are bad.
We don't need added sugar in our diet."
Bray says parents should be in charge of diets, children should be in charge of their own exercise activities, and perhaps government should regulate portion sizes.
Kids should be required to be active a certain amount of time each day, but after you tell them to turn off the TV and get moving, you should let them decide if they want to go outside and play with friends, ride bikes, swim, play ball, skate, play tennis, go shopping or whatever, as long as they are moving.
When parents require children to "work out" or "exercise," the children are more likely to stop moving altogether as soon as they get away from home, Bray says.
He is calling for improved packaging and labeling for food meant to be consumed as a single serving.
Too many ready to eat foods and drinks are labeled as single servings but packaged as two or even three servings.
"It's hard to find a single serving soft drink," he said.
"Portion size is something government (BEGIN BRACKET)the Food and Drug Administration(END BRACKET) can and should do something about."

WITH BC HEALTH CHILD OBESITY TEX Fitness facts On Bray's list of the things people can do to prevent childhood (and adult) obesity: Get more sleep.
(Lack of sleep has a bad effect on leptin, a hormone responsible for appetite control.
Major new studies in Japan and Germany show that the fewer hours a child sleeps, the greater the prevalence of obesity.)
Decrease sedentary activities.
(Limit TV and computer time, and replace at least one hour of inactivity with any combination of favorite activities, every day.)
Drink more milk.
(Calcium is clearly important to weight control.)
Drink fewer sweetened beverages.
(Even fruit drinks and diet soft drinks should be limited, but especially cut down on regular carbonated soft drinks.)
Get as much of your sugar as possible from whole fruits.
(Think blueberries, strawberries and bananas to sweeten breakfast cereals, apples and oranges for dessert.)
Think portion control, even with healthy foods.
(Serve less on the plates, and allow for seconds.)
Get everyone in the family to eat breakfast.
(Have hot or cold cereal most days.
Bray eats a lot of oatmeal.)
Don't smoke, especially if you're pregnant.
(Recent studies show that intrauterine exposure to inhaled smoke produces a dose dependent increase in the weight of children, beginning at adolescence.)
Former US president Bill Clinton went to a Manhattan school Tuesday to announce a 10 year initiative to combat childhood obesity.
Clinton, who is recovering from quadruple bypass surgery and had to overcome his affinity for junk food, described the weight problem as a national epidemic and stressed that something had to be done to change the eating habits of America's young people.
The initiative, a partnership with the American Heart Association, will include working with the food and restaurant industry to promote change, increasing physical activity and nutrition at schools nationwide, said the former president.
The initiative also aims at creating a campaign to engage kids in making better choices and providing their parents with information on how to incorporate heart healthy activities and diets into their family routines.
"I feel so strongly about this," said Clinton, whose interest in the subject stems from his recent heart surgery.
He said he was alerted by the substantial numbers of children with so called adult onset diabetes, simply due to their eating and exercise habits.
Recent reports indicate that nearly half of the city's elementary students are overweight.
More than twice as many kids are overweight as in 1980, and overweight children and teens have a 70 percent chance of becoming overweight adults.
Lawmakers think Texas schoolchildren better shape up, and they don't just mean in reading, writing and arithmetic.
These kids need to lose some weight.
Citing childhood obesity as a serious problem, bills in the Legislature propose increasing the required physical education classes from three times a week to five times a week for students in kindergarten through ninth grade.
"If we don't make them healthier when they're young, it's very hard to reverse that when they're older," said state Rep Martha Wong, R Houston, who wrote House Bill 2785.
State Sen Jane Nelson, R Lewisville, filed similar legislation, Senate Bill 42.
"We are starting to see the consequences of de emphasizing basic health and nutrition in our schools in the form of chronic diseases caused by obesity and illness," Nelson said.
"We only get one body in this lifetime, and we need to make sure that our children know how to take care of it."
Becky Watts, spokeswoman for the Illinois State Board of Education, said Illinois is the only state that requires daily physical activity for public school students.
But government is increasingly recognizing obesity as a health threat.
The Internal Revenue Service made weight loss treatment tax deductible in 2002, and last year, Medicare officially recognized obesity as a disease and started evaluating which weight loss treatments the program would cover.
Wong said that she has a lot of support for her bill requiring more physical education but that she's heard some concerns from middle school officials who already have a tight schedule.
Cecil Floyd, the association's executive director, said many middle schools reduced physical education because the Legislature required them to do so much else.
"There's just a whole lot of courses being required at the middle school, and there's just no time to offer other classes," he said.
But Floyd agrees that children need more exercise.
One out of three Texas schoolchildren is overweight or severely overweight, according to the Texas Department of Agriculture.
It's a serious problem, said Judith Stern, vice president of the American Obesity Association, in Washington, D.C. "They can be setting up a pattern for life," she said.
"If a fat kid becomes a fat adolescent, they're more than likely to become a fat adult."
State Rep Ryan Guillen, D Rio Grande City, filed a bill to make sure schools don't cheat on meeting their physical education requirements.
House Bill 517 forbids schools to count time spent walking to and from class and the school bus as physical activity.
Other bills address obesity, such as Senate Bill 205, which would put students' body mass index on their report cards.
Senate Bill 1379 encourages more stringent school nutrition policies than the federal government demands Lisa Wheeler, the P.E. teacher at Oaklawn Elementary School in Fort Worth, said her school has physical education classes five times a week, and she tries to make it count because students don't seem to have the energy or stamina they had when she started teaching 15 years ago.
"It seems like before, they had been a lot more active,They tend to stay inside, and when they stay inside they tend to watch TV, play video games and eat junk food," Wheeler said.
Rene Walker, a Fort Worth mother, said she sees the same problem with her children.
Her youngest is in high school, and she has to encourage him to eat better and stay active.
"Oh God, it's chips and Coke, I swear that's all he eats," she said.
"I have to kick him out the door periodically because all he wants to do is watch TV and play video games."
But the system is also to blame, she said, because children are required to stay at their desks in school for so much testing.
"I think parents feel like there is a lot of emphasis on testing and performing well in school, and there's so much pressure on the kids," said Walker, who is president of the Fort Worth Council of PTAs.
"When you're sitting in a desk all day and you don't have much release, that's very stressful for kids."

Sweets, carbonated drinks, sweetened milk and fatty foods will be banned from 433 schools across the Thai capital this semester to tackle sugar consumption and obesity, a report said Tuesday.
The ban follows reports that 25 percent of students are obese, Bangkok Metropolitan Authority deputy governor Pensri Pichaisanit told the Nation newspaper.
Fresh fruit and fruit juices would replace the sweet and fatty foods, while the only milk distributed to schools would be fresh, Pensri said.
Schools with contracts with food distribution companies would need to discuss the ban with education authorities, she said.
The ban supports an anti sweets campaign by the Paediatrics Society of Thailand to reduce the numbers of children hooked on sugar, which can lead to diabetes and obesity.
Health officers would inspect students' teeth and weight and report any improvements to authorities, Pensri said.
Television advertising strongly influences what children under 12 eat, and popular cartoon characters should be used to promote only healthy foods, a panel of scientists said in a report released Tuesday.
The report by the Institute of Medicine said the food industry should spend its marketing dollars on nutritious food and drinks.
"The foods advertised are predominantly high in calories and low in nutrition the sort of diet that puts children's long term health at risk," said J. Michael McGinnis, a senior scholar at the institute and chairman of the report committee.
The report said evidence is limited on whether TV advertising leads to obesity in children.
A study hasn't been done that would demonstrate a direct cause and effect.
Still, the panel found the evidence compelling enough to call for a concerted effort to change the nature of foods being marketed to children, said panel member Ellen A. Wartella, psychology professor at the University of California, Riverside.
The growth in new food products targeted to kids has been huge, from 52 introduced in 1994 to nearly 500 introduced last year, the report said.
"Overwhelmingly, those foods are high calorie, low nutrient foods, not the kind of foods that are recommended for children to eat," Wartella said.
The findings were no surprise to Iowa Sen Tom Harkin, who requested the report.
"We like to think that SpongeBob SquarePants and Shrek and the pretty little princesses are likable, kid friendly characters, but they're being used to manipulate vulnerable children to make unhealthy choices," said Harkin, the senior Democrat on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee.
"The industry must stop pushing junk food on our kids," Harkin said.
Nickelodeon in October announced a campaign aimed at persuading kids to eat healthy foods and to get up off the couch and move.
The campaign features former President Bill Clinton and the cartoon characters SpongeBob SquarePants and Dora the Explorer.
Among children and adolescents from ages 6 through 19, obesity rates have tripled over the past 40 years.
Obesity increases the risks of type 2 diabetes and many other diseases and health conditions.
The food and beverage industries argue that they already are taking steps recommended in the report, making products healthier, shrinking package sizes and touting healthy lifestyles.
"The growth in the food and beverage industry is in healthier foods," said Richard Martin, spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers Association.
"There's been a sea change in the last couple of years, and I don't think that's very well reflected in this report."
The panel assessed hundreds of studies, then reviewed evidence from 123 of them and completed the most comprehensive review to date on the scientific evidence of how food marketing affects kids' diets.
The food served in California schools will be healthier under legislation signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
The new laws impose a campus ban on the sale of sodas, set a new nutritional standard for vending machine snacks, and require more fruits and vegetables in meal planning.
The former bodybuilding champion and fitness expert said the new rules are all part of a new effort to fight childhood obesity.
"California is facing an obesity epidemic," Schwarzenegger said Thursday at a conference on childhood obesity.
"And more and more, children are becoming part of the problem."
Lawmakers made California the first state in the nation to ban the sale of soft drinks in middle and elementary schools two years ago.
One of the bills signed by the governor Thursday will expand that ban to include high schools.
Beginning in July 2007, students will be allowed to buy only water, milk, and some fruit and sport drinks that have limited sweeteners.
The governor also signed a bill that will raise nutritional standards for foods sold in school vending machines and regulate the number of calories that can come from fat and sugar.
It also takes effect in July 2007.
Another bill provides $18.2 million (euro14.9 million) during this fiscal year to offer more fruits and vegetables in school meal programs.
The California bills set a new standard nationally for healthy school foods, according to the Washington D.C. based Center for Science in the Public Interest.
"Coke, Pepsi and other junk food marketers enjoy being in schools because they know it is one of the only places they can target kids without parental interference," said Margo Wootan, the center's nutritional policy director said in a statement.
"But in California, parents have clearly had enough, and leaders of both parties took notice," she said.
Susan Neely, president of the American Beverage Association, called the ban on sodas "unnecessary" and said that students and parents would have been better served by a voluntary program.
"We believe this complex problem would be more effectively addressed by educating students on the importance of living a balanced lifestyle," Neely said in a statement.
When Ronald McDonald appeared in a new TV ad in June, outfitted in a sporty version of his trademark yellow suit, snowboarding and skateboarding, even juggling fruit, the popular icon for the fast food giant seemed to be having something of an identity crisis.
There were no French fries and no sign of the Hamburglar or Mayor McCheese.
Suddenly, the clown faced character who once thrived in the land of milkshake volcanoes and apple pie trees was being described by company marketing executives as "an ambassador for a balanced, active lifestyle" and "a powerful force for good."
This makeover, McDonald's officials say, is just the beginning.
Nearly every aspect of the company's new marketing strategy centers on health.
The home of the Big Mac now claims to be America's No. 1 distributor of apples, thanks to its new Apple Dippers, slices served with caramel sauce, and a new Fruit & Walnut salad a bowl of apples, grapes and yogurt advertised in Vogue magazine with illustrations of lithe young women.
There's a new line of "premium" salads (17 types of lettuce!) and chicken sandwiches.
Customers can now substitute bottled water and apple slices for soft drinks and fries or skip the bun and get a lettuce wrapped burger.
McDonald's also has hired as consultants Oprah Winfrey's personal trainer Bob Greene and best selling author and nutritionist Dr Dean Ornish of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, Calif., to help design fitness programs and promote good eating habits.
A new line of McDonald's skateboards and bikes is in the works, and there's a new "Bag a McMeal" Web site (http://app.mcdonalds.com/bagamcmeal) that calculates the nutritional value of any McDonald's meal.
"Stay tuned," says Bridget Coffing, a McDonald's spokeswoman.
"There's more to come."
McDonald's campaign signals a major shift in marketing that, if successful, could help redefine fast food.
If this global behemoth can effectively sell consumers on its healthier menu, competing chains such as Burger King and Carl's Jr. will likely follow.
Just last weekend, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Health and Human Services held a two day forum to look at childhood obesity and the effect of fast food marketing on kids.
The real challenge is to convince the public that McDonald's, which a half century ago pioneered the quick serve genre commonly derided as "junk food," is now the place to go for good nutrition.
So far, the 2 year old campaign shows signs of success.
McDonald's says that it has boosted business by nearly 2 million customers a day since 2002 and that worldwide sales in restaurants open at least one year jumped 6.9 percent last year.
Ornish, a well regarded researcher in heart disease prevention, brought credibility to the campaign when he publicly praised the company for promoting good health.
Even one of McDonald's harshest critics, Bob McCannon, director of the New Mexico Media Literacy Project, a media activism group that trains elementary and high school educators, has granted the fast food giant grudging praise, saying "there's some value to promoting activity."
McDonald's stops short of linking the campaign to the obesity epidemic in the United States.
And it has rejected the idea that it was influenced by filmmaker Morgan Spurlock's 2004 documentary "Super Size Me," which detailed the health problems he experienced after eating an all McDonald's diet for 30 days.
In interviews, company representatives shied away from portraying the marketing campaign as a change in direction for the company.
"The things that we're doing are nothing new," says Ken Barun, McDonald's senior vice president of social responsibility.
"It's been about choice, variety and quality for us for a long time."
McDonald's has offered nutritional information and food exchange lists for diabetics and dieters since the 1970s and has sponsored sporting events for decades.
Salads were introduced in 1986 and, in the 1990s, the company launched a nutritional campaign for children and added a nutrition section to its Web site.
Still, some marketing analysts and nutrition experts are skeptical that enough McDonald's customers will order a salad when tempted by the smell of cheeseburgers and fries.
They also question whether the company can be successful by, in effect, having it both ways keeping its burger loving customers happy while hawking yogurt and salads.
"There are aspects of what they're doing that I think are very helpful, which I think will make it easier for Americans to eat well," says Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington, D.C., a nonprofit health advocacy group and critic of the fast food industry.
"Some other aspects of their efforts, I think, are really more about marketing than about promoting Americans' health and physical activity."
For 50 years, McDonald's has primarily counted on burgers and fries to drive its revenue and fuel its expansion to 119 countries.
Although Americans have long had a love hate relationship with fast food, growing concerns over health issues now pose a seemingly larger threat to the chain's strategy.
As the nation's childhood obesity rate continued to soar, doubling and tripling among elementary and middle school students during the last 30 years, McDonald's became a target of critics.
McDonald's, charges Dave Morris, a longtime critic of the chain, is "continuing to contribute to the serious, long term health crisis of Western populations and increasingly throughout the world, wherever fast food chains are spreading and undermining traditional cuisine."
With Helen Steel, Morris was involved in a 10 year libel lawsuit that centered on McDonald's marketing practices in the United Kingdom.
In 1997, a judge ruled in favor of McDonald's, which had accused the two activists of libeling the company.
But the judge also found that Morris and Steel had proved, among other things, that McDonald's misled consumers by advertising its food as healthy and exploited children with its marketing strategy.
A 2001 study published in the International Journal of Obesity found that adolescents who ate fast food three times a week consumed up to 40 percent more calories than those who did not.
In 2002, two teenagers from the Bronx borough of New York filed a class action lawsuit against McDonald's, blaming the chain for making them fat.
(The case was dismissed, then, in January, it was revived by a federal appeals court.
A McDonald's spokesman has called the suit "frivolous.")
In late 2004, a 15 year study published in the British medical journal the Lancet suggested that fast food increased the risk of obesity and Type 2 diabetes.
At the same time, the company faced challenges from other fast food chains and the mad cow disease scare.
After more than a year of sluggish sales that concluded with the company's first ever quarterly loss, McDonald's began to implement change in 2002.
It started gradually.
The company promised to use oil with lower levels of trans fatty acids and saturated fat.
The Fruit 'n Yogurt Parfait was expanded to all its restaurant location menus, and the company enhanced its Web site, enabling customers to track the nutritional values of any combination of McDonald's foods.
"We set out three major pillars: menu choice and quality of our products, education on nutrition and balance, and physical activity," Barun says.
With this came Winfrey's trainer Greene, entree sized "Premium Salads" featuring Paul Newman dressings and the white meat Chicken McNuggets.
The company announced it was directing its beef and chicken suppliers to phase out the use of growth promoting antibiotics.
A more globally focused nutrition director was appointed, along with an advisory council of nutritionists, pediatricians and Jackie Joyner Kersee, among others.
In early 2004, as the buzz was building for Spurlock's "Super Size Me," company officials arranged a news conference at the National Press Club to announce a new slogan: "Balanced Active Lifestyles ,it's what I eat and what I do."
While the new campaign is clearly relevant to Americans seeking more healthful food, the question remains whether they'll go to McDonald's for that good nutrition.
"The last time they tried to sell salads, nobody bought them because nobody goes there for that," says Deborah Cohn, professor of marketing at Yeshiva University's Sy Syms School of Business.
"What really works for them is hamburgers."
THE GROCERY Manufacturers Association is fighting the imposition of strong state standards requiring healthy foods to be served in Massachusetts schools.
Many systems in the state already encourage healthy eating, and the Legislature should pass a law to make sure that all do.
The national association of food and beverage companies opposing this worthy idea insists that communities ought to have a choice about whether to keep offering foods that tend to promote obesity.
But students are young, and schools ought to guide them toward good eating habits, not just provide them a smorgasbord.
Besides, obesity is not a personal matter, it often becomes a health problem for society at large.
"Restrictions do not educate," said the association in written testimony.
But they do, if accompanied by instruction in good nutrition and if the food is well prepared so healthy eating becomes a pleasant experience at an early age.
Sheila Parisien, director of food services in the Manchester Essex district, favors education in proper nutrition but says schools need to go beyond that.
"We have got to practice what we preach," she said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"The kids are going to be taught to make the cafeteria classroom connection."
Parisien said many districts have already improved their offerings to include more fresh fruits and vegetables and fewer starches and sweets.
She points to her own Manchester Essex district, as well as Gloucester, Somerville, Milton, Boston, and Worcester.
What's good for some ought to be done for all.
Parisien testified before the joint Public Health Committee last week in her capacity as president of the School Nutrition Association of Massachusetts, an alliance of food service directors.
The association has proposed improvements in the mandatory standards bill introduced by Representative Peter Koutoujian of Newton.
Koutoujian is revising the bill.
He plans to toughen the language limiting sales of soft drinks and other calorie laden products at fund raisers outside regular school hours.
He will also adjust the standards to conform to the guidelines offered by Massachusetts Action for Healthy Kids, a public private partnership devoted to reducing the incidence of childhood obesity.
The reauthorization of the federal school lunch program, passed last year, also mandates that school districts set standards, but it did not specify what they should be.
The Legislature needs to approve the revised Koutoujian bill to implement the federal law.
Children are faced with choices about what to eat every day, but schools are for education, and students should be offered only those food choices that are high in nutrition and low in the sugar, fat, and other empty calories that promote obesity.
Some of the fizz will disappear from beverage vending machines in schools across the United States in a move aimed at attacking childhood obesity by limiting the kinds of drinks sold to children.
The American Beverage Association which represents 20 companies that make up about 85 percent of school beverage sales announced new guidelines Wednesday aimed at reducing consumption of drinks believed to contribute to childhood obesity.
Coca Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. were among the beverage manufacturers that signed on to the guidelines announced Wednesday in Seattle.
The guidelines which are not mandatory were unveiled as the beverage industry comes under increasing fire from parents and health advocates.
Under the guidelines, drinks sold in elementary schools would be limited to water and 100 percent juice.
In middle schools, the guidelines restrict sales to "nutritious" or lower calorie beverages which include sports drinks, water, 100 percent juice, no calorie soft drinks and low calorie juice drinks.
However, participating beverage companies may still sell full calorie sodas and juice drinks with 5 percent juice or less in middle and high schools after classes end.
Soda will be offered in high school beverage vending machines but will make up no more than 50 percent of the selections.
In some places the guidelines may not take effect for several years, because existing contracts with schools will be allowed to expire.

In the efforts of food companies to appease nutrition advocates and serve an increasing number of health conscious consumers, Kraft Foods has crossed an improbable threshold a healthier cookie.
At a nutrition and obesity conference Thursday in Sacramento, Kraft's chief executive, Roger Deromedi unveiled whole grain versions of the popular Chips Ahoy and Fig Newton cookies a first among major food companies.
"They're baked with 100 percent whole grains, contain zero grams of trans fat per serving, and most important, taste terrific," said Deromedi, who participated with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and 800 schoolchildren in a one mile walk.
The cookies, which start appearing in stores this week, are the latest in the food industry's infatuation with whole grains.
As large food companies wrestle with claims that they have contributed to America's obesity problem, manufacturers have added whole grains to cereal, breads, crackers and now cookies.
Whole grains are considered healthier because they are less processed and retain more of their nutrients and vitamins.
Instead of refined and bleached white flour, Kraft's cookies are made with whole wheat flour, which contains naturally occurring B vitamins, vitamin E, iron and folic acid.
Whole wheat also contains fiber, which slows digestion.
Kraft's announcement was timed to the California conference in an attempt to show that the company is attentive to the health concerns of parents, who are increasingly worried about not just their own weight but that of their children.
In the last three decades, the overweight rate among teenagers has tripled, in adults, obesity has doubled.
In the face of such statistics, many state and local governments have moved to purge soda and unhealthy snacks from schools.
Thursday, Schwarzenegger also signed an ambitious school nutrition law.
The bill requires that by 2007, all California public schools will sell only bottled water, low fat milk, drinks with at least 50 percent fruit juice, sports drinks and snacks that meet fat, sugar and calorie restrictions.
While the new cookies are not healthy enough to make it into California schools under the guidelines, Kraft, a unit of Altria, says that the products give consumers who are looking to increase their whole grain consumption a choice.
But nutrition specialists warn that consumers should not think they are eating a health snack with either of the whole grain cookies.
A three cookie serving of the new Chips Ahoy has 8 grams of fat and 150 calories, 10 fewer than the original.
And there is one additional gram of fiber, two per serving instead of one.
Each serving of whole grain Chips Ahoy and Fig Newtons has 8 grams of whole grains, roughly 16 percent of the Federal Drug Administration's recommended intake of whole grains.
In addition to whole wheat, other whole grain foods are oatmeal, granola, brown and wild rice, as well as more exotic grains like millet.
In a taste test of the new Chips Ahoy version and the original, The New York Times Dining section gave the whole grain cookies a thumbs up.
While testers said that the texture was more akin to an oatmeal cookie than a chocolate chip cookie, they said it was an overall "better tasting cookie," with a "toasty and nutty flavor."
They also found that the new cookie tasted slightly less sweet than the original.
Kelly Brownell, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University and a frequent critic of food companies, applauded Kraft for making the change, but he worried that consumers might fall into what some call the "Snackwell effect."
When these low fat cookies were introduced in 1992, many consumers used the low fat billing to give themselves license to eat unmodest amounts.
Like whole grain Chips Ahoy and Fig Newtons, Snackwells are not low in calories.
"The population certainly needs more whole grains, but the optimum delivery vehicle is not cookies," Brownell said.
Still, Margo Wootan, nutrition director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, gave Kraft credit for adding some nutrition to what was previously empty calories.
"It's impressive that Kraft was able to do two 100 percent whole grain cookies," Wootan said.
She added that many General Mills cereals, which are packaged in boxes featuring a large whole grain banner, are made using a blend of whole grain and refined grains, not 100 percent whole grain.
Kraft, the country's largest packaged food company, says it will continue its push to develop healthier foods.
It has also come out with whole grain Wheat Thins and in the next few weeks, Kraft will start selling a whole grain version of its macaroni and cheese.
But the product will not be made using 100 percent whole grains and will have eight grams of whole grains per serving.
Thursday, Kraft also announced that it would expand its policy changes for marketing to children to the company's Internet sites.
Kraft runs two Web sites that feature games and promotions in which its brands are prominently displayed.
Reuben and Claudia Beck understand complex things.
Reuben, 84, who was a sailor in World War II and an engineer for 40 years, designed conveyor systems for automobiles before retiring at age 70.
Claudia, 66, a registered nurse, is a retired insurance claims adjuster who knows how to slash through red tape.
Even so, the Becks fear they have met their match in Medicare's new prescription drug benefit plan, designed to help seniors pay for medicine.
"It's just so confusing," Claudia Beck said.
"And it seems the more I call, the more runaround I get."
The couple, along with 42 million other seniors and disabled citizens eligible for Medicare, will have access to a benefit that seniors have wanted for a long time.
And there's no doubt the prescription drug program will help millions.
First, however, they must survive the jungle of jargon and confusing array of options that are tripping up thousands already and the benefit hasn't even started yet.
Medicare is the government program that provides health insurance for Americans 65 and older.
It has not previously covered outpatient prescription drugs.
But in 2003, Congress passed a law that will make prescription drug coverage available to those on Medicare starting Jan 1.
Private insurers are providing the coverage.
Those eligible for the benefit can pick an insurance plan from dozens being marketed to them.
Seniors generally will pay premiums and co payments as with most insurance policies.
But the confusion begins right at the beginning when seniors try to pick a plan.
In Georgia, there are 82 plans offered by 18 companies.
Deductibles, co payments, out of pocket expenses and covered drugs vary among the plans.
Imagine 82 plans with, say, five variables premium, deductible, co payments, drug list and pharmacy choice.
The variables become mathematically if not emotionally daunting.
"The new Medicare drug benefit is 10 times more complicated than the Medicare drug discount card," said Robert Hayes, president of the Medicare Rights Center, a New York based consumer advocacy organization, "and 10 times more important."
Even after comparing premiums, co payments, deductibles and rosters of drugs, the work will still not be complete.
Seniors will also need to determine how they'll stomach what's termed "the doughnut hole" a gap where there's no coverage after seniors rack up drug costs of $2250.
Under most drug plans, patients will have coverage up to $2250 in spending.
But between $2250 and $5100, they'll generally be on their own.
Medicare will pay 95 percent of covered drug costs above $5100.
Worth looking into Despite the difficulties, it's worthwhile for seniors to explore the new $700 billion benefit, especially those with limited incomes, those who lack drug coverage now and those with high prescription costs, experts said.
The best way for seniors to compare plans is by using Medicare's Web site or calling Medicare or a local insurance counseling service to use the Internet tool for them.
Gary Karr, a spokesman for the federal agency that runs Medicare, acknowledged "a little bit of anxiety" among consumers over the benefit.
But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also emphasized there's no immediate rush to sign up, that Nov 15 is just the starting point.
"People do have time to take a deep breath," said Dr Mark McClellan, the Medicare agency's administrator.
"They don't need to rush into a decision."
Enrollment is open between Nov 15 and May 15.
Coverage for those who enroll before Dec 31 will begin Jan 1.
If you wait until after May 15 to enroll, you might have to pay extra to join a plan.
The Medicare agency said seniors now can narrow down their choices based on what's important to them premium, deductible, available drugs, or other factors.
McClellan said CMS had added thousands of customer service representatives, and that during a recent week handled more than 700000 calls "with no or minimal delay."
The competition among drug plans has helped consumers, he said.
"What we're seeing is that drug plans are coming in at a lower cost and with better benefits than were expected."
Some plans have no doughnut hole or no deductible, he said.
"This benefit is really worth it," McClellan said.
Can't call everybody The Becks have struggled to find information about the 82 drug plans and analyze which one might work best for them.
For example, the Medicare pamphlet about the program could not list all the provisions of the 82 plans listed in Georgia.
"Am I going to have to call all 82 companies?"
Claudia Beck asked one day last week.
And the Becks wonder: If figuring out a prescription drug plan is this hard for them, how hard will it be for millions of others not as savvy or healthy?
Such insecurity among seniors appears to be widespread, according to Lisa Federico, coordinator of GeorgiaCares, a nonprofit insurance counseling service.
Her office is receiving about 300 calls a day from seniors frantic for help.
The staff can process about 80 of them, she said, creating a pileup of 220 calls a day and putting them at least a week behind.
"I've never seen anything like this, just the level of confusion this is generating," Federico said.
After some delays, the Medicare Web site (www.medicare.gov) for the drug benefit has finally opened, but still isn't fully functional, with a key piece of the "Prescription Drug Plan Finder" tool not working.
It frustrates counselors trying to help seniors.
The Medicare agency said the site would be completely functioning "in the next few days."
Even then, for many reasons, seniors will need insurance counseling, Hayes said.
"There will be insurers who will promote a low premium and disguise the extremely high co payments," Hayes said.
A senior can find out what drugs are covered on a plan's formulary, he said, "but people aren't being told how much they are going to pay" for the drugs.
State government retiree Robert Hauss, 75, said he feels a time crunch on his drug plan decision.
State retirees were told they must make a decision about keeping their current state drug plan by Tuesday, but Hauss said he didn't get his booklet from the state detailing the changes until Oct 27.
Other state retirees have also complained to GeorgiaCares about a tight deadline for the state plan.
On Friday, Gov. Sonny Perdue announced that he was extending the state's enrollment deadline 10 days, to Nov 18.
Hauss, meanwhile, said his retiree health plan will be about twice as expensive as its current cost if he doesn't join a Medicare drug plan.
"The state is forcing us to go into Medicare Part D," he said.
"I'm not happy with the changes."
But a spokeswoman for the state agency overseeing the retiree plan denied the state was pushing people into Medicare drug coverage.
"They have choices," said Julie Kerlin, spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Community Health.
"Employees make choices every time there is an open enrollment."
Hauss takes seven medications for chronic conditions, and worries that not all his drugs will be covered as they are now.
"Medicare Part D plans may not have the same drug formulary as the state health plan," he said.
Hauss isn't hooked into the Internet, so he's waiting for insurance counselors to call back.
Frustration is high Jim and Marlys Antonoff have spent hours compiling information on Medicare's drug benefit.
They've neatly filed brochures and information from seven drug plans in a plastic container.
They've called the insurance companies even politicians seeking answers.
Despite the painstaking work they have done to understand Part D, they're still frustrated by its complexity.
And they find themselves chuckling about the string of roadblocks they run into.
One roadblock: Three drug plans' phone numbers listed in the Medicare handbook are wrong, said Jim Antonoff.
Jim, 79, said he called an insurance company and asked, "Can you expedite the information to me?"
And the company's representative replied, "What's 'expedite'?"
"The average person is going to have a terrible time with this," Jim said as they finally navigated the Medicare Web site.
There are things that the Antonoffs like about the new plan.
It's an insurance policy against unforeseen drug costs that can run into the thousands of dollars, Jim said.
Jim could save about $1000 from the new benefit.
And his current out of pocket drug costs, with no prescription coverage, reach about $5000 a year.
Marlys, 67, could also save about $1000.
Still, Jim Antonoff said he thought Part D could have been designed much better.
"The average person is going to be so lost, they're going to throw up their arms and say, 'The hell with it,' " Antonoff said.

TARPON SPRINGS Robert Loos, 83, can Google with the best of them.
He searches travel deals on the Internet, pays bills online and stores crucial phone numbers in a digital address book.
So with enrollment in Medicare's new Part D drug benefit to begin on Tuesday, Loos powered up his Compaq 7550 last week and headed for the government's Web page.
In Florida, 19 companies are marketing 43 Medicare drug plans, and that doesn't count the various HMOs and PPOs that people can join.
Medicare has never been so complicated, so full of choices.
It's a classic chance for computer savvy people to bypass commercial advertising and free lunch seminars by searching www.medicare.gov on their own.
Medicare literature advises people to do just that.
But Loos fiddled at it for an hour Thursday with only mixed success.
The Web site was often ponderous.
It answered some questions, but rarely quickly.
Things got worse when Loos called Medicare's toll free hotline, 1 800 633 4227.
He meandered around in an irritating phone tree loop for about five minutes until he finally hung up and called back.
The second time, he found his way to one of Medicare's 8000 new "customer service representatives," a polite, patient man who turned out to be a fount of misinformation.
Medicare beneficiaries need not panic.
They have six more weeks to choose their 2006 coverage before it begins on Jan 1.
That also gives Medicare's designers time to tweak the Web site and hotline employees time to learn their jobs.
Still, Loos worries about his fellow retirees, especially those who don't use computers.
"I can't see how older people are ever going to determine what the best plans are," he says.
"They are going to be very confused."
Loos, who owned a trucking equipment business before retirement, does not want to join a Medicare HMO, which usually carries drug coverage.
He and his wife, Eileen, don't want to change doctors if an HMO shuffles its provider network.
The seven drugs Loos takes would cost more than $8000 a year if he bought them at his local Publix pharmacy.
Instead, he buys one from Canada, one from New Zealand and gets two free from Merck's patient assistance program.
That winnows his bill to about $2700 a year.
He would like to join a new Medicare Part D drug plan because he thinks the government is going to crack down on foreign drug importation.
When he checked www.medicare.gov, his high speed Internet connection moved him quickly through preliminary questions until he was asked to enter his seven medications.
Then it slowed to a crawl by forcing him to register his medications one at a time instead of all at once.
At one point, he tried to register Flomax and the computer said "service unavailable."
He back tracked, tried again, and it worked the second time.
"It's very, very time consuming," he muttered.
After about 15 minutes, the computer finally listed how much each plan would cost, from cheapest to most expensive, ranging from about $3600 to more than $8000.
When he clicked on other buttons, Medicare's Web site showed him how he could knock about $500 off the cheapest plan Humana Complete by using its mail order pharmacy.
He could knock off $770 more by swapping his drugs for similar ones preferred by Humana.
That brought the cost to about $2400 less than he pays now.
"Boy, there's a lot of stuff here," he said.
"So far, it's working pretty good."
After an hour, Loos was ready to quit, even though he still lacked price reduction information that might make other plans more attractive.
The Web site would only let him work through one drug plan at a time, which slowed him down.
He also wanted to check which plans restrict how his doctor can prescribe his drugs.
The Humana Complete plan, for example, required either prior authorization, quantity limitations or "step therapy" on every one of his seven drugs.
Maybe cheapest wasn't best.
Medicare's Web site can provide details about these restrictions.
But Loos had previously played around with that section of the Web site and found it confusing and time consuming.
Perhaps Medicare's toll free hotline could help.
Medicare literature urges people to call, particularly if they don't have access to a computer.
Medicare has 43 million beneficiaries, so it was no surprise that Loos was greeted by a recorded female voice guiding him through a phone tree.
When she asked if he wanted "information," that seemed like a good choice, but it sent him into a loop of various messages and didn't seem to tell him how to reach a live person.
After five minutes, he hung up and tried again.
This time, he tried other options and a customer service representative came on the line.
Loos asked what various drug plans would cost.
Would Loos like to keep his premiums and deductibles low, the man asked.
Deductibles range from zero to $250 a year.
"I'd like to pay nothing if I can," Loos responded.
As for premiums, maybe something like $25 to $30 a month.
It was a mistake on both their parts.
Given Loos' seven medications, the cheapest plan is Humana Complete, with a $61 a month premium.
Its total cost is less because it offers broader coverage that more than makes up for the higher premium.
The Medicare worker was following a script, as trained.
But when he limited Loos' premiums to $30 or less, the computer spit out a different Humana plan, an AARP plan and a United HealthCare plan as the three cheapest.
Then the worker inaccurately said each of the three plans carried co payments of 25 percent.
That's the amount for a hypothetical boilerplate plan that Medicare uses as a guideline in its literature.
But it bears no relationship to actual co payments.
"Who determines the cost of prescriptions?"
Loos asked.
"I guess the pharmacist," said the worker, when in fact the companies that offer the plans determine the cost of prescriptions.
Medicare spokesman Peter Ashkenaz said hotline workers are trained for at least a week before answering calls and receive at least two more hours a week of ongoing training.
Supervisors monitor about four calls a month for each worker.
The part of Medicare's computer program that lists the cheapest plan was installed last week, so the worker who helped Loos had only a few days of experience with it, at best.
Medicare hopes hotline calls will average about 10 minutes, Ashkenaz said.
Loos' call took 30 minutes.
Medicare has a toll free hotline and a Web site to help people sort through the new Part D drug coverage.
Both options can be frustrating as well as helpful.
If you want Medicare to help you compare drug plans, here are a few suggestions.
BY TELEPHONE Medicare has hired 8000 people to answer questions about the drug benefit and they are still learning their jobs.
So when you call, try these tips.
1) Have your Medicare card and a list of all your medications handy.
You will be asked for this information.
2) Call toll free (800) 633 4227.
A recording will offer you some phone tree options.
Choose "drug coverage."
3) After listing some pertinent dates, you will be asked to select either "enrollment" "information" or "publication."
The fastest way to talk to a live person is to select "enrollment."
After giving some of your personal information, select "agent" the next time you have an option.
That should connect you to a live person.
4) If you pick the "information" option, you may find yourself in a loop of various recordings.
When you are ready to talk to a live person, either return to the main menu and start over, or select the "status" option and follow that with the "agent" option.
5) Tell the agent you want a list of stand alone drug plans and their costs to you, based on your particular medications.
Make sure the agent types in your specific medications before comparing plan costs.
6) If the agent asks if you want to limit your premium and deductible cost, say "no." It may sound cheaper to pick plans with zero deductibles or a low premiums, but those plans may cost you more in the long run because they cover fewer drugs.
Tell the agent to compare all plans without restricting the premiums or deductibles.
7) When the agent lists three or four plans that seem to be the cheapest, find out what each plan will cost.
Ask if those plans place restrictions on your drugs.
If they all do, ask the agent to look for a plan that places fewer restrictions, even if it costs you a little more.
8) Write down your top three or four plans and contact those companies for more detailed information.
9) Ask the agent to mail you a written brochure covering the information you discussed.
ONLINE Be prepared to spend at least 30 minutes on this search.
1) Go to www.medicare.gov and click on "Compare Prescription Drug Plans."
2) About two thirds of the way down the next page, click on the orange button next to "Find a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan."
3) Next page: Fill in your personal information and click on "search plans."
4) Next page: Fill in parts A, B and C and click on "continue."
5) Next page: Click on "choose a drug plan type."
6) Next page: Click on C "search for Medicare prescription drug plans."
7) Next page: Click on B "Enter my medications."
(Do not click on C "limit your drug plans."
If you do, it may exclude the best and cheapest plan for you.)
8) Next page: List your medications into A "find your drugs by name."
When you are done, click on B "continue with selected drugs."
Then click on C "choose my drug dosage" and use the drop down list next to each drug to enter your dosage.
Then click on B "continue with selected drugs" then B "continue with plan list."
(Skip the pharmacy option for now.)
9) The next page lists the cheapest five plans in order of cost.
Go to a drop down box at bottom right and select the "All" function.
That will let you peruse all the plans more quickly.
10) To the right of each plan is a drop down box.
Go to the first plan and select "view cost details" in the drop down box.
Note that it tells you how to save money by using a 90 day mail order pharmacy.
Also, see if your drugs have asterisks next to them.
That means that the plan somehow restricts their usage (more about that later).
11) Go back to the plan list and click on "lower my cost share" in the drop down box.
This lists possible substitute drugs and how they will lower your cost.
If you click on the red link to each substitute drug, the computer will identify the substitutes so you can ask your doctor if you can safely switch to them.
12) Go back to the plan list and click on ". of pharmacies" next to the first plan.
This shows the pharmacies that will accept this plan.
The list is preset to show pharmacies within 2 miles of your ZIP code.
A drop down box lets you widen that distance and add more pharmacy options.
13) Repeat steps 10 through 12 with each plan that interests you.
Then contact the plans for full details of costs and any restrictions on your drugs.
You can find plan phone numbers by going to the plan list and clicking on the plan name.
14) For more information on drug restrictions, go back to Medicare's home page and click on "Formulary finder."
Follow that thread to the "plan list."
In the "Plans per page" box at bottom right, change the "5" to "All" and scroll down to the plans that interest you.
(All stand alone drug plans will have "PDP" in the third column.
Click on those plans for more information on how they restrict access to your drugs.)
Cox News Service WASHINGTON Nearly two years after President Bush signed into law the most sweeping change in Medicare's history, beneficiaries can begin signing up Tuesday for coverage of their prescription drugs.
Despite recent polls showing widespread confusion about how the benefit will work and concern that the coverage choices are too complicated, administration officials say they are confident the drug program will catch on.
By the time the open enrollment period ends next May 15, beneficiaries will have a better understanding of the program and "those polls will change," said Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt, in a conference call with reporters last week.
"This is the beginning of a new era in Medicare," Leavitt said.
"We will slowly build understanding."
Administration officials stress there is no need for beneficiaries to hastily enroll.
The drug benefit will not take effect until Jan 1, 2006, and beneficiaries can continue signing up until May 15, 2006, without paying a penalty.
But those who are eligible and do not sign up by then will pay a 1 percent a month penalty when they do enroll.
The next enrollment period after May 15 will be in November 2006.
With the enrollment period about to begin and beneficiaries being flooded with information from Medicare and dozens of prescription drug providers, interest in the program is quickly growing.
"More and more people are starting to pay attention." said Lisa Nora, coordinator and volunteer specialist at the Medicare Answers Prescription Savings Center in West Palm Beach, Fla. "They know that they have to make a decision."
Nationwide, the federal government is working with about 10000 local organizations to provide assistance, Leavitt said.
That help will be needed, experts say, because the program is so complicated.
Advocates of a drug benefit for the elderly had lobbied for years to expand the program within Medicare, but when Congress finally acted, it tossed the benefit to the private sector with a hefty government subsidy.
The result is that beneficiaries must enroll in private plans not in Medicare directly for the prescription drug benefit known as Medicare Part D. In virtually every state, beneficiaries are confronted with more than 40 competing drug plans, many of them different options offered by the same company.
It's like deciding which cell phone service to buy from competing companies and then selecting a particular calling plan within the chosen company.
A survey of Medicare beneficiaries late last month found that more than 60 percent said they do not understand the new drug law.
The survey, conducted by the non profit Kaiser Family Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health, also found that 37 percent of beneficiaries said they do not plan to enroll in a plan, 43 percent were undecided and only 20 percent said they planned to enroll for the drug benefit.
Most elderly who have not followed the issue are unaware that they have so many plans to choose from.
When told they have so many choices, nearly three fourths said that "makes it confusing and difficult to pick the best plan" while 22 percent said it "provides an opportunity to choose the best plan."
Critics of the drug law have argued for months that it is too complex.
They also have argued that if Medicare purchased drugs directly, the way the Department of Veterans Affairs does for veterans, beneficiaries would pay much less.
Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, which opposed the drug bill when it was in Congress, said its flaws "are producing bewilderment and confusion among seniors" and will also result in a far more costly program.
But Dr Mark McClellan, head of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said competition among the private plans has resulted in lower premiums, lower deductibles and lower copayments than had been predicted.
A study of the prices scheduled to be charged under the drug law for the top 25 most commonly prescribed medications used by the elderly found that the drug benefit will result in average savings of 20 percent on brand name drugs bought at a retail pharmacy and 27 percent through a mail order pharmacy.
For generic drugs, the savings are 44 percent for retail and 64 percent for mail order.
The study, based on filings with the Medicare program, was conducted by the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, the national trade organization representing pharmacy benefit managers.
McClellan said he was unconcerned that more than a third of Medicare beneficiaries say they don't intend to enroll in a drug plan because most of them have more generous coverage through a former employer.
The Medicare drug law provides substantial incentives for employers to continue to offer retiree drug coverage.
Of the more than 40 million elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, administration officials expect about 28 million to 30 million to enroll in a drug plan or remain in a federally subsidized retiree plan.
That includes about 10 million retirees with employer sponsored coverage, 12 million very low income people whose drug coverage automatically will be switched from Medicaid to Medicare, and 6 million in Medicare managed care plans that already provide drug coverage.
To help beneficiaries wade through the various plans, Medicare has created a series of tools that can compare costs and benefits.
Those tools available on the Internet at www.medicare.gov or by calling the Medicare hotline at 1 800 633 4227 allow beneficiaries to list the specific drugs they take and find out which plan will give them the best deal in terms of cost and convenience.
The tool enables beneficiaries to compare premiums, deductibles and copayments for each plan based on the drugs listed.
It also tells them which local pharmacies will accept the various plans, or whether drugs can be purchased through a bulk mail order or online supplier.
"It's a wonderful tool," Nora said.
"It really gets in depth on how much you are going to save.
You plug in (the information) and it's the best thing since sliced bread."
Drew.
E. Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said it's unclear how many beneficiaries will enroll in a plan, but he noted that "in the long run the bigger question is whether seniors believe they are getting?enough help with their drug costs from the plans they are in."

Donald Anglin, 68, takes five different medications, none of which he can recall the names of even though he swallows them on a daily basis.
His left arm is bruised from a recent surgery that introduced pins to his elbow and a plate to his forearm.
His ability to speak is often hampered by a stroke that happened several years ago.
And his clunky walker appears more like a hurdle than an escort he can depend on for mobility.
"I think the drugs I'm taking are making me an addict rather than actually helping the problem," said Anglin, a retired construction worker who lives in subsidized housing next to the San Bernardino Senior Center.
"And with all of these new drug benefits, they're just gonna make things worse.
I don't know how these new benefits are going to help me."
Anglin is not alone.
Scores of seniors throughout the nation are confused about the new Medicare prescription drug benefit known as Part D. It's called that because the program is next in line after Part C, another plan that essentially provides HMO benefits to seniors.
The issue with Part D is that enrollment begins Nov 15, coverage starts Jan 1, and many seniors have little knowledge about their own prescription drug coverage, let alone a new program that's only months away.
The prognosis: Some seniors could be paying more for their drugs without even realizing the scope of Part D. Only 33 percent of seniors recently surveyed by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation felt they had enough information about the new Medicare benefit.
And only 37 percent of those interviewed felt the drug benefit would be "very" or "somewhat" helpful.
At its core, Part D is supposed to help seniors gain control of spiraling drug costs.
But the cost of drugs don't seem to bother a group of lunching retirees at the San Bernardino Senior Center.
Some of the seniors receive benefits through Medicare sponsored HMO plans.
"So I'm not going to worry about it," said Kenneth Erwin, 76, whose mailbox has been bombarded by health plans seeking Part D business.
"And why should I worry?
This stuff is so confusing and my ability to be analytical is not the same as it used to be."
A cluster of California based health care companies offer Part D plans including Health Net, Kaiser Permanente, PacifiCare and others.
Most of these health plans say their members need not worry about Part D. In fact, many seniors won't even notice a change in their health benefits.
But for those shopping for a Part D plan, there are several variables worth considering.
All Medicare beneficiaries, no matter what their income or marital status, are eligible for Part D prescription drug coverage.
Medicare patients can obtain the drug benefit through two types of private plans: a prescription drug plan (PDP), or a Medicare Advantage plan (MA), which includes HMOs and regional PPOs.
Those who sign up for a PDP will only get drug coverage and consequently must receive their Medicare benefits via a fee for service program.
The MA route will cover drugs and all other Medicare benefits.
As for the cost of a Medicare drug plan, seniors will have to pay a monthly premium that is set to cover about 25 percent of a standard monthly premium.
In other words, patients may be billed $30 a month for plans that cover brand name and generic drugs.
In addition to that, participants will be charged a co pay of about 25 percent of the drug's price.
There is also a standard $250 annual deductible, but that only covers $2250 in drug costs.
After that's used up, beneficiaries then enter the "doughnut hole."
The hole is a $2850 gap in which the beneficiary has to pay 100 percent of the price of drugs.
Once $2850 is surpassed, Medicare kicks back in and pays 95 percent of the cost of drugs.
As confusing as the formula is, health plans are in favor of the program.
Jacklyn Kosecoff, executive vice president of specialty companies at Cypress based PacifiCare, deemed the Medicare overhaul as "the greatest single change in her career."
WellPoint Health Networks also looks favorably upon Part D. The Indianapolis based company believes that "supporting national solutions for seniors and our aging population is imperative to helping meet the overall immediate and future health care needs of our country," Susan Rawlings, president of senior services of WellPoint, said in a statement.
Of course, many health plans are happy with Part D because it allows them to market a new product and the government has agreed to foot a significant portion of the bill.
But for lower income individuals who are dual eligible, meaning they qualify for Medicaid or Medi Cal and Medicare, Part D deserves more scrutiny than accolades.
That's because under the new benefit, lower income seniors could be forced to switch plans in order to continue receiving the same prescriptions they're used to taking.
"The drug coverage they (lower income seniors) have will not stop, although the source will change," said Juliette Cubanski, senior policy analyst with the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization that focuses on health care issues.
"This is why a lot of people are on alert for what the experience might be for the dual eligible population."
Anglin is dual eligible.
But he has no idea what the future holds for his health needs.
A bulletin board is filled with information about Part D at the senior center he frequents.
Incidentally, the information is sponsored by a drug company.
Of the more than 42 million elderly and disabled Americans enrolled in the Medicare program, an estimated 14.4 million will be eligible for low income subsidies.
To qualify for those subsidies, incomes must be below $14355 for individuals and $20000 for couples.
Medicare is expected to pay $4189 of drug costs for beneficiaries receiving low income assistance.
Low income beneficiaries are also expected to spend 83 percent less for their drugs once Part D goes into effect.
But Jo Wales, coordinator of information assistance at the Long Beach Senior Center, isn't convinced seniors will be the ones saving money.
"They're going to be left in the dark.
They're going to be up a creek and left without a paddle," said Wales, 71, who is enrolled in an HMO plan.
"A lot of people, especially lower income, are used to having all of their medication paid for.
And the fact that they might have to start paying or carrying around a formulary of all of the plans only adds to the confusion."
Jim Anderson, a Pasadena based spokesman for Kaiser Permanente, said his concern is that seniors will purchase a Part D program, even if they already have the benefit through their Medicare plan.
If a senior does purchase a Part D plan and already has the benefit, it will immediately void their initial coverage.
"So we're trying to let people know that we will automatically enroll them in Part D and there is no premium at all," Anderson said.
Despite educational efforts on behalf of health plans and nonprofit organizations, many seniors remain apathetic.
Bobbie Foster, 71, doesn't care about Part D. "I've heard about it.
But when I get this stuff in the mail, I just throw it in the trash," said Foster, who carts around an oxygen tank on most days at the San Bernardino Senior Center.
"My problem is that I just switched from UHP to Secure Horizons (another HMO) and now I have to pay $57 a month to get my tank filled."
Which one should I pick?
Millions of people are asking that question as they consider Medicare's new prescription drug plan, which rolls out Jan 1.
The voluntary program also known as Medicare Part D will allow seniors and the disabled who are covered under the Medicare program to get subsidized drug coverage.
Medicare beneficiaries have been bombarded with mail, phone calls and advertisements over the last several weeks from plans eager to sign them up.
Enrollment starts Nov 15.
By now, they've probably realized it's more confusing than anything else.
Medicare beneficiaries have many plans to choose from each with its own premium, lists of covered drugs and participating pharmacies.
The Bush administration estimates the coverage (which will cost the federal government at least $720 billion during the first 10 years) will save beneficiaries an average of $1300 a year.
But in fact, the savings can vary wildly depending on factors such as what kind of drug coverage someone currently has or to how much they spend on prescription drugs.
A person who spends $1500 a year on prescriptions, for example, can save about $550 on the new plan.
But another person who spends just $500 may actually pay $198 more out of pocket because of premiums and drug co payments.
How to make a choice among the blizzard of plans?
"You don't have to understand every detail and every option," said Dr Mark McClellan, administrator of the federal Medicare agency.
"People just need to focus on what they want."
Following are some highlights and things to consider about the new drug plan.
ELIGIBILITY One of the biggest misconceptions about the new drug benefit is that it's only for low income seniors.
In fact, all Medicare beneficiaries are eligible.
People won't be automatically enrolled, however.
Enrollees have to choose a plan and sign up through a private insurer or with Medicare, either on the agency's phone or its Web site.
DECIDING IF IT'S WORTH IT The plans make most sense for people who are already spending a lot of money on prescription drugs, and for low income seniors, who may be eligible for financial assistance with premiums and drug co payments.
The costs for each plan can vary considerably depending on what's offered.
This year, monthly premiums vary from nothing to as high as $60 a month, although cheaper plans usually have much leaner coverage, with higher deductibles and fewer covered drugs.
WHICH PLAN TO PICK This essentially boils down to what prescriptions you use and how you like to pay for them, and the kind of medical coverage you have.
Plans can look very different, because the government is allowing insurers to structure them as they want.
They merely have to be "actuarially equivalent" to each other they must, in other words, provide the same benefit in the end.
For most people, the first $250 is not covered, but the next $2000 is except for any co payments you may have to make.
Following this, you will have to pay the next $1350: Experts refer to this as a "doughnut hole" in coverage.
But after that, 95 percent of drugs are covered, which is meant to help people with catastrophically high drug costs in any given year.
There are two classes of plans among the dozens of offerings.
The one you'll pick will depend on whether you're buying just a drug plan or adding it to your current managed care plan.
Seniors who choose to stay in Medicare's traditional fee for service plan can only buy what's called a stand alone prescription drug plan.
Those who are in Medicare Advantage HMO plans about one fourth of all beneficiaries will now get the drug benefit added to their current planWhether the premium will rise, and by how much, depends on the plan.
"People need to sit down, take a breath and figure out what is best for them," said Bonnie Burns, Medicare policy and training specialist for California Health Advocates, a nonprofit Medicare education and advocacy group.
EMPLOYER DRUG COVERAGE: KEEP IT OR NOT About 30 percent of Medicare recipients have drug coverage through a former employer, which is often better than the coverage the government is offering.
Think hard before dumping that coverage, experts say.
"Retirees who cancel their employer coverage and take the new federal benefit may not be able to go back if they later realize they've made a mistake," said Tricia Neuman, director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.
WHICH DRUGS ARE COVERED, WHICH AREN'T Don't automatically assume that the medications you currently take will be covered by a new plan.
Each insurer will have its own list of covered drugs, known as a formulary.
If you take lots of medications especially if they're expensive ones you'll want to carefully go over each plan and make sure those drugs are on the list.
Check if your pharmacy is covered too.
Something else to consider: Several plans offer discounts for people who use generic brands.
If a drug plan decides to remove a drug you use from its formulary in the future, they must notify you 60 days in advance.
You will be able to switch your plan, but you may have to wait till the next enrollment period.
WHEN TO SIGN UP You can sign up any time from Nov 15 through May 15, 2006.
If you sign up after that, you may face a penalty of 1 percent a month until you enroll.
That also applies to people who turn 65 after May and delay signing up.
For example, the premium for someone who is 65 or older who waits four years may be 48 percent higher for the rest of his or her life.
Remember: This is an insurance plan, and it may make sense to sign up now.
Even someone who doesn't use a lot of prescriptions today may come to use more as they get older.
You can switch your plan once a year.
IF THE NEW DRUG PLAN IS TOO COSTLY About one third of enrollees will qualify for some type of financial assistance.
If your annual income is less than about $14000 (or $19000 per couple) and you have less than $11500 in assets ($23000 per couple), not including your home or car, you are eligible for additional assistance.
The amount will vary depending on your exact situation.
If you think you qualify, you should contact your local Social Security office.
WEIGHING THE PLANS AGAINST MEDIGAP Medigap is private insurance that seniors can purchase to pay for costs Medicare doesn't cover, which up until now has included prescription drugs.
But because the government is heavily subsidizing the new Medicare drug plan and doesn't subsidize Medigap plans, Medigap will prove more costly for most people, and they should switch.
DEMISE OF THE DRUG DISCOUNT CARD In 2003, after Congress passed legislation for the new drug benefit, seniors were given temporary discount drug cards to carry them over until the plan began.
You can continue to use your Medicare approved drug discount card until you enroll in a Part D plan.
But whether you sign up or not, on May 15, 2006, the card will stop working.
November 15 will never rival July 4 or December 25, but it is definitely a date to remember.
That's when Medicare finally enters the age of wellness and prevention.
When it started in 1965, Medicare was built around episodes of illness.
If you developed cancer and needed surgery, Medicare would defray hospital bills.
Flu?
Broken hip?
Medicare paid for doctors and nursing home rehab.
But prescription drugs never entered the picture an omission that grew increasingly glaring as modern science proved more and more effective at keeping people well.
It makes no sense to forgo a $30 a month generic statin while shelling out $50000 when a heart attack leads to hospitalization, surgery and rehabilitation.
Politically, drug coverage became a potent campaign issue among the coveted senior vote.
The oft repeated image of a poor widow choosing between food and Fosamax always energized a crowd.
On the other hand, Medicare already gobbled up a huge chunk of the federal budget.
With 40 million younger Americans uninsured, could we really afford to beef up insurance benefits to everyone older than 65?
Even for people who are healthy and wealthy?
Two years ago, the Bush Administration and Congress crafted an uneasy compromise with advocates like AARP: Medicare would underwrite a portion of drug costs, but average beneficiaries would still have substantial out of pocket bills.
Low income people would get a better deal than people of means.
The government would not dictate prices or even jawbone discounts out of the manufacturers, as it does with doctors, hospitals and nursing homes.
Instead, insurance companies would act as private drug brokers, setting up plans that would seek discounts and compete for customers.
All of which brings us to Nov 15.
That's when people on Medicare can start choosing how to arrange their health care for 2006.
The new drug benefit Medicare's biggest transformation ever complicates those decisions.
The drug program, called Part D, is not just new, it is all over the block.
Nineteen companies are authorized to offer Medicare drug plans in Florida, many with two or three options.
Premiums range from $10.35 a month to $104.89.
Formularies cover some drugs, but not others.
Then there is the so called "coverage gap," or more informally, the "doughnut hole," or "Krispy Kreme," a financial Bermuda Triangle that can swallow coverage when total drug costs are more than $2250 and less than $5100 a year.
How complicated is Part D?
Medicare's Web site (www.medicare.gov) contains a list of "frequently asked" questions about the new drug benefit.
Earlier this month, it listed 983 "frequently asked" questions.
Such complications aside, there is much to like about these drug provisions at least from a beneficiary's standpoint.
Medicare is going to pay the insurance companies $700 a year for everyone who signs up for a drug plan.
That underwrites a lot of drug buying and still leaves room for profit.
Unlike most insurance where premiums and copayments cover the risk the bulk of this benefit is financed by taxpayers as a whole, not by the contributions from individual Medicare beneficiaries.
Humana's Standard plan carries a premium of just $10.35 a month.
Coventry Advantra, PacificCare and WellCare all have plans under $20.
At those prices, even beneficiaries who take no drugs will benefit from signing up.
If they suddenly have a illness, they will quickly earn back the premium.
And if their health declines later in life, they can get cheap drugs without paying a stiff premium penalty.
Many low income people who blanch at a $20 premium can qualify for what Medicare calls "special help."
This subsidy reduces premiums, deductibles and copayments.
Yearly out of pocket drug costs will average $130 for those people.
By adding hundreds of thousands of Medicare clients to their rolls, the drug plans can buy in bulk and can negotiate discounts from manufacturers.
Discounts will come in handy when beneficiaries enter the "coverage gap," and have to pay 100 percent of costs.
The new Medicare also improves HMOs and PPOs.
Their clients cannot enroll in separate Part D drug plans, which are designed to supplement Medicare's traditional Parts A and B. However, Medicare is also beefing up payments to HMOs, to help them stay competitive.
In return, the HMOs must enhance their drug coverage or other benefits.
That suits Pauline Policastri, 72, just fine.
The Hudson resident and her husband, Salvatore, belong to a Humana HMO.
She loves its Silver Sneakers wellness program, which pays for a YMCA membership so she can take dance and exercise classes three days a week.
Like other HMOs, the Policastris' plan charges no monthly premium and provides drugs with minimal copayments.
If the Policastris were to return to traditional Medicare, they would face copayments for doctors and hospitals and an extra Medicare premium if they wanted the new drug coverage.
"It's frightening," she says.
"What little pension we have doesn't go up while everything else everything goes up around us.
If you get sick and don't have something to protect you, you're in trouble."
Lastly, the Bush administration has a lot of political capital riding on Medicare Part D and has budgeted $100 million to inform people and guide them through the process.
Among other things, administration officials swear that beneficiaries can get all the help they need by calling a toll free 1 800 633 4227 hotline.
A live person is supposed to answer, around the clock.
Advocates and state agencies figure the drug benefit is a good deal and are devoting a lot of energy to help as well.
For example, a two day senior expo scheduled for Nov 16 17 at Tropicana Field will feature seminars and enrollment help for Medicare beneficiaries to assess plans, sign up for coverage or apply for low income subsidies.
So pull up a chair and browse through this issue of Seniority.
It is full of useful information about the new Medicare.
And mark Nov 15 on the calendar.
You can't sign up for anything until then.
This is just the study phase.
After a two year wait, on Tuesday more than 40 million Americans eligible for Medicare can start to sign up for Medicare Part D, the program's voluntary prescription drug benefit.
And by Tuesday, a quarter of those people, some 10 million retired American workers, will find out something more specific: whether their former employers will continue to pay for their prescription drug benefits in 2006.
Tuesday is the deadline for employers to say "yes," "no" or, perhaps, "maybe."
This group of retirees includes my wife, Sara, and me.
In our case, we were waiting for a letter from General Electric Co., where Sara worked for 23 years.
When she retired, she signed up for a GE retiree prescription drug plan, which pays 70 to 85 percent of our drug costs.
We get our medications by mail and pay $25 for a 90 day supply.
It's a benefit we did not want to lose.
We began to worry about whether GE would continue its drug benefit when Congress voted in 2003 to let Medicare pay for prescription drugs, which opened the door for some companies to drop their retiree coverage.
The new voluntary drug benefit begins Jan 1 and is expected to be of financial help to many seniors who have no drug coverage.
Part D allows people on Medicare to get their drugs in one of two ways: by buying an individual drug policy or by signing up with a Medicare Advantage managed care plan.
The new drug plans are being offered by private health insurance companies.
Retirees who have approved drug coverage from former employers will not need to buy a Part D plan.
So Sara and I were relieved when we received a "yes" letter from GE, telling us that our drug coverage would continue without change.
One of the reasons for our concern was that our out of pocket drug expenses under the GE plan last year were $1685.
But if we had been in a standard Medicare Part D plan, our expenses would have been about $5000.
We did not want to go there.
The new Medicare drug benefit, expected to cost more than $724 billion over 10 years, is being regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).
To encourage employers to retain their retiree prescription coverage, Congress offered them a 28 percent tax free subsidy of the cost of that coverage.
But the question was: Would employers keep their drug plans and take the subsidy, or would they dump their plans to save money, knowing that retirees could now get prescription coverage from Medicare Part D?
The speculation seemed reasonable.
The number of corporate employers offering retiree health benefits has declined steadily for 15 years.
Part D could have provided an escape hatch for employers who wanted out.
In addition, employers had to jump through some difficult regulatory hoops to prove to CMS that their plans were as good as the standard Part D drug plan.
Developing the proof turned out to be a costly, time consuming process that required employers to hire a small army of actuaries and consultants.
Employers who passed the CMS tests were able to claim they had "creditable coverage," a requirement for getting the 28 percent subsidy.
When Sara and I got our letter from GE, it said: "GE has determined that the prescription drug coverage offered by the GE Pensioners' Prescription Drug Plan is, on average for all plan participants, expected to pay out as much or more than the standard Medicare prescription drug coverage will pay in 2006."
In Medicare speak, that meant that GE had passed the CMS tests, would take the subsidy from the government and would continue to provide our prescription coverage.
Enclosed in the GE packet was a "Certificate of Creditable Coverage," suitable for framing.
GE said we should keep it in a safe place.
The reason for the caution is that people who do not sign up for a Part D prescription plan by May 15 will face a 1 percent per month premium penalty if they sign up later.
The penalty will be waived for those who can show they already had "creditable coverage" when the deadline passed.
GE, of course, was not the only employer to face a decision on whether to continue its retiree health coverage.
Thousands of corporations and state and local governments had to make similar choices.
While most retirees are getting "yes" letters, others will not be so fortunate.
If you receive a "no" letter meaning your employer's plan is not as good as the standard Medicare plan and you want to buy better coverage, you will have to sift through dozens of Medicare drug plans offered by health care companies.
If you receive what is, in essence, a "maybe" letter, it may say that your former employer will continue to pay for some of your retiree drug benefits, at least for a while, but that you may have to move into a Part D plan.
How many employers are staying, how many going?
The CMS says it is too soon to provide a scorecard.
But Mark McClellan, CMS administrator, in an interview predicted: "The vast majority of employers will take the retiree subsidy."
And that means, he said, that millions of retirees will continue to get drug coverage from former employers in 2006.
Meanwhile, several retired friends told me they, too, had received "yes" letters from their former employers.
One, a former accounting manager at GMAC, received a "yes" letter from General Motors Corp., which provides his health and drug benefits.
The letter said retirees who want to keep their coverage should not join a Medicare Part D plan.
He said he likes his GM health benefits and was happy not to have to join a Part D plan.
I also talked with people at Lockheed Martin Corp. in Bethesda, Md.
The company has about 50000 retirees eligible for prescription drug benefits, according to spokesman Thomas Greer.
Lockheed Martin, he said, will maintain its benefits, take the government subsidy and send out notices to retirees by the Tuesday deadline.
"We feel it is important to keep our plans unchanged to ensure stability for our retirees during introduction of Medicare Part D," Greer said.
In some cases, the subsidy will allow employers to lower retiree premiums in 2006.
For example, Dow Chemical Co. said it would share its Medicare subsidy money with retirees on a 50 50 basis.
As a result, said Janet Boyd, director of government relations, "We expect that our eligible Medicare retirees' 2006 premium will be reduced by about $20 a month."
The decision to share rather than keep the subsidy money, Boyd said, was not only good for the retirees but also helped increase the company's contribution to the retiree drug plan.
By doing that, she said, it made it easier for the company to qualify for "creditable coverage."
Meanwhile, IBM said it would share one third of its subsidy with retirees.
The action will help reduce scheduled premium increases by $13 a month for individuals, $26 for couples.
The Medicare employer subsidy applies to retiree drug expenses between $250 and $5000 a year in 2006.
The average subsidy is estimated to be $668 a year.
By comparison, Medicare will contribute an estimated $1200 a year per person for people who sign up for Part D stand alone drug plans and Medicare managed care plans.
Thus Medicare will save money if employers can be persuaded to take the subsidy which by itself will cost $41 billion over 10 years.
I couldn't immediately find employers who sent "no" or "maybe" letters.
But the Fresno Bee reported that retailer JC Penney Co. had decided to discontinue all health benefits for 9500 retirees who are 65 and older.
"The fact that Medicare was implementing prescription drug coverage in 2006 was the impetus for the change," said spokesman Tim Lyon.
JC Penney will help retirees enroll in an AARP plan and will pay 55 percent of the premium for one year, he said.
However, dropping out is not going to be widespread, said Jon Gabel, vice president of the Washington based Center for Studying Health System Change.
Dropping a retiree health benefit, he said, is "the very last thing employers want to do."
They know, he added, "that it will lead to all kinds of public relations problems."
But employer enthusiasm for the subsidy may be temporary, predicted John Gorman, president of Gorman Health Group, a Washington consulting firm.
"In 2007," he said, "you're going to start to see an exodus of employers and unions from their own plans in order to move their retirees into Part D options."
Many employers, Gorman added, view the subsidy as "putting a Band Aid on a shotgun wound,It will slow down the bleeding ,but it is not going to stop it."
Meanwhile, leaders of public employee unions are advising their retirees: "If you have creditable coverage, it's OK to sit still," said Steven Kreisberg, collective bargaining director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
There are between 300000 and 400000 retired public employees around the country, he noted.
What does Kreisberg think will happen in 2007?
The labor leader said he thought that some employers might begin to look for "creative solutions," in which they would give up the subsidy in order to set up their own prescription drug plans or Medicare Advantage managed care plans, or find other ways to partner with Part D plans.
If employers decide to move to Part D options, bringing more people and more premiums to the plan, Kreisberg said, it may give retirees "a bigger bang for their buck" because the additional federal dollars could provide better benefits.
Louis A. deBottari, a 78 year old retired aerospace worker with good drug insurance, recently opened an envelope from Boeing, hoping to be reassured.
The notice, sent to about 100000 Boeing retirees and their dependents, discussed the new Medicare drug insurance program that begins in January and what it means for retirees already covered by the company's health plan.
"In general," deBottari read, "your Boeing prescription drug coverage is more generous than standard Medicare prescription drug coverage."
So far, so good.
But a bit farther down came a warning, if deBottari was nonetheless tempted to give the new Medicare program, called Part D, a try: "Your Boeing prescription drug coverage is part of your Boeing retiree medical plan.
If you cancel your Boeing prescription drug coverage, your Boeing medical coverage also will be canceled."
Many other retirees fortunate enough to already have drug coverage are receiving similar warnings from their former employers as the new Medicare drug benefit approaches.
This was not necessarily what Congress intended when it passed the Medicare law two years ago, extending drug insurance to more than 40 million older and disabled Americans.
The aim then was to provide benefits similar to those already enjoyed by a more fortunate minority of retirees about 10 million, currently who have drug coverage from former employers.
In practice, though, that fortunate minority is worrying about the future of their own benefits.
And the message many are receiving from their former employers is a surprisingly stern one: Stay put or else.
The attitude may be understandable.
Many employers generally offer drug benefits within a comprehensive package that also covers doctors' services and hospital care.
They typically do not charge a separate premium for drug coverage and do not administer it as a separate benefit.
And so they say they have no convenient way to split up the benefits package they now offer.
There is another factor.
Like other employers who continue offering drug insurance as good or better than Medicare's, Boeing will receive a federal subsidy for the drug purchases of each retiree it retains.
Many of those companies have shown little interest in continuing to provide other, increasingly expensive health coverage to a retiree if they lose the drug subsidy.
And so deBottari is staying put and trying to ignore that big employers like General Motors are trimming their retiree health benefits and that Wall Street analysts are predicting many other employers will eventually scale back or even end their own drug programs, relegating retirees to the less generous Medicare plans they are now being advised to avoid.
By Nov 15, all employers who offer drug coverage to retirees and employees 65 and older are required to send word to those beneficiaries, indicating how the company's drug plan compares with Part D. Employers must also inform retirees of any changes in their existing health benefits.
In a survey early this year of 458 large employers that had retiree health plans, 82 percent said they planned to continue drug coverage for retirees under those plans, according to the benefits consulting firm Watson Wyatt.
During the current advisory period, many large employers that offer retiree drug coverage including GM, Caterpillar, Verizon Communications, SBC Communications and the Southern Co. are, like Boeing, telling their people that the company's plan is as good or better than the Medicare drug program.
And "more so than not, plan sponsors are saying if you join Medicare Part D, you will be out of our plan," said Edward Kaplan, a senior health care consultant at the Segal Co., a benefits consulting firm.
A notable exception is GM, which is letting retirees keep their other company health benefits, even if they sign up for Part D. Dow Chemical, for example, is telling its people that they have a choice to make.
Low income retirees may want the new, special Medicare subsidies.
But if they decide to go with a Medicare plan, they cannot stay in the Dow retiree Medicare plan, which does include drug coverage.
"They cannot be in two drug plans, under CMS rules," said Teri Ferguson, benefits manager for Dow.
Retirees at Dow can return to the company plan in 2007, an option that isn't available at some companies.
JP Morgan Chase, in its letter, warns retirees who choose Medicare and lose Morgan benefits: "You may not be eligible to reinstate this coverage following a two year transition period."
Staying in a company's plan allows retirees to fend off an often bewildering array of choices touted by insurers and other private sponsors of Part D plans, which are overseen by Medicare but actually provided by private industry.
In some parts of the country, older Americans may have up to 45 Medicare plans to choose among, with premiums that average $32 a month but whose coverage and co payments vary widely.
"I don't have to deal with Medicare Part D and I'm delighted," said Marlene Barnes, 69, a retired federal office worker in Memphis, Tenn., whose health benefits are provided by the Federal Employees Health Plan.
People who do want to sign up for a Medicare drug plan can do so penalty free from Nov 15 to May 15, there could be increasingly stiff late fee penalties for those who delay.
But the penalties will not apply to retirees who currently have solid employer sponsored coverage but who shift later to a Medicare plan if, say, their current employer sponsored plans are curtailed or ended.
The number of companies providing retiree health benefits has been shrinking for decades, as rising costs for drugs and other health needs have cut sharply into profits.
And benefit consultants say that many employers, after seeing how things work out with the Medicare subsidies in 2006, will be weighing possible changes in their retiree benefits for 2007 and beyond.
Only 1 in 3 employers with 200 or more workers currently provide retiree health benefits, down from 66 percent that offered these benefits in the late 1980s, according to the most recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust.
Virtually all employers' retiree plans 98 percent include a drug benefit, according to a separate survey Kaiser conducted late last year with the benefits consultants Hewitt Associates.
This year, even before Part D became an issue, Visteon, an auto parts maker, said it would no longer provide health benefits to salaried workers who retire after June 2007.
Airlines like Northwest and United have been cutting retiree benefits in bankruptcy proceedings.
Sears is eliminating retiree health benefits for younger current employee and new hires.
And in a notice to retirees last year, Rockwell Collins, an avionics maker, said it would no longer offer drug benefits to Medicare eligible retirees after 2007.
Whether the new Medicare subsidies will halt the decline in retiree benefits, as some Bush administration officials have predicted, is unclear.
J.C. Penney said it was ending drug coverage for 9500 retirees eligible for Medicare.
Tim Lyons, a spokesman for Penney, said it would help out during a one year transition by paying 55 percent of the monthly premiums for an AARP plan operated by UnitedHealth Group that covers drug costs not covered by Medicare.
"The government will actually pay employers to continue to provide something," said Helen Darling, president of the National Business Group on Health, an organization of large employers.
"If this works, it may be a model for some other things in the future."
Caterpillar, which provides retiree health benefits to more than 30000 people, is filing for the federal subsidy.
"Although the general trend has been to drop retiree health coverage," said Linda Fairbanks, a Caterpillar spokeswoman, "the new federal program, with the subsidy, will help Caterpillar and other employers continue to provide health benefits."
The subsidies will equal 28 percent of a retiree's drug costs, from $250 to $5000 in 2006, whether those costs are paid by the employer or the retiree.
The Bush administration estimates that the subsidy payments to employers will average $668 for each qualified retiree in 2006, with a maximum of $1330 per retiree.
Many predict that the program could be vulnerable to cost cutting.
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that Medicare will spend $71 billion on employer subsidies from 2006 to 2013, including $5 billion next year.
Larry Boress, vice president of the Midwest Business Group on Health, a regional employers' group, warned of possible cutbacks.
"The subsidy is a good step, but is it going to be maintained, or reduced over time?"
Boress asked.
"Congress is looking for money."
Even at the current level, the subsidy is not enough to offset employers' rising health costs.
Before GM's recent announcement of cutbacks in benefits, the company had used its 2004 drug costs as a model and calculated that the new Medicare law would have reduced those costs for current and future retiree benefits on its income statement by $603 million.
That would not be enough to wipe out the $871 million increase in GM retiree health costs for the year.
Despite the planned overhaul of its retiree health benefits, the drug coverage at GM will be at least as good as standard Medicare drug benefit, according to Sharon T. Baldwin, a company spokeswoman.
Some big employers, including Dow Chemical and IBM, said they planned to use part of the Medicare subsidy to reduce health insurance premiums for retirees next year.
At Dow, the monthly premium for its most popular retiree health plan now about $49 for someone who worked a full career at the company would have increased to $57 next year, according to Ferguson, Dow's benefits manager.
Dow's benefit plans cover 38000 retirees and dependents on Medicare as well as 21500 active employees in the United States.
Thanks to the subsidy, Ferguson said, that monthly premium will be approximately $35.
Kaplan at Segal said that nearly two thirds of his company's clients were taking the Medicare subsidy.
"But they are wrestling with the strategy," he said: "'Should we continue to protect our members' against health care expenses?
What is our commitment to them?
Can we afford to do it?"'
Some small employers that still provide retiree drug benefits say the Medicare subsidy may not be worth the trouble, at least for the first year.
The town government of Normal, Ill., with only 20 eligible retirees and spouses, found that costs for consultants and preparing paperwork to apply for the subsidy would outweigh the $6000 that Normal could expect from Medicare, said Pamela Reece, a town official.
Instead of applying for the subsidy, Normal intends to continue its current health plans and offer extra coverage to fill in the gaps in Part D plans for retirees who decide to join a plan operated by an insurance company.
In other cases, the current benefits provided by smaller employers may not meet the minimum Medicare standards.
"Many of our cooperatives might not qualify for the subsidy," said Scott M. Spencer, senior vice president of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.
Spencer's group is offering its own Part D drug plan in 47 states.
Meanwhile, few of those 10 million retirees whose coveted drug benefits the new Medicare program was meant to emulate, are feeling secure.
"I'm worried," said deBottari, the aerospace retiree.
People eligible for the Medicare prescription drug benefit that takes effect Jan 1 can choose from a variety of plans that include the new coverage by itself or as part of a broader health insurance package.
Here are some tips on narrowing the options: IF you have no prescription drug coverage now, THEN you should purchase a stand alone prescription drug plan, or a broader Medicare Advantage Plan that includes drug coverage along with coverage for traditional Medicare services such as visits to doctors and hospitalization.
IF you now have drug coverage through a health plan offered by your former employer or union, THEN you may not need to do anything.
Your former employer or union will let you know if your current coverage is at least as good as the new Medicare benefit.
Signing up for a Medicare Part D drug plan could jeopardize your existing coverage.
IF you now receive benefits from both Medicare and Medicaid, THEN your drug coverage will be moved from Medicaid to Medicare.
You will automatically be assigned to a Medicare drug plan, but with the option of switching if you find another plan.
If you do not sign up for a drug plan, you will automatically be assigned to one.
IF you have a so called Medigap health plan, which provides coverage for benefits not provided by traditional Medicare (including prescription drug coverage), THEN you should study the cost of the Medicare prescription drug plans and decide if one of them is better than the drug coverage provided under your existing Medigap plan.
If so, you can cancel the drug coverage in your existing Medigap plan.
IF you now receive health coverage through a Medicare Advantage Plan, THEN your current health plan will offer you a new option that incorporates prescription drug benefits with traditional Medicare benefits.
IF you now receive drug benefits through the Massachusetts Prescription Advantage Plan, and are eligible for Medicare, THEN you will automatically be assigned to a randomly selected Medicare drug plan.
Low income beneficiaries will be required to apply for Medicare subsidies.
Enrollment in Medicare's new drug coverage started Tuesday, and seniors are clamoring for advice on how to navigate a crucial program that offers more than 50 options.
Joan Parks, director of Sacramento's Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program, or HICAP, said her office is getting more than 200 phone messages a day far more than the staff of eight can quickly return.
"We're just deluged," said Parks, whose program provides free, unbiased consumer advice.
"But I refuse to sink."
Medicare's new drug coverage, called Part D, goes into effect Jan 1.
During this initial enrollment, the state's 4.3 million beneficiaries have until May 15 to make a choice.
A HICAP sponsored information session Tuesday at the Elk Grove Senior Center drew an audience of 85.
Questions, and concerns, were plentiful.
"I take about 20 medications, and half of them are extremely expensive, so I am really worried about this," Helen Casillas, 64, of Elk Grove told the counselors.
Later, the retired Realtor said, "I am terrified by it.
One of my drugs alone is $200, and others are nearly that high."
In addition to presentations to senior groups across the region, HICAP's staff and 40 trained volunteers provide one on one counseling.
But seniors and the disabled may have to be patient.
Because of the number of calls, Parks said, it may take her staff five days to return calls.
Some are calling more than once when they don't get a return call the same day, adding to the volume.
"We're doing our best to meet that need," Parks said.
"They may get a voicemail."
She said people should call once and "know we will call them back."
Parks said HICAP isn't taking on new volunteers at this time because she doesn't have the staff or time needed to train them on the complicated new coverage.
She encouraged Medicare beneficiaries to attend a community presentation to learn the basics.
"There's a lot of resources at those events and they're constantly bringing in the new information," Parks said.
Casillas said she attended Tuesday's Elk Grove session because she is having trouble getting her questions answered.
"The worst part is that the people in charge are just learning it," she said.
"They know very little.
I've been calling them for a while."
Medicare officials are encouraging people to call the (800)MEDICARE telephone assistance line or go online to get enrollment information.
The challenge is for beneficiaries to figure out which of the 47 stand alone drug plans or seven Medicare managed care health plans available in Sacramento is right for them.
Jack Cheevers, spokesman for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in San Francisco, said there has been a "robust" use of Medicare's Web site at www.medicare.gov, which offers details of the plans.
But Parks said many of those seeking advice are older people without computer access or skills to use Internet search tools to compare plans.
They may not have family or friends to turn to for help.
HICAP receptionist Denise King said some seniors have complained to her they are put on hold or transferred when they call Medicare, and do not get their questions answered.
There's a wait for one on one HICAP counseling appointments.
While some feel rushed to make a choice, others may wait until the last minute.
Michael Negrete, an official with the California Pharmacists Association, spoke at a community event Monday night to residents of a gated mobile home park.
Only 20 of the 200 residents invited actually attended, he said.
Negrete said pharmacists are learning about the coverage to be prepared to help customers.
His best advice to consumers is get a good understanding of the coverage you have now, make a list of all medications now needed and decide which pharmacy you'd like to use.
Beneficiaries who get traditional fee for service Medicare may want to consider one of the 47 stand alone prescription drug plans offered statewide.
Others who now are enrolled in a Medicare managed care plan may consider signing up for an enhanced package with that insurer that will include prescription drug coverage, he said.
Many retirees may want to stay with their current prescription drug coverage through a former employer's health plan if it is comparable to what's offered through Medicare.
They came equipped with notepads of questions and lists of medications, and with the thick red white and blue handbook "Medicare & You."
Nearly 200 strong, they came looking for help in figuring out which among dozens of bewildering plans would buy them the most medicines for the least price.
Several hours later, many left a little less confused but not necessarily any closer to a decision.
"It's wearing me out," Betsy Curtin confessed as she and her husband departed the James Lee Community Center near Falls Church, Va.
She sounded almost indignant about the complexity of the new Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Coverage, the federal government's effort to offer millions of older Americans a way to better afford their pills.
"I'm a college graduate.
I worked about 20 years for the Air Force," Curtin said.
And she has a computer and some savvy using it.
And still, papers in hand, she grimaced.
"It's challenging."
Just days into the launch of Medicare's biggest expansion since its inception 40 years ago a program that could run taxpayers $720billion in its first decade seniors and the people trying to advise them are incredulous about the multiplicity of options, deductibles, premiums and exceptions, which make comparisons seem overwhelming, if not impossible.
They say the same thing, whether in information sessions large and small or in one on one appointments.
"It's been driving me crazy," said Rita Reitman Sobel of Alexandria, Va., her face betraying her doubt and anxiety after Thursday's presentation.
What she and the rest of the audience heard was hardly reassuring.
Although Part D will greatly benefit certain people, its savings are not universal.
The annual costs of its various plans, which are being marketed by private companies, can vary by thousands of dollars, and a penalty could multiply many beneficiaries' bills by thousands more if they sign up after the deadline.
And the best way to sort out the competing information?
Via the Internet and searches that most seniors say are beyond their ken.
Enrollment started Tuesday and continues, for those 65 and older, until May 15.
Actual coverage begins Jan 1.
The program's arcane intricacies and implementation, preceded by a barrage of advertising, have been so criticized that some lawmakers are pushing for a two year delay.
"This is a bad piece of legislation, and it never should have been enacted," Rep James P. Moran Jr., D Va., told the community center crowd, which responded with applause.
The program is too complicated, he said, too expensive and "too much of a giveaway to the pharmaceutical companies."
Yet, Moran added, "I want to emphasize, I don't think you have a choice.
You've got to sign up for it."
Questions and concerns took on greater urgency after enrollment officially commenced this week.
Calls to the Medicare Rights Center, an independent, New York based organization, quadrupled over previous weeks' volume.
"People know the marketing materials arrived in the mail ,that there's a benefit, but whether it's right for them is a complete mystery to them," spokeswoman Deane Beebe said Friday afternoon.
"We're still trying to figure out what to tell them."
In northern Virginia, the Fairfax Area Agency on Aging has trained volunteers to assist local residents who walk through the door, sometimes carrying a shoebox of pill bottles.
The seniors listen carefully but, invariably toward the end of the conversation, lean in close and lower their voices.
"They say, 'What would you do?" program coordinator Howard Houghton said.
When the counselors explain that they can't cross that line, their clients try a different approach: "What would you tell your mother to do?"
Around computers in an Alexandria apartment complex's community center, several seniors paired Friday with workers from the city's Office of Aging and Adult Services and tried to make sense of the future.
Social worker Irene Ilachinski sat with Maria Tarzi and looked over her list of medicines.
"I don't know if there's a plan that takes all of them," she said, "but we'll see what's available at least."
Ilachinski called up the online Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder and began clicking on specific brand names: Zocor, Plavix, Nexium and a half dozen more.
Thirty five plans popped up.
A few feet away, MaryAnn Griffin typed in the same details and appropriate dosages for Tarzi's cousin, Mahboub Rafik, and then hit enter.
The results: 40 possibilities, from a Humana plan with annual costs of $3880.66 to a plan from PacifiCare that might run $10257.12 a year.
"Well," Griffin said to Rafik, "we're not going to take that one, are we?"
The deadline is approaching for elderly and disabled people who must decide whether and when to enroll in one of the new Medicare Part D drug plans that start Jan 1, 2006.
The so called Part D program for the first time brings drugs under the Medicare tent that covers 42 million people.
The program is set up to be federally subsidized but run by the commercial insurance industry, a combination that some say generates confusion.
Companies are clamoring to compete, and some are adding to the confusion by offering dozens of plans with a welter of wrinkles and widely varying prices.
Further, some insurers keep adjusting their offerings.
But there are some basic steps to help consumers decide which plan, if any, is right for an individual.
Hari Peterson, 69, a retired nurse in Warwick, R.I., has survived the process.
"I found it to be confusing, but we really studied it," said Peterson, whose husband, Ray, 72, has drug coverage from the Department of Veterans Affairs that he plans to keep for now.
She collected information on computer printouts from senior centers and talked with state insurance advisers at a Medicare fair.
"I gave them my prescriptions and they pinpointed it down to two or three plans," she said.
Peterson also plans to consult her longtime pharmacist before making a final selection.
Consumers who want coverage to start in January can make a selection by Dec 31, but they can also wait until May 15 to select a plan, without penalty.
The Web site medicare.gov can answer many questions and help with plan comparisons.
Medicare is also operating a telephone help line around the clock, 1 800 Medicare, which has an automated voice system that also allows callers to reach a real person.
Those who decide now can still check for a better offer next week.
Through Dec 31, consumers can change their minds.
And it may pay to keep checking, because some insurers are continually adjusting their offerings.
Signing up my father for a Medicare drug plan should be simple, especially because the Medicare.gov Web site is well designed and easy to use.
If only the real world would cooperate.
My father is 92 years old, lives in a nursing home and takes 10 prescription drugs, paid for from his savings and Social Security income.
His medicines cost him $636.88 a month, or $7642.56 a year.
He now gets a discount on his drugs because he has a Medigap policy, which he buys for $93.23 a month from AARP to cover some health care costs not picked up by Medicare.
Without the AARP Medigap discount, his drugs would cost nearly 40 percent more: $1044.72 a month, or $12536.64 a year.
So how does he or actually, how do my sister and I, who manage his affairs slash through the dozens of Medicare drug plans available in the part of suburban Washington where he lives?
How do we decide whether he should sign up for any of them and, if so, figure out the best plan for him?
My sister, Martha Bari, to avoid the onerous research she was fearing, considered simply choosing an insurer with a trusted name.
A likely candidate was UnitedHealthcare, the company used by the AARP Medigap program.
But when I looked at the Medicare Web site, the research tool there seemed easy to use.
The site lets the user compare drug plans, based on the information one enters.
I called Martha and told her I wanted to give it a try.
It turns out that you really do need a computer to sort through drug plans because there are so many variables.
What drugs are you taking?
Where do you live?
What plans are in your area?
Are you willing to switch to generics if they are an option?
Do you care which pharmacy supplies your drugs?
Do you want to order them by mail?
Are you in a nursing home that only uses one pharmacy?
Those considerations can affect the price you will be charged.
And, depending on how big a discount a plan offers, you may be better off with one that does not cover all of them but that deeply discounts the drugs it does cover.
In terms of your out of pocket expenses, such a plan might work better than a plan that covers every drug but offers smaller discounts.
I set to work, blithely thinking I would could sort things out in half an hour.
I discovered, instead, that it took two days to get the information I needed before even starting to use the Medicare Web site.
First I had to find out what drugs my father was actually taking and how much he paid for them.
Initially, Martha and I understood that my father was taking eight drugs.
Only after checking with the nursing home did she get the complete list of 10.
Then I called AARP to find out exactly what type of Medigap plan my father has and what it covers.
Next came a call to the pharmacy to find out what the drugs would cost without my father's AARP discount, which involved providing a list of the medications and then waiting for a call with the prices.
And how would my father's Medigap policy be affected if he signed up for the Medicare drug plan?
Would the Medigap plan pick up some of his leftover drug costs?
And if it no longer covered his drugs, would his Medigap premium decrease?
I eventually learned in a phone conversation with Jim Pogue, who manages AARP insurance for the UnitedHealth Group, that my father's Medigap plan would provide discounts on any drug not covered by a Part D plan.
But the Medigap premium would remain the same whether or not he needed the supplemental drug coverage.
That meant that unless a Medicare plan was cheaper than the $7642.56 a year my father pays for his drugs with the AARP discount, he might as well not sign up for a new plan.
Finally, after two days and many phone calls, I had the information I needed.
And the actual process of comparing drug plans was fun a breeze, in fact.
Last Friday, I plugged my father's drugs into the Medicare Web site.
I specified their doses and the preferred pharmacy, which is 35 miles from his nursing home but the only one the nursing home will use.
Voila!
I got a list of 42 plans.
They were ranked in order, based on my father's total annual out of pocket expense for his drugs would be, including the monthly drug premium and the annual deductible for each plan.
I had the ability to compare any three plans side by side, in as many combinations as I chose.
The variations were astonishing, with the estimated yearly cost varying by more than 100 percent.
Under the least expensive plan for my father's situation, one offered by First Health Premier, he would pay an estimated $4008.72 a year, or $3633.84 less than he pays now.
His monthly co payments would be $142.70, lower than with any other plan, and his monthly premium would be $22.91, among the lowest of all the plans.
Under the most expensive plan, AmeriHealth Advantage Rx Option, he would pay $8454.33 for the same drugs from the same pharmacy or $811.77 more than he pays now for those drugs from that pharmacy.
His monthly co payments would be $673.42, and his monthly drug premium would be $23.16.
It took only 10 minutes to get the list of the drug plans and their prices for my father from the Medicare Web site.
But the most amazing thing was what happened next.
I went to the Web site again last Tuesday, four days after first entering my father's data.
This time the results were different.
I thought there must be some mistake.
But, no, I had a printout from the first session, and there had been a change.
There were six additional plans that were not there before, for a total of 48 instead of 42.
And the prices were lower, especially for plans at the high end.
First Health Premier was still the cheapest but $3977.01 now, compared with $4008.72 four days earlier.
AmeriHealth Advantage was still the most expensive, but its price had dropped to $6978.94, from $8454.33.
What was going on?
Peter Ashkenaz, a Medicare spokesman, explained that the agency updated the plans and their prices every Monday.
He said that the insurers were starting to assess one another's plans and revise them to be more competitive.
I asked Ashkenaz: What happens if you choose a plan and then the next week it becomes cheaper, or another plan becomes cheaper?
As it turns out and Ashkenaz allowed that Medicare was not particularly publicizing this wrinkle you can change plans every day from now until the end of the year if you want to.
Whichever plan you are enrolled in on Dec 31 is the plan you will be in when the program starts on Jan 1.
And you will be paying the rate that was quoted when you enrolled.
Even after that, you can change plans one more time before May 15, the last time to sign up for the Medicare drug benefit with no penalty, Ashkenaz said.
For those who do not want to use the Web site, or cannot use it, there is another option.
Call Medicare's toll free number, 1 800 MEDICARE, specify "enrollment" on the voice mail prompt, and tell the customer service representative the drugs you take and where you live.
Medicare says it has 7500 such service representatives handling calls 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
The service agents are assigned to walk the caller "through everything that's up there and will send them a printout we call it a personalized brochure," Ashkenaz said.
I called the number and got right through to a service agent in the middle of the day last Thursday, with no wait.
I told her that I was a reporter and that I was just testing the system, I did not ask her to go through the whole drug plan search process for me.
And then I tried again the next day with the same result.
As for Martha and me, we have not yet signed my father up for a plan.
I told her that I now think the best strategy is to sign up for the cheapest plan and then keep checking back every week on the Medicare site to see if a better option comes along.
Who knows maybe the prices will rise in the next month, and we would want to be signed up before that happens.
Martha says it is up to me to do all that checking if I want to, but it is not something she cares to take on.
And she wonders how many people will.
The government's celebrated new prescription drug program for senior citizens got off to a rocky start this month, with elderly consumers fuming over its complexity and federal websites crashing under heavy traffic.
But perhaps the worst news came last Tuesday, when Rep Henry Waxman released a report showing that a typical senior citizen could get a better deal at Costco or Drugstore.com than in the elaborate new Medicare marketplace.
It's too late now to change the law, which passed Congress in 2003, and too soon to rewrite it.
But it's not premature to study whether it's really serving the interests of Medicare beneficiaries and the taxpayers who will pay its massive cost.
Waxman, a California Democrat, asked congressional investigators to study the 10 top selling drugs among senior citizens, and then compare prices available at popular discounters against prices in the new Medicare Part D, which relies on private insurance companies to deliver coverage.
They found that, on average, drug prices in the new Medicare were about 3 percent higher than prices available to any customer at Costco or Drugstore.com and 60 percent higher than prices in Canada.
Given the enormous sums that Congress poured into the Medicare subsidy, that's bizarre.
To be sure, this is not the last word on Medicare Part D. Some elderly consumers, buying some medications, probably will find better prices through Medicare plans.
And it's worth remembering that congressional skeptics were wrong before: A year ago they predicted that insurance companies would balk at entering the Medicare market, but today there are dozens with Medicare drug offerings.
It's only fair to give this big, complicated new system a year or so to prove itself.
That said, congressional Republicans who promised that competition among private insurance companies would improve Medicare, delivering low prices for consumers and low costs for taxpayers, now bear a heavy burden of proof.
The Veterans Administration, for example, doesn't operate that way.
It simply negotiates bulk discounts with drugmakers and pays far less than retail.
So does Medicaid, the federal state insurance program for the poor.
And yet the 2003 law that created Part D specifically forbids Medicare to negotiate the same sort of bulk discounts.
The theory of market competition is powerful, but it shouldn't be taken as gospel.
As economist Paul Krugman has argued, private markets might be the best way to produce cars and computers, but are a horrible way to deliver health care.
The United States relies on private markets to deliver health care far more than any other developed nation, and yet Americans pay far more for health care than consumers in other advanced nations.
If the new Medicare Part D turns out to be expensive but wonderful, it might be worth it.
If it turns out to be inexpensive but complicated, that also might be acceptable.
But if it turns out to be complicated and wasteful too, Americans will find it's time to go back to the drawing board on health care.
The Bush administration is about as likely to admit the Republican Medicare drug assistance plan that was rushed through Congress has flaws as it is to say, "Uh, you know there were some questions about the intelligence on Iraq."
Senior citizens who are trying to sort through their drug coverage options face many problems, a main one being that those options are complicated and difficult to compare.
Another, it now turns out, is that many drug companies that have been giving drugs (or selling them at low cost) to seniors in order to promote their products while giving elderly people a break aren't going to offer such programs anymore.
Why?
The companies fear they may find themselves wrestling with Uncle Sam if they try to maintain what they're doing for seniors while participating in government programs at the same time.
The government's logic evidently is that if the companies waive drug costs, then they might be considered to be making illegal kickbacks.
The thinking is that the companies might be setting aside their fees to induce patients to take drugs that were more expensive than ones offered by competitors.
If the patients then signed up for the Medicare program, the government and taxpayers would have to pay the difference.
Confusing?
Oh, it's not as bad as it will be for a lot of seniors.
Consider, among many facts in an N&O report from staff writer Jean P. Fisher, that the Medicare Part D plan is going to be run by dozens of private insurance companies across the country.
In North Carolina, 16 companies are offering 38 different plans.
Individuals who have less than $14355 in annual income get free or reduced premiums.
That income figure is maddeningly low, of course, and seniors who are just a little above it, or even a good bit above it, may be in dire straits indeed.
Drug companies that offer patient assistance programs typically have a higher income cutoff, about $19000 a year.
The concept of covering prescription costs through Medicare is worthwhile.
But the plan now going into effect smacks of a political taint: The president and his party vowed to do something about drug costs for seniors but wanted at the same time to protect drug manufacturers and insurance companies no matter what.
It's a mess.
It's hopelessly confusing.
It's a plan that won't help nearly as many people as it should help, and will leave some worse off than they are now.
Instead of turning the tide against a movement toward a national health care system which is what this administration and the drug and insurance industries are desperately trying to do this program will only encourage it.
The next edition of Congress, which unfortunately won't be in until after the 2006 elections, will have a repair job on its hands.
And its members will have plenty of reason to get busy.
It's the right thing to do for senior citizens for whom a reliable supply of affordable medicine can be a cost effective life saver.
It's also politically smart, as anyone can tell who's paying any attention to the considerable voting clout elderly Americans have.
Confused about the new Medicare prescription drug coverage?
A new source of help is on the way.
A national coalition of senior and consumer advocacy groups said Tuesday it will dispatch a fleet of vans equipped with wireless computers and trained staff to North Carolina and 26 other states.
The goal: to help Medicare enrollees understand the optional prescription drug coverage, which takes effect Jan 1.
Vans should start rolling into the Triangle and Charlotte areas by mid December.
The education campaign "My Medicare Matters" comes a week after people enrolled in Medicare began signing up for the new prescription benefits.
Many older adults have complained that the program is overly complex, and some advocates fear that people who would be helped by the benefit will throw their hands up and fail to sign up.
"Doing nothing ,is not the right response for America," said James L. Firman, president of the National Council on the Aging and chairman of the Access to Benefits Coalition, a collection of more than 100 groups that is coordinating the campaign.
My Medicare Matters, which is supported by a $10 million grant from pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, will aim to help people enrolled in Medicare get the information they need to make an informed choice about whether to sign up for Medicare Part D, as the new prescription coverage is known.
Its counselors will do that largely by helping people tap existing online resources, such as the Medicare drug plan finder that is available at www.medicare.gov.
People can punch in the medicines they take and compare prescription plans available in their area by cost and coverage, greatly simplifying comparison shopping.
However, few Medicare enrollees are using the online tool or any of the other information Medicare makes available at its Internet site.
A national survey of Medicare members conducted recently by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School of Public Health found that just 6 percent of respondents had even visited the Web site.
My Medicare Matters will supplement existing education and outreach efforts in North Carolina.
The largest single resource now operating in the state is the N.C.
Seniors' Health Insurance Information Program, which has seen the number of calls to its information line, at (800) 443 9354, nearly triple in recent weeks, largely because of questions about Medicare Part D. "Anything that is going to result in North Carolina having additional counselors who are educated and can help people is wonderful," said Carla Obiol, the SHIIP program's director.
"The magnitude of this program change is so great we almost can't have enough help."
This is the first day people on Medicare can determine their health coverage for 2006 whether they receive care through Medicare's traditional Parts A and B or through a Medicare HMO or PPO.
For the first time, people on Parts A and B also add a Part D drug benefit to help pay their prescription bills.
To get Part D coverage, you must sign up with one of 19 private insurance companies offering 43 different plans in Florida.
Today is the first day you can enroll in a Part D plan or in a Medicare HMO or PPO.
When does Part D drug coverage begin?
Coverage starts Jan 1 if you have signed up by the end of this year.
You can also sign up between Jan 1 and May 15, but the drug plan will not defray your costs until you have signed up.
How do Part D drug plans work?
The company negotiates discounts from drug manufacturers and resells to you, usually at a below market price.
You will pay a monthly premium to the company and receive a drug plan card to show your pharmacist when you fill prescriptions.
The company will charge you an annual deductible, if any, and copayments.
Medicare will reduce these costs by subsidizing the company for serving you.
How much do plans cost?
Your costs will vary widely from plan to plan.
Premiums in Florida range from $10.95 to $104.89 a month, deductibles from $0 to $250 a year.
Often coverage ceases when total drug costs hit $2250, then begins again when total costs hit $5100.
Copayments can range from $0 for a 30 day generic to $75 for a brand name drug.
There is no free lunch.
Plans with broader coverage charge higher premiums.
How do HMOs fit in all this?
If you want to get your hospital and doctor care through a Medicare HMO or PPO, it will also provide your drug coverage, and usually more cheaply than traditional Medicare.
Part D drug plans only accompany Medicare's traditional Parts A and B, where you pick your own doctors and hospitals.
Warning: You can't have both a Medicare HMO and a Part D drug plan.
If you sign up for both, Medicare will disenroll you from the HMO and put you on traditional Medicare Parts A and B. Some companies, like Humana, Blue Cross Blue Shield and WellCare offer both HMOs and Part D plans so be careful what you sign up for.
I'm healthy.
Must I get drug coverage?
No. Just like Part B doctor coverage, the new Part D drug coverage is optional.
However, if you reject coverage now, Medicare will charge a penalty if you change your mind later.
Monthly premiums will rise 1 percent for each month you reject coverage.
If you have no drug coverage now, it's probably wise to enroll in Part D. You can join a plan for as little as $10.95 a month.
For that, you get coverage if you suddenly become sick and you avoid premium penalties later in life, when you are taking drugs.
What if I can't afford the premiums?
If you qualify for Medicare and already receive drugs through Medicaid or state assistance programs, you will automatically be enrolled in a Part D drug plan without having to pay premiums or large copayments.
As of Jan 1, Medicaid will no longer provide drugs to people who also qualify for Medicare.
Even if you are not on Medicaid, you might qualify for reductions on premiums, deductibles and copayments if your income falls below $14356 ($19246 for a couple) and you don't own a lot of liquid assets such as savings, CDs and stocks.
Some income is not counted, so if you are anywhere close to qualifying, check with Social Security toll free at 1 800 772 1213.
How do I sign up?
If you want to join an HMO or PPO, contact them directly.
If you want to add a Part D drug plan to traditional Medicare Parts A and B, you can contact the private drug plan directly or sign up online at www.medicare.gov or by calling toll free 1 800 MEDICARE (633 4227).
How do I pick a plan that is right for me?
The Medicare & You 2006 booklet that Medicare recently sent you lists information about drug plans and company phone numbers.
The people who answer 1 800 MEDICARE can give give a list of the three cheapest plans based on your medications.
Or you can research that directly at www.medicare.gov.
Florida's SHINE program can give one on one advice if you call toll free 1 800 963 5337.
Expect to leave a message, but a SHINE volunteer will call you back.
Information on companies is also available on www.sptimes.com/medicare.
What are the pitfalls?
If you take very many medications, be wary of picking the plan with the lowest premium.
You often can save money by paying more for broader coverage.
Make sure the company includes your drugs on its formulary and will let you use the pharmacy of your choice.
Many plans require prior authorization or restrict prescription quantities for some drugs.
Ask each company if they restrict your drugs and how.
Consider paying a slightly higher premium for a plan with fewer restrictions on your specific drugs.
What if I get drug benefits from my ex employer's or union's retiree health plan?
Retiree plans offered by employers and unions are often cheaper than Part D plans.
You probably should keep these retiree benefits as long as Medicare deems them "creditable coverage."
If so, you can always switch to a Medicare Part D plan later without paying any penalty.
Ask your ex employer or union whether your retiree plan qualifies as "creditable."
If it isn't, you probably should switch to a Medicare HMO or a Part D drug plan to avoid paying a premium penalty later on.
Will manufacturers still offer free drugs?
Many "patient assistance" programs for low income people will end Jan 1.
If you rely on one of them, contact the manufacturer for details.
Six counselors toting laptop computers will begin scouring the Twin Cities in a van in search of Medicare beneficiaries who need help signing up for the new drug benefit, officials said Tuesday.
"We'll be a lot more effective helping people who need a hand figuring out this new benefit people whose health and finances may improve significantly because of help paying for their drugs," said Janine Stiles of the Minnesota Senior Federation.
The new cadre of counselors also may help ease pressure on the statewide Minnesota Linkage Line, which is wrestling with a backlog of more than 1000 calls for help enrolling in the Medicare drug program.
Counselors will work with the Minnesota Access to Benefits Coalition, which Stiles coordinates.
The coalition has been in the field for a year helping educate older and disabled beneficiaries about the Medicare drug benefit.
In about two weeks, the counselors will start showing up at already scheduled informational sessions about the drug benefit and will visit other sites.
They will help beneficiaries sort through more than 60 private plans offering drug insurance.
The benefit will start Jan 1 for those who enroll by Dec 31.
The local effort is part of a national campaign and funded by a $10 million grant from British drugmaker AstraZeneca to the National Council on the Aging.
The council organized the national Access to Benefits Coalition last year.
This year it is financed largely by a $2 million grant from the drug manufacturers trade association.
NEW ONLINE HELP In its announcement Tuesday, the council also unveiled a streamlined Web site www.MyMedicareMatters.org to help Medicare beneficiaries and their families learn about the drug benefit and plug into the enrollment process.
The new computer site, financed in part by the federal government, supplements the Medicare Web site that some older people have complained is cumbersome and at times is slow because of heavy Internet traffic.
Demand on the Medicare Web site was so heavy Tuesday that its enrollment tool was unavailable for much of the day, officials at the Minnesota Linkage Line said.
THANKSGIVING CONVERSATIONS Medicare officials have not released any information about how many people have joined a Medicare drug insurance plan since enrollment started Nov 15.
"My hunch is we'll know more maybe even get a big push in enrollments after families talk about the drug benefit over their Thanksgiving dinner," said Peter Ashkenaz , a spokesman for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Medicare program administrator Mark McClellan urged families Tuesday to have those conversations.
"We'll do as much outreach as we can," he said.
"This new initiative with counselors and computers will help.
But the best outreach will come from families, talking it over with their parents and aunts and uncles."
The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post: Over the past few days, the Medicare.gov Web site has been jammed.
Tuesday, it could grind to a halt.
That's because it's the first day of open enrollment for Medicare Part D, the Medicare drug benefit for seniors.
Already, anecdotal and polling evidence shows that many seniors are baffled by the benefit, which requires beneficiaries to choose from several dozen private plans.
More than six in 10 told a Kaiser Family Foundation pollster that they understand the new drug benefit "not too well" or "not at all."
Only one in five said that they plan to enroll.
Worse, more than three quarters said they have never used the Internet, although the Medicare.gov Web site provides the most efficient means of comparing the different plans.
All of that bodes ill for a benefit that its creators have promoted as the wave of the future: the first example of 21st century, public private health cooperation.
But as seniors start signing up and they have until May 15, when a late fee kicks in it's important not to judge the plan by the inevitable initial glitches and anticipatory fears.
For one, it is possible that seniors, by gravitating toward the simplest plans, will force the system to become simpler.
In the long term, the benefit's success will be measured in at least two ways.
The first is by cost: to seniors and to the government.
At the moment, the average senior will pay about $32 in monthly premiums, some $5 less than predicted.
The average government subsidy per person is running at $94 monthly, rather than $109.
These savings are the result of better than expected competition among private insurance companies, many of whom got better than expected deals from drug manufacturers.
The real test, though, is whether those are lasting savings or whether the insurers will find it necessary to raise costs over time.
The other (related) measure of success is how many seniors enroll.
Former Louisiana Sen John Breaux, D, one of the benefit's congressional authors and now chairman of the Medicare Rx Education Network, reckons that the benefit will be a success if half of eligible seniors enroll.
But that's just an estimate: The real test is whether enough healthy people stay in the program to keep insurance companies interested in offering it and to keep premiums low.
President Bingu wa Mutharika declared Friday a national day of mourning for the late Pope John Paul II, allowing the faithful to attend special services.
All government offices, banks and businesses closed Friday, the day of the pope's funeral at the Vatican.
Malawi has more than 4 million Roman Catholics, making it the largest church in the southern African country.
The president, a Roman Catholic, attended a special mass in the capital, Lilongwe, where he praised John Paul as a man of peace and love.
The funeral ceremony for Pope John Paul II began Friday in Saint Peter's Square in front of a seething mass of mourners and state leaders.
Applause broke out as the plain cypress wood coffin was borne out of Saint Peter's Basilica by 12 bearers in black and placed on a small dais before the altar.
Dignitaries from around the world stood in respect as the coffin was placed at the heart of the altar.
A red bound New Testament was opened and placed on top of the coffin, its pages flickering in the wind, as funereal music played and Catholic prelates took their seats.
The requiem mass for Pope John Paul II ended Friday at 12:30 pm (1030 GMT), drawing lengthy applause from the huge throng of mourners and state leaders massed on Saint Peter's Square.
Several hundred people of all faiths prayed Friday evening at Warsaw synagogue for Polish born Pope John Paul II, who was laid to rest in Rome.
The ecumenical prayer service was led by the Grand Rabbi of Poland, Michael Schudrich, Poland's PAP news agency said.
"In his lifetime, John Paul II worked to unite people.
We are all the children of God and a few hours ago, down there (in Rome) it worked we were really united," Schudrich told the gathering.
Schudrich had taken part in John Paul II's funeral in Rome earlier Friday.
Warsaw's Jewish community numbers some 400 people.
Before World War II the Polish capital had the second largest urban Jewish community in the world after New York City.
Schudrich has estimated the number of Jews living in Poland at between 30000 and 40000 only a fraction of the pre war number of around 3.5 million.
The body of Pope John Paul II was laid to rest in the crypt of Saint Peter's basilica on Friday after an open air funeral mass, Vatican officials said.
Pope John Paul II's native Poland came to a standstill Friday as tolling bells and wailing sirens signalled the start of his funeral in distant Rome.
In Krakow, some 800000 pilgrims who had gathered on Blonia esplanade, a vast field on the city's periphery where the pope celebrated mass for some three million people on his last visit to Poland in 2002, fixed their gazes on specially erected giant screens showing live images from Rome.
They, and the huge crowds gathered in towns, cities and villages elsewhere around the country, watched emotionally as John Paul II's simple wooden coffin, adorned with a cross and the M for Mary, was brought from Saint Peter's Basilica into the huge square outside and placed in front of an altar.
"We want to be together with other people," said a young mother on the esplanade with her two children, aged one and six.
"When I was four, I saw the pope for the first time in Warsaw in 1979.
I was with him then and I am sure my children want to be here now," she said.
"We are here to once again sing our thanks for the pontificate of John Paul II," Bishop Jozef Guzek was quoted by Poland's PAP news agency as saying before the start of the funeral ceremony.
"Time will dry our tears.
We now transform our silence into prayer," he said.
John Paul II had special, close ties with Krakow, having studied in the former royal capital, been ordained as a priest there and celebrated his first mass at the city's Wawel Cathedral in 1946.
He was bishop and cardinal of Krakow from 1963 until he was elected pope in 1978.
In the capital Warsaw, trams and buses, and the few pedestrians in the streets, stopped in their tracks as tolling bells and moaning sirens signalled the start of the ceremony at 10:00 am (0800 GMT).
With Friday declared a national holiday for the funeral, shops, local and international schools, banks, even the busy Warsaw stock exchange were shut.
Many Poles chose to watch the ceremony from home, where it was beamed live from Rome by Polish television.
Those who did venture outside sought the company of fellow mourners in places such as Blonia esplanade in Krakow, in front of the basilica of Our Lady in the southern town of Wadowice, where John Paul II was born Karol Wojtyla in 1920, or at Warsaw's Pilsudski and Zamkowy squares where giant screens had been set up.
More than the 20000 people who usually live in Wadowice were gathered outside the town's basilica.
Most watched the ceremony without tears, their faces frozen in concentration as they took in the words and images of their favourite son before he was laid to rest.
Near them, an empty chair was draped with yellow and white colours of the Vatican, appended with the black ribbon of mourning.
Sitting in the chair, John Paul II had bantered with inhabitants on his last visit to his birthplace in 1999.
In Warsaw, some 30000 gathered in Pilsudski Square, another high holy place in John Paul II's pontificate.
It was there that, on June 10, 1979, the pope uttered the memorable phrase: "May the spirit come down and renew the face of this land."
Those words were interpreted by many as an exhortation to stand up to the oppressive communist regime and allow a new Poland to be born.
John Paul II, who died on Saturday April 2, is widely credited with helping Poland to throw off the cloak of communism.
Only a new pope can beatify John Paul II, a Vatican spokesman said Saturday, saying any decision creating a saint was "in the sole competency" of the pope's successor.
The spokesman, Joaquin Navarro Valls, was speaking a day after the funeral of John Paul II, when a section of the massive crowd called for his immediate sainthood.
Cardinals are to meet in secret at a conclave beginning April 18 to elect a successor to the pontiff, who died a week ago after 26 years as leader of the Roman Catholic Church worldwide.
Friday's funeral mass for John Paul II was briefly interrupted when many in the crowd began chanting "santo, santo" repeatedly.
Others held up large banners demanding "santo subito" (sainthood now) for a man who created more saints than all his predecessors put together.
The Catholic Church has three steps to sainthood.
First is a ruling that the person concerned has led an exemplary life.
The next stage is beatification, which requires proof of a miracle as a result of his intercession.
The final stage, canonisation, requires at least one more miracle.
A monument to John Paul II was inaugurated Saturday at Rakowicki cemetery in Krakow, where the late pope's family are buried.
The 1.6 metre (five feet four inches) high bronze, by sculptor Czeslaw Dzwigaj, depicts the pope kneeling on a prie dieu, or kneeling desk.
Dzwigaj finished the monument four years ago but Krakow city authorities decided at the time not to place it in the cemetery.
On his visits as pope to his native Poland, John Paul II often prayed at the family grave at Rakowicki cemetery, where his parents and elder brother Edmund are buried.
Monuments to the pope are to be erected in several cities and towns around Poland, including Wadowice in the south, where the pope was born Karol Wojtyla on May 18, 1920, and at Pilsudski Square in the capital, Warsaw.
Pilsudski Square was one of the high holy places in John Paul II's pontificate, as it was there that on June 10, 1979 he uttered the memorable phrase: "May the spirit come down and renew the face of this land."
Those words were interpreted by many Poles as an exhortation to stand up to the communist regime and allow a new Poland to be born.
John Paul II died on April 2 in his private apartment in the Vatican after a 26 year pontificate.
Japan's Crown Price Naruhito joined 1500 Catholics, diplomats and government officials at a Tokyo church Friday in a mass to mourn Pope John Paul II ahead of his funeral at the Vatican.
Naruhito, on behalf of his father Emperor Akihito, took a deep bow before a photograph of the pope as he offered a small bouquet of white flowers at St Mary's Cathedral.
Political and religious leaders as well as royals from around the world are expected to attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II on Friday at the Vatican.
Japan has sent Yoriko Kawaguchi, special adviser to the prime minister and a former foreign minister.
Highly secular Japan has a miniscule Christian community, although Pope John Paul II was well regarded for making a 1981 appeal for peace when he visited atomic bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Pope John Paul II, who famously quipped that he would not know where to address a letter of resignation, revealed in his final testament that he considered stepping aside in 2000.
"I hope that He will help me to recognize how long I must continue this service," the testament reads.
"May the mercy of God give me the necessary strength for this service."
"According to the designs of Providence, I was given to live in the difficult century that is beginning to recede into the past," he wrote in March 2000.
"And now, in the year that will see my life reach the 80s, I must ask myself if the time has come to repeat with Simon in the Bible 'nunc dimittis'" the start of a phrase that translates as "Lord, lettest now Thy servant depart in peace according to Thy Word."
At the time, John Paul II's walk had begun to slow, his stoop was becoming more pronounced, and he was increasingly showing the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, which was already preventing him from speaking clearly on occasion.
The writing came two months after Karl Lehmann, the bishop of Mainz, Germany, sparked a row by intimating that John Paul II might consider stepping down if he felt that he could no longer carry out his duties, and that the Roman Catholic Church needed "a strong man, a leader."
John Paul II made what was seen as an indirect reference to the remarks when he said at the time: "God never asks us anything beyond our forces.
He gives us the strength to accomplish what he expects from us."
But in a letter marking the UN International Old People's Year in 1999 he wrote: "In spite of the limits imposed by age, I still have a taste for life.
I thank God for that."
Asked to comment on the revelation, Cardinal Desmond Connell of Dublin told AFP on Thursday: "That doesn't surprise me at all.
I would have expected John Paul II to be making provisions (for retirement).
"He knew his health was in decline and that there was a danger he would be unable to communicate."
The indefatigable John Paul II, who completed 104 foreign trips over his 26 year reign, would not have wanted to continue "if he would be unable to perform," Connell said.
"He had a very profound sense of responsibility."
In the weeks leading up to the pope's death last Saturday, Connell said he was worried that John Paul II was becoming too incapacitated to continue serving.
"I was somewhat nervous about it, I have to say," he said, adding however that he had not discussed it with other cardinals.
The pope never fully recovered from the 1981 shooting by Turkish terrorist Ali Agca, who badly wounded him.
By 2000, the pope had been hospitalized seven times since the start of his pontificate in 1978, undergoing surgery for a benign colon tumor, a shoulder problem, a fractured hip and appendicitis.
A pope is elected for life, and only six of John Paul II's 262 predecessors abdicated, the last one being Gregory XII in 1415.
None resigned because of ill health.
John Paul II said repeatedly that he would continue to lead the Church until his "last breath" a vow he managed to honor, ironically, despite the severe respiratory problems that sparked his final decline.
On the eve of John Paul II's funeral, around half a million people gathered Thursday in a vast field on the edge of the southern Polish city of Krakow for a mass in memory of the Polish born pope.
"We estimate the numbers at around 500000.
Blonia esplanade is beginning to fill up and people are still streaming in from Market Square," Krakow police spokeswoman Sylwia Bober told AFP.
A mass was due to be held at the esplanade and at 9:37 pm (1937 GMT), the precise time of John Paul II's death on Saturday, lit candles will be lifted skyward on the eve of his funeral.
The huge gathering had set off some two hours earlier from central Market Square in Krakow for a silent, white march in homage to John Paul II.
Leading the march, youths carried white flags and banners inscribed with the words "Holy father, we thank you."
Most of the participants were dressed in white, and some carried white flowers.
"For us, white is a symbolic colour, linked with the pope.
It is also the sign of hope.
We're not here in sadness even if the even is sad," said 21 year old theology student Lukasz Boronski.
"We thank the holy father for having left us so many gifts," he added.
"This is a tribute and also a message of hope.
I hope that after his death, the change will continue," said Katarzyna Kierzek, 22, a management student.
Engineering student Michal Skwarczynski, 21, said he had come to "pay homage to the holy father and the greatest Pole in history."
Just as was the case on Monday, when more than 150000 young people marched through the streets of Krakow in an impromptu tribute to John Paul II, news of the march was spread by the Internet and mobile telephone text messages.
A similar march was organised in Krakow in 1981, after the failed attempt on the life of John Paul II.
The next pope should not try to be another John Paul II, the Polish born pope's first private secretary, Irish Bishop John Magee, said Thursday.
Magee told journalists that the next pope should try to "be himself."
"I think it would be very wrong if a new pope would try to emulate what John Paul II had," he said.
Magee was private secretary to John Paul II from his election in 1978 until 1982 when he was succeeded by Polish Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, who was at the pontiff's bedside when he died last Saturday.
The Irish bishop, who was also private secretary to John Paul I during his ill fated 33 day reign as pontiff, also said John Paul II had bequeathed him something which he was not prepared to reveal.
"He left something very special for me, as a sign of his gratitude, but I'm not prepared to say what it is," he said, adding that Dziwisz had given it to him on his arrival in Rome on Sunday.
According to his final testament released Thursday by the Vatican, the pope left no personal property, instructing Dziwisz to burn all his personal notes.

The Washington Post: John Paul II Dies at 84.
John Paul II, the voyager pope who helped conquer communism and transformed the papacy with charisma and vigor, died Saturday night after a long battle with Parkinson's disease that became a lesson to the world in humble suffering, the paper said.
The Catholic Patriotic Association of China and the Chinese Catholic Bishops College sent a telegram Sunday morning to Vatican to express "deep condolence" over the demise of Pope John Paul II.
"It is very sorrowful to know that Pope John Paul II has passed away at the call of God, to rest in Lord for good," the telegraph reads.
"It would be a great loss for the pastoral and evangelical works of the Universal Church."
"We sincerely express our deep condolence, on behalf of more than 5 million clergies and faithfuls of the Catholic Church in China, and pray God grant him an eternal reward," it reads.

More Americans than ever are driving under the influence of their cell phones, according to a survey released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
The survey showed 8 percent of drivers, or 1.2 million people, were using hand held or handsfree cell phones during daylight hours last year, a 50 percent increase since 2002 and a 100 percent rise in four years.
All that talking is a potential safety issue, NHTSA spokesman Rae Tyson said Tuesday.
"While we don't have hard evidence that there's been an increase in the number of crashes, we know that talking on the phone can degrade driver performance," Tyson said.
New York, New Jersey and the District of Columbia prohibit talking on hand held cell phones while driving, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association.
Some communities, such as Brookline, Massachusetts, Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Lebanon, Pennsylvania, require handsfree cell phones, but about a half dozen states prohibit local governments from restricting cell phone use in motor vehicles.
Young drivers, between 16 and 24, increased their talking on cell phones by 60 percent between 2002 and 2004.
The National Transportation Safety Board said it wants all 50 states to ban those with learner's permits from using cell phones or other wireless devices while driving.
New Jersey and Maine are the only two that have passed such laws.
The survey was conducted between June 7 and July 11, 2004, at 1200 road sites across the country and, in some cases, supplemented by telephone surveys.
MIDWEST ILLINOIS: CHICAGO REGULATES CELL PHONE USE Chicago City Council approved an ordinance making it illegal to use a hand held cell phone while driving.
Starting in July, drivers could be fined $50 or up to $200 for a violation tied to a car accident.
The law does not apply to drivers who are using a hands free phone or are calling emergency numbers.
New York, New Jersey and Washington, D.C., have similar bans.
Louis Graham, the DeKalb County police chief, announced the formation of a five member cold case squad whose first task will be to reinvestigate five of the Atlanta child killings that terrified the city from 1979 to 1981.
Investigators said they would also look into the disappearance of a sixth victim who was found in Fulton County.
Graham reopened the case to try to determine whether Wayne Williams, a 23 year old music promoter who was sentenced to life for two of the killings, was responsible for at least 22 others.
Most of the victims were black boys.
A study of cellphone use by motorists suggests that they aren't any better off using a headset in the car than holding the phone to their ear: They're still four times as likely to end up in a crash and injured as drivers who stay off the phone altogether.
The survey, released Monday by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, said using mobile phones while driving was just as dangerous whether they're chatting through a headset or holding on to the handset.
The statistical analysis, which compared phone records with the times of accidents, indicated that the risk was just as great across all age groups and in both sexes.
It's not just keying in phone numbers or calling up messages but the conversation itself that can be the most distracting, said Anne T. McCartt, the insurance institute's research executive overseeing the study.
"There's the possibility that some technology in the future would eliminate distractions from using the phone in the car, but it's hard to think of any way to eliminate the distraction from the conversation," she said.
"Your brain can only perform so many tasks at once."
The American Insurance Association, a Washington, D.C., trade group for insurers, hailed the survey as a major advance in the emerging body of research on cellphone use by motorists.
"This study reinforces the fact that cellphone use is a major distraction and increases injury and death," said Julie Rochman, an executive with the group.
The research, to be published Tuesday in the British Medical Journal, drew on the experiences of about 500 drivers in Perth, Australia, who were treated in hospital emergency rooms after crashes from April 2002 to July 2004.
Using phone records, McCartt and researchers at the University of Sydney estimated the increased risk of injury by comparing the drivers' cellphone use as much as 10 minutes before their crashes occurred and at control intervals as much as a week earlier.
The institute had to go to Australia to conduct the survey because U.S. carriers would not permit a look at phone records to verify a driver's distraction at the time of a crash and to allow appropriate comparison periods.
McCartt said the city, with 1.3 million residents, was comparable to many U.S. cities.
Western Australia also bans the use of cellphones while driving unless hands free devices are used.
Still, about a third of the crash victims interviewed, she said, had been holding phones to their ears.
The results could bolster the wireless industry's arguments against hands free laws, or it could have the opposite effect of leading to bans on cellphone use altogether while driving.
"Based on our study, that would make some sense," McCartt said.
"But it would be very hard to enforce a law like that."
The institute, a nonprofit research group funded by U.S. insurers, has not taken a position on any legislation.
A hands free law, however, could at least help encourage drivers holding their cellphones to their ears to put them down, preventing some accidents, she said.
The proliferation of mobile phones the number of subscribers in the United States passed the number of land lines last fall has had profound effects on society.
The prospect that air travelers may soon be able to call while flying, for instance, has many people upset.
Cellphone customers spend more time talking on their phones while in their cars than anywhere else.
Last year, they spent 40 percent of their time on mobile phones while driving, compared with 24 percent while in the home, according to an April survey of consumer habits by the Yankee Group, a research firm in Boston.
The California Legislature is considering a law that would require motorists to use hands free devices either headsets or new wireless technology that turns radios into temporary phones.
A similar bill died in the Senate last fall.
And a bill to ban various driving distractions including smoking, eating and all cellphone use died in the Assembly.
"Clutching a cellphone to your ear means that in that split second in an emergency when you need both hands on the wheel, you won't have it.
And that could be the difference between life and death," said Democratic state Sen Joe Simitian, the measure's sponsor.
Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and the District of Columbia have banned the use of hand held cellphones while driving, mandating that motorists use headsets or other hands free devices instead.
So have Chicago and cities in five other states.
In New York, which passed the first such law in 2001, the insurance institute noted a 50 percent drop in motorists' use of cellphones, spokesman Russ Rader said.
But over time, usage rose to nearly where it was before as drivers ignored the $100 fine.
Federal bills in 2001 and 2003 didn't make it out of committees.
Mobile phone carriers and the wireless industry, through the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, have opposed any laws singling out mobile phones.
"Legislation is really the easy way out, but it's ineffectual," said John Walls, the trade group's chief spokesman.
"What we firmly believe in is that you empower people by educating them, making them aware of the right way to behave.
But looking at one distraction is not right."
Walls said any law would fail to deal with all driver distractions, such as passengers talking in the back seat or drivers eating or drinking.
Cellphone use, he said, is "no more or less distracting than any other distractions."
Insurers tend to agree but for different reasons.
Their trade group doesn't want traffic laws passed that aren't going to be enforced, Rochman said.
But a distraction that is four times as dangerous as when it isn't there is a major problem, McCartt said.
A passenger, for instance, can see what the driver sees and even warn of trouble ahead, but someone on the other end of a phone call has no idea what traffic is like, she noted.
"Lots of things are distracting," she said.
"The key for researchers is to look in terms of the bottom line serious crashes.
That's what this study adds."
Times staff writer Steven Bodzin in Washington contributed to this report.
A study of Australian drivers found that those using cell phones were four times as likely to be involved in a serious crash regardless of whether they used hands free devices like earpieces or speaker phones that have been perceived as making talking while driving safer.
The study, which is to appear in The British Medical Journal on Tuesday, is the first of its kind to use actual crash data and cell phone records to show a link between talking on the phone and being seriously injured in an accident.
It is also the first to definitively conclude outside of a laboratory setting that holding a phone to your ear and talking through a hands free device poses the same risks.
Because cell phone records are not considered public information, a similar study has not been conducted in the United States.
The most up to date research by the federal government has relied either on volunteers who were videotaped during a crash or on experiments in which a driver was monitored by researchers in a laboratory.
The new study examined the cell phone records of 744 drivers who had accidents in Perth, Australia, where drivers are required to use hands free devices.
Researchers estimated the time of the crash and looked at whether the driver used a cell phone in the minutes leading up to the accident.
They then examined similar time intervals in the days before the crash to calculate the increased risk of using the cellphone.
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a nonprofit research group in Virginia, sent researchers to three hospitals in Perth during a two year period from 2002 to 2004 to interview crash victims.
The researchers asked several questions, including whether the driver had a hands free device in the car and how often the device was used.
To avoid having drivers incriminate themselves, the researchers did not ask if a hands free apparatus was in use at the time of the crash.
Rather, they asked drivers how often they used such a device and factored that into determining the devices' effectiveness.
"There is no safety advantage associated with switching to the types of hands free devices that are commonly in use," the study concludes.
With several states restricting the use of cell phones in cars, the findings raise questions about how useful those laws are.
Currently, New York, New Jersey and the District of Columbia require drivers to use a hands free device.
Beginning Oct 1, Connecticut will also make holding a phone and driving illegal.
But as the Australian research and other recent studies show, it is the act of talking, not holding a phone, that is the most distracting.
"There just doesn't seem to be any safety benefit by restricting drivers to hands free phones," Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said.
"It's the cognitive overload that sometimes occurs when you're engaging in a conversation that is the source of the distraction more so than the manipulation of the device."
A spokesman for the New York's Department of Motor Vehicles said the department was conducting a study of the way cell phone use affects driving and would report the findings to the Legislature before the end of the year.
That report could include recommendations for additional restrictions on using cell phones while driving, the spokesman, Christine Burling, said.
The Australian study notes not only that cell phone laws are hard to enforce but that more restrictive measures there appear unlikely.
"While a possible solution in the future is to change mobile phones so they cannot be used when vehicles are in motion," the Australian study said, "the likelihood the industry would embrace such a change seems remote."
Paul A. Green, a scientist at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, said studies like this could serve as a wake up call to lawmakers.
"They're most convinced by the tombstone count," he said.
"And I think this does a lot, especially when it comes to policy."
In driving school, they teach everything from how to parallel park to how to change lanes.
What they don't explain is how to drive and talk on a cell phone at the same time.
On Wednesday, Texas lawmakers decided they are ready to step in.
The House tentatively passed a measure that prohibits a minor from using a wireless communications device, including cell phones and pagers, for six months after getting a driver's license.
Rep Jose Menendez, D San Antonio, attached the measure to a Senate bill that deals with commercial driver's licenses.
"I am hoping to get the next generation of drivers used to not using cell phones," Menendez said.
"I think we can make all streets in Texas safer."
The amendment was adopted without much debate and without recording the vote, but members tried to reconsider their decision after realizing what the measure entailed.
That motion, however, failed 61 77.
Menendez initially wanted a broader ban but had no success in getting it heard.
The amendment adopted, though, also prohibits a person younger than 17 from using a wireless communications device while driving a motorcycle or moped during the first six months.
Rep Joe Nixon, R Houston, said although it may be a good idea, the language in the amendment is too vague.
He said it isn't clear whether law enforcement officers would be able to stop anyone who they think is younger than 18 and might have a cell phone.
"Do you have to turn off the car and get out of the car to talk on the phone?"
Nixon asked.
Nixon said adopting this clause would also add a new category of probable cause and give officials another reason to stop suspects.
Once the police stop someone, they can search the entire vehicle, he said.
The measure that was adopted Wednesday also prohibits a new driver from wearing a headset and talking on the phone.
Nixon said that may cause problems.
"What if someone is following you and you want to call the police?" he said.
"The police can help you, but then they would have to give you a ticket for calling them."
The bill now goes back to the Senate, where lawmakers can either accept the Menendez amendment or ask to go to a conference committee.
Sen Jon Lindsay, R Houston, the bill's author, said although he wouldn't be in favor of a broader ban, he welcomes the amendment that was added.
"Young drivers need to learn how to drive first," Lindsay said.
"I have enough experience with young drivers to know they should not have their attention diverted to other things."
Several other lawmakers this session filed bills relating to the regulation of cell phones while driving, but none got anywhere.
The bills included prohibiting the use of phones while driving through a school zone and outlawing everything but the use of headsets.
Menendez said he hopes the legislation adopted Wednesday will lead driving schools to teach about the dangers of talking and operating a vehicle at the same time.
After her family completed their testimony on the dangers of cell phone use while driving, Kellie Leas walked over to Michelle Grisham and gave her a hug.
As Kellie, 23, walked back to her seat, Michelle, 17, wiped away tears.
"We had never met before," Grisham said.
"But when you meet someone who's been through a similar situation, you feel so close."
Grisham had accompanied her mother, Dorothy Grisham, from Fort Worth to Austin to testify before the House State Affairs Committee on Monday on three bills restricting the use of cell phones while driving.
Brandon Grisham died in an automobile accident in 2001.
The 18 year old lost control of his pickup after swerving to mis another vehicle that veered into his lane.
His mother, Dorothy Grisham, said a witness told her that the woman in the other vehicle appeared distracted by her cell phone.
"The lady never stopped and is still at large," Dorothy Grisham told the committee.
Kellie Leas, 23, of San Antonio, lost her sister, Erin, in October 2001, after Erin crashed into a tree while talking on her cell phone.
Patrick Leas, Erin's father, told the anel about his last moments with her, right before she was taken off life support.
"I had my hand on her chest and I could feel her little heart," he said.
The House committee considered four bills on the issue.
Three were proposed by state Rep Jose Menendez, D San Antonio.
Two would prohibit drivers from using cell phones while driving through school zones and drivers under 18 from using a cell phone for the first six months after gettinga license.
Those two bills received strong support from experts and no opposition.
A bill proposed by state Rep Helen Giddings, D Dallas, to restrict cell phone use by school bus drivers, also faced no opposition.
Menendez's third bill would bar the use of cell phones while driving unless the driver is using a hands free device or making an emergency call.
Only one telecommunications industry lobbyist spoke against that bil. "Hands free technology is not the silver bullet," Henry Flores, a lobbyist for Sprint, told the committee.
He cited research showing hands free devices aren't less distracting for a driver than a handheld phone.
All the cell phone related bills were held by the committee until similar legislation now being drafted could be reviewed.
Bills under consideration in the Texas House: House Bill 236 would prohibit a driver fromusing a cell phone while driving through a school zone.
House Bill 237 would prohibit cell phone use unless a driver is using a hands free device or making an emergency call.
House Bill 610 would restrict cell phone use by school bus drivers while operating a bus with passengers.
House Bill 1094 would prohibit use of a cell phone by a driver under 18 during the six months period following issuance of a license.

Christina Arnold was pulled over by a Washington police officer last summer for driving while talking on her cell phone without a hands free device.
Hoping to avoid a $100 ticket, Arnold explained to the officer that she had an important call from her daughter's school and even offered to show him her telephone record.
He declined, she said, and she managed to get off with just a warning.
But thousands of other drivers in Washington the have not been as lucky.
Although only the District of Columbia, New York state and New Jersey have passed legislation banning the use of hand held cell phones while driving, they have issued more than 400000 tickets and warnings since New York enacted the first such law in 2001.
In Washington and New York, the hands free law is a primary violation, meaning the driver can be pulled over just for that violation, whereas in New Jersey it is a secondary offense, which means the driver must be stopped for another offense.
Several other states are considering hand held bans, including Maryland, which may prohibit youthful drivers from using cell phones after a spate of fatal car accidents involving teenage drivers.
In Washington, law enforcement officials can issue either a warning ticket or a $100 citation.
But if a cited driver brings a hands free device to adjudication, the fine is waived.
But this only works once.
Although Arnold, 29, did not get an official warning, she took the advice of the officer who stopped her and bought a hands free device.
"It cost only about $59 for the headset, which is good insurance against any $100 tickets," said Arnold, who works for a nongovernmental organization.
"That's a definite deterrent never to talk on my phone again."
Washington police have been issuing about 600 tickets and 250 warnings each month since the law was enacted last August.
New York, which has issued more than 360000 tickets since December 2001, has issued more each year.
About 60 percent of the tickets were issued in New York City.
But with cell phone related incidents only a small percentage of motor vehicle accidents, even government officials wonder why this particular behavior was chosen for a law, since studies have shown that hands free and hand held cell phones are equally distracting.
"We've evaluated and come to the conclusion that hands free use is just as risky or perhaps riskier than hand held phones because it's the cognitive distraction that can compromise driving," said Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Tyson said research from within and outside the agency, along with driving simulations, had found that it was the talking on a cell phone while driving that was distracting, and that therefore cell phones should only be used in emergencies.
Even the AAA of America, the automobile organization that helped draft Washington's hands free law, believes that the real issue is cell phones, in general, which cause distracted driving, said John B. Townsend II, manager of public and government relations for AAA Mid Atlantic.
He cited an AAA analysis of 50 traffic fatalities over a fixed period of time in the Washington area that found only two that possibly involved cell phone use.
"In the cosmic scheme of things, it's not just the cell phone," Townsend said.
"We would not come right out and support a ban on hand held cell phones.
That's not the issue the real issue is distracted drivers."
But the laws could be in response to people's fears rather than fast and hard evidence, Townsend said.
A survey by AAA Mid Atlantic showed that 63 percent of motorists favored a ban on driving with hand held cell phones (76 percent in Washington), with those favoring bans directed at new teenage drivers rising to 79 percent.
Results of the survey, culled from 1300 interviews in the Mid Atlantic area in December 2003, also showed that 71 percent of drivers felt distracted using a cell phone while driving.
But John Walls, the vice president of public affairs of CTIA, the Wireless Association, a trade organization representing wireless interests, said it was unfair and unnecessary to create hands free laws.
"We question the need for a law singling out behavior that apparently is pretty far down the pecking order of accidents in the first place," Walls said.
He cited statistics showing that before 2001, the year the law New York law was enacted, fewer than a hundredth of 1 percent of New York City accidents were related to cell phones.
But a spokesman for the New York Department of Motor Vehicles, Joseph Picchi, said that he thought the law was having an impact but that the department was still compiling statistics.
A report is due by the end of 2005.
Picchi pointed out that the law requiring seat belts in automobiles had taken years to catch on but now had a compliance rate of 85 percent.
"Cell phones are one of the bigger distractions while driving," said Picchi said.
Lt. Byron Hope, traffic safety coordinator for the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, said that it was too early to judge the effectiveness of the law, but that it made people aware of their driving habits.
"There had to be some instances where people's driving was so bad that this law was sparked," he said.
"We're not saying you can't talk on your cell phone.
We just ask people to use some discretion."
Michael Trujillo is beginning to sound like an outlaw.
He has turned against a law he was instrumental in passing.
As vice chairman of the Public Safety Committee for Santa Fe, N.M., Trujillo supported and promoted the city's adoption three years ago of a ban on the use of all but hands free cell phones while driving.
"I was seeing people run into things, and it was happening because they were on their cell phones," said Trujillo, who owns a valet parking service.
He left the committee in December, but his feelings about the law changed long before that.
"In the beginning I pushed it pretty hard," he said.
"But then I realized, 'God, how stupid is this law?"'
Leaving the hands free had the potential to increase, not decrease, driver distraction, he said.
"If you have hands free, not only are you able to do something else, but you are able to do three different tasks at the same time."
He now thinks the law should be scrapped.
Since New York passed the nation's first statewide law banning hand held cell phones while driving four years ago, New Jersey and Washington, D.C., have followed with laws that went into effect last summer.
Some cities, like Santa Fe, have passed similar legislation, and more than a dozen states have partial bans or bills pending.
The laws have often been ignored, and enforcement has been spotty at best.
Some drivers are not even aware they are breaking the law.
A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration survey, released Tuesday, showed that more people than ever are phoning while driving, and only a small percentage are using headsets.
"People are ignoring it," said Steve Carrellas, New Jersey coordinator for the National Motorists Association, speaking of that state's law.
"It's just like the 55 mile per hour speed limit.
Despite what people say in polls, what the vast majority of people are actually doing is not complying with it."
But cell phones, hands free or hand held, are just a part of the greater problem of driver distraction, one that may become worse with the spread of technology.
No one doubts that using a cell phone can cause lapses in attention.
Anyone who has groped for a phone bleating at the bottom of a purse or dialed while at the steering wheel knows this.
The question, at one time, was whether that was any worse than, say, unwrapping a cheeseburger or lighting a cigarette.
Now it's also a question of whether a cell phone is more of a hazard than playing a DVD, using the calendar or e mail functions on a wireless hand held device, or picking out a playlist on an iPod.
A few states have laws related to watching movies and television while driving, or placing a TV in front of the driver.
But what if the cell phone screen doubles as a TV?
Of if the phone can take pictures?
Or the organizer can send instant messages?
Or the dashboard has an ever present electronic map?
This, in part, is what inspired Trujillo to take a stand.
"There isn't a law that will be able to catch up," he said.
"If you ban cell phones, then someone else will come up with something else."
Matt Sundeen, a policy analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures who focuses on transportation, agreed.
"Driver distraction has been an issue since the car has been around," he said.
"But now you have all these different technologies where legislators can't possibly write legislation for specific technologies.
It's impossible to keep pace."
The result, Sundeen said, is a trend toward legislation that is worded more broadly to address the new behaviors.
The Washington, D.C., law, for example, not only requires that mobile phones be equipped with a hands free accessory but also prohibits reading, writing and "using personal communications technologies."
Sundeen said it was hard to gauge whether any of the laws had helped to reduce the number of traffic accidents.
"It is difficult to determine what role, if any, a cell phone plays in most car accidents," he said.
"Even if you can correlate the exact moment of the crash with phone records, you don't know if it's the cause or not."
Dr David Strayer, a professor of psychology at the University of Utah who studies driver distraction, said laws like those in New York and New Jersey were well intentioned and "not an unreasonable first attempt to solve the problem."
But, he said, "they make an error in assuming that it can be remedied by a hands free cell phone."
He added: "The laws could very plausibly be counterproductive if they give people the message that a hand held phone is unsafe but a hands free phone is safe.
You're encouraging people to engage in a type of activity that is no more safe than the old way of talking on a cell phone."
Even before the New York law went into effect, studies indicated that it was the distraction of the conversation itself, not the act of dialing or holding the phone, that accounted for most of the increased risk.
"There is really good evidence from six independent studies from five different labs that have all come to the same conclusions," Strayer said.
"There is no difference between hand held and hands free cell phone use while driving."
He continued: "The main source of the interference is mental, cognitive.
It turns out you're tuning out some important details about driving.
When using a cell phone, peoples' eyes will go to a place or thing, but they won't see it.
It won't register."
Hall Smyth, an exhibition designer who lives in Pond Eddy, N.Y., and has an office in Queens, two hours away by car, said he had experienced the opposite phenomenon.
"If I need to attend to the driving, I fade out of the conversation," he said.
"But I can see you'd easily do it the other way."
Smyth no longer uses a hand held phone while driving, however, after an encounter with a New York City police officer.
For months after the state's hands free requirement went into effect in 2001, Smyth simply ignored it, chatting away practically nonstop during his long drives into New York City.
Then he was pulled over one day in Manhattan.
"I was just driving down Seventh Avenue and a police van pulled me over," he said.
"I couldn't believe they actually enforced it."
Were it not for the $95 ticket, he said, it is very likely that he would still be driving with the phone virtually cemented to his ear.
Other drivers don't willfully disobey the law, they just aren't aware of it.
The ban in New Jersey has not been a problem for Mireya Ortiz.
She didn't know it existed.
"Are you serious?"
Ortiz said after maneuvering her car into a parking space in Jersey City, mascara wand in hand.
"In New York I knew about it, but not here."
Ortiz, a social worker who lives in North Bergen, N.J., has spent years using her car as an ersatz phone booth.
Her three teenagers call her cell phone often, and when she isn't taking calls from her children, she is talking to friends in New York and Miami.
Ortiz said she found out about the New York ban only after a friend was stopped there for driving without a headset.
Yet Ortiz has no plans to buy a headset, even for improved safety.
"I just can't stand them," she said.
If she gets pulled over, she plans to employ the same tactics that her friend did.
"Oh, she just flirted out of it, you know," Ortiz said.
"She didn't get the ticket."
Hands free setups are far from ideal.
Tommy O'Dea, an electrical contractor in Manhattan, has a cradle glued to his car's console, a microphone on the visor and a speaker mounted under the dashboard.
"A lot of people complain that I sound very far away," he said.
"And if I have the window rolled down and I'm on the highway, I find myself shouting."
Katie McCormick Lelyveld has come up with a creative way to conform to at least the spirit of the ban in Washington, D.C.
While she doesn't often use her headset with her BlackBerry phone, she doesn't hold it up to her ear, either.
Instead, she uses the speakerphone and drives her Lexus SUV with her phone in her lap or in the car door.
"It's not worth getting caught," she said.
McCormick Lelyveld's car does not have a navigation system or a DVD player, but she does run her iPod through her radio, necessitating the occasional adjustment of the click wheel.
Her speakerphone has become something of a style statement.
"I kind of like the idea of having people think I'm talking to myself," she said.
Reading and responding to e mail messages while driving, an act that requires multiple finger taps and focusing on a small screen, can be a major distraction.
Although McCormick Lelyveld no longer subscribes to the e mail service on the BlackBerry, she confessed that when she did, she read a message or two in the car.
But Christine Nesbit, a lawyer in Eugene, Ore., where there is no law related to cell phone use, would never do such a thing.
Nesbit owns a BlackBerry that receives e mail messages, but she turns off the alert when she is driving.
Her self discipline came as a result of having worked as a prosecutor for the Eugene Municipal Court, where she frequently handled traffic cases.
"What you learn is that if you are doing anything that impairs your perception and your ability to do this incredibly multifaceted job of driving safely, it's dangerous."
Trujillo cannot claim to be so virtuous.
His Treo cell phone is fully enabled with the e mail feature.
Does he ever check e mail in the car?
"I couldn't lie to you," he said.
"Yes.
But I only do it at stop signs and stoplights."
IN U.S., POLITICIANS FIND IT HARD TO KEEP MOTORISTS OFF THE PHONE By KATIE HAFNER When it comes to prohibiting cell phone use in cars, the United States lags far behind other parts of the world.
Using a hand held phone while driving is banned in some 45 countries, including Australia, Germany, France, Britain and Japan.
In the United States, state and municipal laws vary widely.
Among states, only New York and New Jersey have full bans, as does the District of Columbia.
Some other states have partial bans.
In Maine, for instance, drivers with a learner's permit may not use a hand held cell phone, and in Arkansas, Massachusetts and a handful of other states, school bus drivers are prohibited from using phones except in an emergency.
In Delaware, although there is no law specifically related to cell phones, a driver can be prosecuted for "inattentive driving," which can include using a mobile phone.
A list of state laws, pending legislation and laws in other countries is at cellular news.com/car(USCORE)bans/.
Even in countries where the laws are strictly enforced, compliance isn't what it could be.
"The police here are strict but you still see quite a few people with phone held up to their ear," said Bill Howard, who lives in Bittern, a town near Melbourne, Australia.
Howard said his 22 year old daughter was once pulled over while holding her phone in her hand but not talking on it.
Within the last five years every state has considered some type of bill restricting cell phone use by motorists, but the bills seldom pass, said Matt Sundeen, a policy analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Connecticut, Georgia and Nebraska have had multiple bills introduced that were defeated.
"Unlike something like drunk driving, there's no national consensus on this," Sundeen said.
"So there's less pressure on states to act." Several states have passed legislation preventing local governments from enacting or enforcing their own bans.
In Florida, for example, a number of towns and Miami Dade County had laws in place that were pre empted by the Legislature.
After her family completed their testimony on the dangers of cell phone use while driving, Kellie Leas walked over to Michelle Grisham and gave her a hug.
As Kellie, 23, walked back to her seat, Michelle, 17, wiped away tears.
"We had never met before," Grisham said.
"But when you meet someone who's been through a similar situation, you feel so close."
Grisham had accompanied her mother, Dorothy Grisham, from Fort Worth to Austin to testify before the House State Affairs Committee on Monday on three bills restricting the use of cell phones while driving.
Brandon Grisham died in an automobile accident in 2001.
The 18 year old lost control of his pickup after swerving to miss another vehicle that veered into his lane.
His mother, Dorothy Grisham, said a witness told her that the woman in the other vehicle appeared distracted by her cell phone.
"The lady never stopped and is still at large," Dorothy Grisham told the committee.
Kellie Leas, 23, of San Antonio, lost her sister, Erin, in October 2001, after Erin crashed into a tree while talking on her cell phone.
Patrick Leas, Erin's father, told the panel about his last moments with her, right before she was taken off life support.
"I had my hand on her chest and I could feel her little heart," he said.
The House committee considered four bills on the issue.
Three were proposed by state Rep Jose Menendez, D San Antonio.
Two would prohibit drivers from using cell phones while driving through school zones and drivers under 18 from using a cell phone for the first six months after getting a license.
Those two bills received strong support from experts and no opposition.
A bill proposed by state Rep Helen Giddings, D Dallas, to restrict cell phone use by school bus drivers, also faced no opposition.
Menendez's third bill would bar the use of cell phones while driving unless the driver is using a hands free device or making an emergency call.
Only one telecommunications industry lobbyist spoke against that bill.
"Hands free technology is not the silver bullet," Henry Flores, a lobbyist for Sprint, told the committee.
He cited research showing hands free devices aren't less distracting for a driver than a handheld phone.
All the cell phone related bills were held by the committee until similar legislation now being drafted could be reviewed.
Bills under consideration in the Texas House: House Bill 236 would prohibit a driver from using a cell phone while driving through a school zone.
House Bill 237 would prohibit cell phone use unless a driver is using a hands free device or making an emergency call.
House Bill 610 would restrict cell phone use by school bus drivers while operating a bus with passengers.
House Bill 1094 would prohibit use of a cell phone by a driver under 18 during the six months period following issuance of a license.

Erin Leas was grounded, but her mom let her out anyway.
She'd been well behaved and really wanted to see her boyfriend.
It was a beautiful outside, and the 16 year old high school cheerleader called on the way home to say, "I had the best day of my life."
She never made it home.
Making one more call to her boyfriend that October day in 2001, Erin lost control of her car and hit a cedar tree.
"She was gone," said her father, Patrick Leas.
He testified Monday to the House State Affairs Committee of the Texas Legislature in favor of several bills that would restrict the use of cell phones while driving.
"You may not think this is the most important bill, but look into the eyes of Erin's sister, her mother and her brother, and tell them it's not important," he said.
The proposals to curb cell phone use include three sponsored by Rep Jose Menendez (D).
House Bill 237 would make it a misdemeanor for drivers to use their cell phones unless they're using a hands free device, the vehicle is stopped or it's an emergency.
House Bill 236 would restrict cell phone use while driving in a school zone.
House Bill 1094 would make it an offense for minors to use cell phones while driving for the first six months after getting a license.
A proposal by Rep Helen Giddings (D) would make it illegal for school bus drivers to use a phone while operating the vehicle.
The bills were left pending in committee and likely will be taken up later this month.
The Senate is to hear similar legislation in two weeks.
"We're asking folks to pay attention to what they're doing, to keep both hands on the wheel and eliminate some of the distractions," said Menendez, who unsuccessfully pushed similar legislation in 2003.
According to the most recent data from the Texas Department of Public Safety, cell phone related accidents jumped from 716 in 2000 to 1032 in 2001 a 44 percent increase.
Another report by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates 3 percent of drivers are talking on hand held phones at any given time of the day.
A partial or full ban on cell phone use by drivers exists in New York, New Jersey and the District of Columbia and is being considered by 16 other states.
Cell phone industry representatives say drivers also are distracted by changing CDs, smoking or eating.

It's the law that nearly everyone supports and nearly everyone ignores.
In the year and a half since Washington D.C. began restricting drivers' cell phone use, police say they have issued thousands of tickets to violators.
But for every driver silenced with a $100 fine, many others are still out there talking on hand held phones, casually disregarding the law.
"Everybody does it," said Ann Edwards, a retiree who lives on Capitol Hill, "and I think it's dangerous."
The lack of compliance is common talk in the city.
On radio talk shows, callers often complain about drivers weaving down streets with cell phones stuck to their ears.
Many say they spot police officers violating the law.
On his monthly call in show, D.C.
Police Chief Charles Ramsey is often challenged about his commitment to enforcing it.
He said officers ticket people all the time.
"The numbers bear that out if they see it, they write it," Ramsey said in a recent interview.
"Sometimes an officer uses discretion.
I don't know if they're going to stop for a cell phone when they're going to a robbery in progress.
Sometimes things get busy."
And Ramsey urged people to report any officers they see breaking the law.
Last year, D.C. police officers issued 6018 tickets for driving with a hand held cell phone, said Lt. Byron Hope of the Traffic Safety and Special Enforcement Branch.
This January, 370 tickets were issued, he said.
Police began enforcing the law in August 2004.
Reaction to D.C.'s law one of the first in the country shows how ambivalent the public is about having anything, even safety, interfere with the beloved cell phone.
And it underscores how completely, and in such a short time, the device has come to dominate people's lives.
Cell phone users in the United States have increased from 34 million a decade ago to more than 203 million, according to CTIA the Wireless Association, and the debate about the technological phenomenon has only begun.
At least 25 state legislatures are considering restrictions on cell phone use while driving, many aimed at young drivers.
But an argument is growing that laws requiring hands free devices might contribute to hazards by encouraging drivers to talk longer.
The emphasis on cell phones also discounts other activities that take people's eyes and minds off the road.
"The real issue is driving while distracted," Ramsey said.
"The cell phone has just been the poster child."
The automobile group AAA agrees, urging drivers to use cell phones only in emergencies and saying the rush to enact new laws is "probably sending the wrong message," said spokesman Mantill Williams.
"It's almost like a useless law to a certain extent," Williams said.
"It sounds good, and politicians love it because it makes it sound like they're doing something.
But hands free is not risk free.
It's not a safety device, it's just a convenience device."
New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Washington D.C. have the most restrictive laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Last year, Maryland legislators prohibited drivers younger than 18 from using any cell phone.
This year, a Virginia bill that would prohibit 16 and 17 years olds from talking on the phone while driving passed the state Senate but was killed in a House subcommittee.
The Senate killed a bill this session to require hands free phones for all drivers.
Police have no data on whether the D.C. law has reduced the number of accidents.
And Russ Rader, spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, said he is not aware of any studies looking at the city law's effect on safety.
Anecdotal evidence is also sketchy.
Tow truck operators said they have seen no difference in accidents.
Several local insurance offices said the issue rarely comes up.
"The only reason it would end up in a report is if the insured indicates the crash was due to the cell phone, and we very rarely include it in our reports," said Olya Mikhailova of Georgetown Insurance Group.
But there is plenty of evidence that cell phone use is a major distraction.
A recent study by the insurance institute said drivers who use any cell phones were four times more likely to get into crashes serious enough to cause injury.
In another recent study, the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute found that fatigue was the most frequent cause of accidents.
Taking eyes off the road was second and the longer the eyes were away, the more likely a crash.
"Obviously, if you're dialing a cell phone, you're going to take your eyes off the road longer than if you're popping a CD in," said Sherry Box, spokeswoman for the Transportation Institute.
Linda Garcia, director of the communications, culture and technology program at Georgetown University, said the cell phone lends itself to "multitasking," often the goal of area workaholics, but at a price.
"I think we give up a certain amount of autonomy to the machines we use they govern us rather than vice versa," she said.
Garcia compares the public attitude about the D.C. law to the initial reaction to seat belt laws first came resistance and a minimum of enforcement, then crash data and public awareness campaigns gradually prompted the public to buckle up.
Mayor Anthony A. Williams, D, says the police department "is doing a very good job of striking a balance between zealous enforcement and educating drivers."
Ramsey said local drivers are starting to comply more, in part because ear devices have become "cool, almost a status thing."
Studies by the insurance institute showed that hand held phone use in Washington decreased from 6.1 percent of drivers to 3.5 percent right after the new law went into effect, Rader said.
A recent follow up survey showed the reduction has held steady, he said.
But in New York, he said, similar studies showed that hand held use returned to old levels after an initial drop.

Beginning Monday, Colorado is banning young drivers from talking on cellular phones while they're behind the wheel a small step more states are taking in hopes of promoting safety without upsetting voters who can't live without the convenience.
The Colorado law affects teens with restricted licenses brand new drivers who must have an adult drive with them for a year.
Police can issue a citation only if the driver is stopped for another violation.
This year, 38 states tried to pass legislation restricting cell phones, most focusing on younger drivers and driving while distracted.
Bills were passed or are still being considered in 22 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver.
So far, only New York, New Jersey, the District of Columbia and Connecticut prohibit the use of hand held phones while driving, though other states have adopted limited restrictions for young drivers or school bus drivers.
Most states are looking at limited bans because it is unclear and a bone of contention with the telecommunications industry whether cell phone use while driving can be tied to more accidents.
"For lawmakers, it's a foot in the door," said Matt Sundeen, a policy researcher with the legislatures group.
States are willing to take "baby steps" with younger drivers because it's easier to get the legislation passed, Sundeen said.
He said many lawmakers oppose stronger laws because they don't want to anger their constituents.
It is difficult to assess the effectiveness of cell phone bans because a lot of laws rely on drivers or witnesses to confirm they were talking on the phone when they had an accident.
Sundeen said it is more difficult to prosecute such cases, unlike drunken driving or failure to use a seat belt where there is often clear evidence.
The cell phone industry says studies show cell phone use was a factor in less than 1 percent of all accidents in the six states that require reporting.
Drivers using cell phones even hands free models are four times more likely to get into a serious injury crash, according to a study being released today.
The findings suggest that laws banning handheld cell phones give drivers a false sense of security and that perhaps it's time to consider an all out prohibition on talking behind the wheel, according to the nonprofit Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which released the report and noted that it is the first to quantify the injury risk of cell phones and driving.
"What this research will do is add to the body of evidence that both hands free and handheld phones pose a risk while driving," said Russ Rader, a spokesman for the institute, which is funded by auto insurers.
"The bottom line is that people should not be talking on cell phones while they're driving.
They should not be talking on cell phones of any kind while they're driving."
The rapid proliferation of cell phones last week it was reported that cell phones have overtaken land lines in the United States and that nearly half of all drivers use them behind the wheel has increasingly been a source of tension on the road.
One in three drivers said their greatest aggravation on the road is cell phone use by other drivers, according to one of the recent studies.
Every state has at some point considered legislation on cell phones behind the wheel, while a few states have banned phones unless they're hands free devices, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
California still has no such laws banning cell phones for drivers although one law prohibits bus drivers from talking while behind the wheel.
A pilot study in 2001 found that cell phone use in California was the No. 1 culprit in crashes in which driver distraction was cited as the cause.
"We have often made the argument that it's the conversation, and perhaps dialing the phone, that are the distractions," said Tom Marshall, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol.
Marshall said the department is still weighing whether prohibitions would help.
"In our mind, it's still a tossup whether hands free or handheld (prohibitions would help)."
But the national wireless association says cell phones shouldn't be singled out without considering all the distractions drivers experience while in their vehicles the burgers, the coffee, the kids who need attention.
"We've always said it can be a potential distraction," said John Walls, a spokesman for CTIA The Wireless Association, the trade association representing such wireless carriers as Cingular and Verizon as well as phone makers and other industry related companies.
"To address the issue of distracted driving, you really should look at the totality of the issue and not just look at one behavior because a lot of people do it.
"If someone wants to go to that degree, at the same time, we'd have to look at banning all those distractive behaviors, to be fair.
Let's look at banning drive through restaurants.
Let's look at banning radios."
The study examined the cell phone records of crash victims interviewed in emergency rooms between April 2002 and July 2004.
It found a consistent fourfold increased risk of injury among drivers on cell phones be they men or women, older or younger drivers.
The institute conducted the study in Western Australia because it said U.S. phone companies would not allow its researchers access to personal phone records.
CTIA could not comment on that claim.
Researchers also wanted to test the risks in that area of Australia where there has been a ban on using handheld devices.
One third of the drivers said their calls had been made on handheld phones, the study said.
"The problem with the laws that are being passed is they are leaving people with the impression that hands free phones are safer and they're clearly not," Rader said.
"We think that laws banning both types of cell phone use while driving are probably a good idea, but the big problem with that is how do you enforce it?
It's difficult to identify a driver using a hands free phone."
Rader disputed the industry's assertion that cell phones shouldn't be singled out as a problem.
"This is a distraction that tends to last over a period of time," Rader said.
"It's not a moment, a distraction of changing the radio station or talking to your child in the back seat.
It's a distraction that lasts a period of minutes.
"The body of evidence is pointing toward the conversation as being a major distraction when driving and talking on the cell phone."
Everyone complains about Massachusetts' high automobile insurance rates.
But what are you willing to give up to do something about it?
It is no secret why we have some of the highest rates in the country: Massachusetts leads the nation in accidents 40 percent higher than the state with the second highest rate, Rhode Island.
Since the day that maniac Paul Revere roared through the city's narrow streets at midnight, we Bostonians have considered bad driving a birthright.
And every year we get to pay for it come premium time.
There is plenty we could do that would make driving safer and lower rates though it sometimes involves surrendering a piece of our cherished "personal freedoms."
Here are three ideas we should consider: Buckle up or pay up.
The new push in the Legislature to require drivers to wear seat belts is a good place to start.
That Massachusetts drivers rank ahead of only those in Mississippi in wearing seat belts is an embarrassment, but says much about our attitudes about driving.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, seat belt usage in Massachusetts stands at 64.8 percent, compared to 82 percent nationwide.
Twenty two states and the District of Columbia allow the police to stop drivers solely for not wearing a seat belt.
In Massachusetts, drivers can be ticketed only if they have been stopped for another offense.
Everyone knows wearing a seat belt is the right thing to do.
(Correction: New Hampshire, of course, has no adult seat belt law at all.)
The Legislature has twice come within a vote of doing the right thing.
To do the wrong thing three times in a row is just plain stupid.
Put down the cellphone.
Talking on your cellphone while driving is a bad idea.
It is obvious whether you have been nearly rear ended by the fool gabbing on his cellphone in the next car or done it yourself.
Many of us have.
Plenty of studies have confirmed the obvious.
Drivers using cellphones are four times as likely to get into crashes serious enough to send them to the hospital, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
Harvard University's Center for Risk Analysis estimated 2600 people are killed and 330000 injured a year because of drivers talking on their cellphones and that was three years ago.
And evidence is mounting that using a hands free device instead of a hand held phone while behind the wheel does little to improve safety, and may even give drivers a false sense of security.
New York, New Jersey, and Washington, D.C., among others, have banned the use of hand held sets while driving.
The powerful cellphone industry, with much to lose, is the biggest obstacle to regulation.
And our own compulsive behavior.
Use the technology.
Running red lights is the leading cause of urban accidents, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, causing more than 200000 crashes and 900 deaths every year.
In response, 15 states and the District of Columbia have passed legislation allowing cities and towns to use video cameras to ticket violators.
This is hardly radical stuff: In 1910, Massachusetts once used a device known as a photo speed recorder, and its use was upheld by the Supreme Judicial Court.
The so called automatic enforcement technology photographs the license plates of cars as they are going through red lights, and civil citations are mailed to violators.
Used at problem intersections, cameras are a powerful and cost effective deterrent to impatient drivers.
The technology is not popular with the live free or die crowd, but civil citations have been widely upheld by the courts.
The privacy issue is a red herring, people simply don't like tickets.
What are you willing to give up to make the highways safer?
If the answer is none of the above, then stop complaining and send in your insurance premium.

A proposal in Olympia to ban driving while talking on hand held cell phones crashed in the state House.
"They completely gutted it," Federal Way Democratic Sen Tracey Eide said Wednesday.
Eide's bill would have outlawed talking on a cell phone while driving unless drivers were using headsets or other hands free devices.
It passed the state Senate but ran into fierce opposition in the House.
The House wrote a neutered version that prohibits driving and talking on a cell phone for only people who have an instruction permit or an intermediate driver's license given to someone under age 18.
Rep Ed Murray, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said gutting it was the only way to get the bill through his committee.
"I was one of the only votes" for Eide's original bill, said Murray, a Democrat from Seattle.
Opponents had a wide range of arguments.
Some said it was another case of big government.
Others said using a hands free device wouldn't be less distracting than just gabbing on the cell phone.
Rep Jeff Morris, an Anacortes Democrat on the transportation committee, said inattentive driving is already an infraction.
"The problem with her bill is that it picks out one piece of technology," Morris said.
He said he didn't want to target just cell phones since global positioning devices and other electronics are just as distracting.
Eide was upset.
She's been pushing the bill in Olympia for the past seven years.
She said constituents are tired of seeing people chatting on their cell phones when they should have both hands on the wheel.
Eide thought this would be the year because most of the telecom companies dropped their opposition to the bill.
"I'm going to come back with it next year," she said.
If you drive on Lackland Air Force Base, it's time to turn off your cell phone or risk being grounded.
Lackland is the first Air Force base in Texas' Bexar County to enforce a ban on use of cell phones while driving, a rule that's becoming common on military bases under a Pentagon directive.
The base began stopping cars and giving verbal warnings Feb 27.
After a 60 day grace period, military personnel, government employees and civilian visitors could be banned from driving on Lackland for up to a year if they're cited for violating the rule four times over the course of 12 months.
The same penalty would apply if they are caught six times in two years, said Master Sgt. Aaron Thieken.
"Right now, we are pulling people over," often to find they aren't aware of the rule, he said.
Unlike a cell phone ban initiated in October at Fort Sam Houston, an Army post, the new rule at Lackland permits the use of hands free cell phone devices with a single earpiece.
Randolph Air Force Base also is studying a cell phone restriction.
Brooks City Base, on city owned land, is not considering one, a base spokesman said.
The Defense Department approved restrictions on cell phone use for motorists last year, leaving the military services and individual bases to decide when and how to enforce the rules.
The restrictions followed a study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that found cell phone use was a growing cause of accidents.
At Fort Sam Houston, 56 citations have been given over the past four months, post spokesman Phil Reidinger said.
Though the post commander could ban a repeat violator from driving there, no one has yet lost driving privileges.
Supervisors and commanders are notified when government or military personnel are cited.
Reidinger said the rule has generally been well received even though it bars motorists from using cell phones altogether while driving.
Hands free devices don't fully prevent accidents, because they allow motorists to have a conversation when they should focus on driving, he said.
"All you have to do is pull over" to talk on a cell phone, he added.
"That's what I do."
(E mail: shuddleston(a)express news.net)
A new mother OK, she's my daughter, but that is not the point of this tale watched disbelievingly the other day as a New York cabby drove away with her baby boy.
How's that for a parent's nightmare?
Here's what happened: Mom hailed the taxi, with 4 month old Max in his stroller, one of those models with an upper part that lifts up and doubles as a car seat.
Mom, first name Maggie, went through her usual taxi routine of buckling Max in, car seat and all, and putting the frame of the stroller in the trunk.
On reaching her destination, she paid the driver.
Then she got out to retrieve the stroller frame.
As a precaution, to signal that she wasn't finished, she left her door open.
The cabby popped the trunk.
She took out the frame.
So far, so good.
That's when the driver took off with (1) his rear right door open, and, more important, (2) the baby still in the back seat.
Maggie, yelling "Hey!" gave chase.
She caught up with the cab after half a block.
The driver stopped.
He said "I'm sorry" when informed that Max was in the car, but did not seem especially contrite.
And that was that.
Mom, her heart pounding, went on her way with the baby.
Oh, did I mention that the driver was yakking away on his cell phone?
His mind was everywhere except where it was supposed to be: on his work.
A shocking story?
Perhaps.
But New Yorkers who take taxis even semiregularly will not be surprised.
They are all too familiar with drivers who hurtle through the streets while talking into the microphone of a hidden cellphone, usually in a language incomprehensible to the passenger.
Indeed, the passenger may as well not exist.
This is not an exercise in cabby bashing.
Drivers work hard.
Despite the moaning about them that you hear from some New Yorkers, they usually know their way around, at least in Manhattan, and they sometimes endure more abuse than they deserve.
(Remember when the Giuliani administration, ever graceful, called them "taxi terrorists" for daring to protest city policies they considered unfair?)
But there is a good reason cabbies are forbidden to talk on cell phones, even with hands free devices, while they are in motion.
They can become so distracted that they miss a turn or fail to stop.
When one of them drives away with a door open and a baby in the back, you know there is a problem.
Even the drivers' union, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, does not defend such behavior.
It may complain that fines imposed by the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission are too high.
But "of course, from a safety angle, we're not for cell phone use while driving," said William Lindauer, a member of the alliance's organizing committee.
Matthew W. Daus, the taxi commissioner, calls the cell phone problem "a challenging enforcement issue" because it is not easy for an inspector standing on the street to tell if a driver is on a hands free phone.
Daus' sense is that the situation has improved of late.
The number of cell phone related summonses issued in 2005 was well below the 2004 total, a fact that he attributed to better compliance, not laxer enforcement.
"But we don't have our heads in the sand," he said.
"We know it's still happening out there."
That it is.
On one level, it is hard not to sympathize with the drivers.
Theirs is a lonely job.
With this technology they can ease their isolation.
But at what cost?
And might they not be a bit less lonely if they just tried talking to their passengers, who always have the right to say they would rather ride in silence?
Both parties, drivers as well as passengers, "often feel like the other one's not treating them as a person," said Bruce Schaller, a transportation consultant specializing in the taxi industry.
From the cabby's perspective, chatting up the passenger could be a good thing, leading to a bigger tip, he said.
But it could also be risky.
"You can get into an argument, or offend somebody," Schaller said.
"There are language issues.
It tends to encourage being pretty passive."
Fair enough.
That being the case, I had a suggestion for Max's mom.
Next time, make paying the driver the last thing you do.
He may forget an open door.
He may forget the baby.
But forget the cash?
Not a chance.
(One in a series of editorials about America's car culture.)
BICYCLISTS SAY THESE motorists are indistinguishable from drunk drivers.
Truckers honk when they stray from their lanes.
Regular drivers watch for their last minute swerves down a side street or onto an exit ramp.
They it will come as no surprise are drivers using cellphones.
Everyone has personal stories of accidents or near misses, but studies are now coming in that make it clear: Cellphone use by drivers in motion is a menace, and a growing one.
Motorists using cellphones are four times as likely to be in an accident as those who aren't, according to a study last year in Australia.
A Harvard study estimates that 6 percent of US accidents, and 2600 deaths a year, are linked to cellphones.
Even so, the number of drivers using a cellphone at any given time rose from 5 to 6 percent nationally between 2004 and 2005, according to a report last month from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Among drivers 16 to 24 years old, frighteningly, it was up to 10 percent.
It is time for Massachusetts to put a stop to the practice.
It is not a matter of personal freedom when distracted drivers endanger others' lives and limbs, or even when they bang a few thousand fenders, driving up everyone's insurance premiums.
Last year, Connecticut and the city of Chicago joined New York state, New Jersey, and Washington, D.C., in banning the use of hand held phones by motorists.
Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, and Tennessee barred their use by young drivers.
But the United States is only catching up with global trends.
Some 40 countries, including most of Europe, restrict cellphone use by drivers.
A bill has been filed in Massachusetts that would outlaw only the use of hand held phones, and another that would apply only to young drivers.
But it has been shown that hands free phones are just as hazardous.
And mature drivers who are not paying attention can be as dangerous as young ones.
Representative James Marzilli, an Arlington Democrat who is pushing for an outright ban of all devices, says he fears that the lack of restrictions has given drivers a sense that the use of cellphones "is a birthright like cars themselves."
But that must change.
Increasingly, Americans are making multitasking a way of life.
But when one of those tasks is piloting a ton of steel, or more, at 100 feet per second, public safety requires a focus on that task alone.
Cellphones are great for emergencies, a driver can pull over and dial 911.
But their use should be banned for motorists while in motion.
They have proven to be a dangerous distraction.
Far too often, 911 is being called because someone was on a cellphone.
New drivers are dialing for danger By BRAD COOPER The Kansas City Star The sky was clear.
The pavement was dry.
Traffic was routine for a weekday afternoon.
As the 17 year old driver exited U.S. 69 in Overland Park, he rolled his pickup as he tried to grab a ringing cell phone from the passenger side floorboard, police said.
He was not badly hurt.
"There was no reason for him to go off (the ramp) other than he just took it too fast, and that was because he was distracted by the cell phone," said Eric Houston, the Overland Park police officer who investigated the crash last summer.
Cell phones and teens are becoming an increasingly dangerous combination on the highway, traffic safety advocates say.
Teens already account for a disproportionate share of traffic fatalities, and wireless phones exacerbate the problem, they say.
Eleven states and the District of Columbia have put limits on teens using cell phones while they drive.
At least 11 other states have considered such laws, including Michigan, which is poised to ban cell phone use by drivers younger than 18.
There are no such limits in Kansas and Missouri.
Now the National Transportation Safety Board is urging other states to pass similar laws for teens learning to drive.
"We know that when you're learning a skill, you should not be distracted while you are doing it," said Mark Rosenker, acting chairman of the safety board.
"Anything that takes away from the total focus of learning how to drive is a distraction," he said.
Some teens recognize the risk, but others discount the danger that cell phones might pose.
They also do not understand why young people should be singled out when wireless phones are as much of a distraction to adults.
"I don't really think it distracts me," T.C. Alex, a 15 year old from Olathe, said.
"I pay extra attention when I'm talking on the phone.
I'm looking out my mirror and that kind of thing," he said.
He was among a group of teens enrolled in a driver's education class at Olathe South School who recently shared their views about driving and talking on cell phones.
Fifteen year old Callie Wheeler said she sometimes answered the phone while she was driving but talked only briefly.
She said she understood the gravity of driving.
"I don't want to get into a wreck," she said.
"I get distracted enough by the radio."
She said she thought it made sense to restrict phones for inexperienced drivers.
But lawmakers who lead transportation committees in Missouri and Kansas said they did not think cell phone restrictions for teens would advance in their states.
They said their legislatures appeared to be in no mood to place new curbs on personal freedoms.
The recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board comes at a time when people of all ages are using cell phones more frequently while on the road.
A federal study found that last year 8 percent of all U.S. motorists, or about 1.2 million drivers, used cell phones while operating their vehicles at any given time.
The study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported that the percentage of drivers between the ages of 16 and 24 who talked on handheld cell phones increased from 3 percent in 2002 to 8 percent last year.
At the same time, cell phones increasingly contribute to crashes in Kansas and Missouri among drivers younger than 21.
In that age group, cell phone related crashes rose 12 percent last year in Missouri and 38 percent in Kansas.
"The biggest concern for young drivers is their lack of experience," said Lt. John Eickhorn of the Kansas Highway Patrol.
"When you add something to the mix on top of their inexperience, it only equates to more crashes with injuries and fatalities."
Last year Kansas recorded 260 crashes in which a cell phone was a contributing factor.
About a third involved a dr iver who was younger than 21.
In Missouri, about 31 percent of the 1246 cell phone related crashes in 2004 involved a driver younger than 21.
Authorities said they doubted that statistics fully measured the problem, because most drivers did not readily admit they were talking on a cell phone before a crash.
But police reports are laced with examples of how teens wreck when they turn their attentions to cell phones.
Consider these: An 18 year old man struck a car driven by a pregnant woman as he reached to grab a cell phone from his back pants pocket.
The woman, who was 26 weeks pregnant, complained of back and neck pain after the September 2004 crash in Overland Park.
A 15 year old girl, driving without her permit at 1 a.m., struck a parked Jeep when she reached to the passenger seat to answer a phone.
No one was hurt in the July 2004 crash in Overland Park.
As she talked on her cell phone, a 17 year old girl drove over a curb and through a field before striking a tree last May in Overland Park.
The girl said she panicked, hitting the gas pedal instead of the brakes.
No injuries were reported.
Fifteen year old Kaitlyn Tompkins, for one, is nervous about doing anything besides focusing on the road.
"I don't feel very safe driving right now, because I'm a beginning driver," she said.
"I'd rather have all my concentration so I don't hit someone."
Still, she has a problem with a government ban.
"It's just like speeding," she said.
"People are going to do it."
Some traffic safety experts say the safety board's proposal is well intentioned, but they question its effectiveness.
"Enforcement is a big problem," said Russ Rader, a spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research organization that is funded by auto insurers.
"It's difficult for officers to readily ascertain the age of the driver, and it's difficult to determine if the driver is using a hands free phone."
The wireless phone industry supports efforts to improve highway safety but believes they should focus on all potential distractions.
"If you single one possible distraction out, you could be doing a disservice by creating a false sense of security that you've taken care of the potential problem," said John Walls, spokesman for CTIA the Wireless Association.
"Young drivers face a lot of potential distractions, from playing their music too loudly to other kids in the car to talking on a cell phone to eating.
The list goes on and on."
Capt. Chris Ricks of the Missouri Highway Patrol said education, not necessarily more laws, is the answer.
He said young drivers must recognize that the distraction is just the start of what can go wrong.
"They don't know how to handle it once they get to a problem," Ricks said.
Brian McKearney, 15, said he was aware of the risk.
"When you're talking, you focus more on the conversation than the road," he said.
"There's really no need to talk and drive.
If it can wait, let it wait."
Drivers caught using hand held phones on the road will be fined under a new law aimed at reducing auto accidents in the U.S. Virgin Islands, officials said Monday.
A first and second offense will carry a fine of between US$25 US$100 (euro21 euro85), while those guilty of a third offense could lose their driver's license for up to a year, police spokesman Sgt. Thomas Hannah said.
The U.S. Caribbean territory of 110000 residents is the only part of the U.S. where people drive on the left, a colonial relic from when the territory was owned by Denmark.
The law takes effect Jan 2.
"We've talked to (paramedics) who've said there have been so many accidents from people on cell phones yapping away," said Sen Roosevelt David, the law's author, who acknowledged almost hitting another car while using his mobile phone behind the wheel.
The law allows the use of hands free mobile phone devices while driving and hand held phones during emergencies.
Last year U.S. District Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow spent weeks under federal protection after a white supremacist in her court threatened to have her killed.
But when the suspect was behind bars, Lefkow felt safe enough to drop the security detail provided her by the U.S. Marshals Service.
Monday night Lefkow returned from work to discover the bodies of her husband and her elderly mother in the basement of her home on Chicago's north side.
Both had been shot.
Tuesday, as marshals were again providing Lefkow with around the clock protection, and dozens of detectives and FBI agents began searching for a motive and suspect in the murders, speculation centered on the followers of Matthew Hale, convicted last year of obstruction of justice and ordering Lefkow's killing.
Lefkow had enraged Hale and his supporters when she ordered Hale's group to change its name after it lost a trademark infringement suit to an Oregon church with a similar name, and later held Hale in contempt and fined him $200000.
More than once since then, someone posted the judge's address on the Web and pasted in a biography and photograph of her husband Michael Lefkow, a 64 year old lawyer.
Careful not to push the evidence too far too fast, a police supervisor said Tuesday that investigators are looking in "many, many directions."
"The case is too new.
The evidence is still being worked up," said James Molloy, chief of detectives.
He said police found much to study at the crime scene near Chicago's lakefront.
Molloy said the killing took place sometime between 10:30 a.m., when Lefkow's mother, Donna Grace Humphrey, 89, took a call from one of her granddaughters, and about 5:30 p.m., when Lefkow returned home.
At 4 p.m., one of the Lefkows' four daughters hurriedly entered the house to grab a gym bag, but did not see her father or grandmother before she left for a workout.
At the federal courthouse, where Joan Lefkow had worked since her 2000 appointment to the bench by President Bill Clinton, disbelief defined the day.
"She is one of the loveliest, most principled human beings who has ever walked the face of this earth," said one friend, who described the Lefkows, married in 1975, as "caring and compassionate people.
They are family oriented people, very religious people, but not in a judgmental way."
Because of the notoriety of the Hale assassination plot, few seemed to believe the killings could be a coincidence.
In the upscale, tree lined Edgewater neighborhood where Lefkow lives, Eddy McDonough said he had seen squad cars parked outside the judge's house in the past.
He considered it a targeted attack.
"This is a hit," McDonough said.
"Most people living here don't feel threatened, since this wasn't aimed at them, but we're in shock."
On average, about 700 threats are made against court officers each year, according to the Marshals Service, which secures federal courthouses across the country.
In 2003, marshals managed special security for 20 federal judges and prosecutors.
If the Chicago killings are eventually connected to Lefkow's work on the bench, it will be the first time that relatives of a federal judge have been murdered.
Three judges have been assassinated.
Mark Potok, chief of the hate group monitoring project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said he believed it was "highly likely that a follower or sympathizer of Matt Hale is responsible.
This is a group with a really remarkable record of criminal violence.
The members of this group have been involved in murder, bank robbery, innumerable beatings and aggravated assaults."
Hale is now being held in a federal prison under rules that severely restrict his contact with outsiders and is scheduled to be sentenced for the murder solicitation conviction April 6th.
He became widely known in 1999 when a supporter named Benjamin Smith went on a racially motivated shooting spree in Illinois and Indiana, killing two people, including former Northwestern University basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong, and wounding nine others.
Hale, who called himself the Pontifex Maximus of his self styled World Church of the Creator, said Smith was a martyr "who gave his life for us."
After Lefkow ordered the group to change its name, Hale said a "state of war" existed between the judge and the organization.
Hale's dispute with Lefkow began with a civil lawsuit filed by an Oregon church with a similar name that feared people would link it to Hale's racist message.
Lefkow sided with Hale, but an appeals court overruled her.
When Hale and his colleagues refused to stop using the name, she ordered them held in contempt.
While the case was working its way through the courts, prosecutors said later, Hale who called Lefkow "corrupt" and a "probable Jew" asked his security chief for Lefkow's home address and tried to persuade him to assassinate her.
The security chief was a federal informant who secretly taped Hale soliciting the judge's murder.
White supremacists viewed Hale as a political prisoner and raised money for his defense.
Slurs against Lefkow and her family were common.
A relatively mild one called her a "sycophantic cow" who did the "Jews' bidding."
At least three times, Potok said, the Lefkows' home address was posted on the Web.
Lefkow refused to pass the trademark case to another judge, writing in 2003 that Hale should not be allowed "to intimidate a judge off the case."
She noted that Hale had said he wanted to "exterminate" her, but said his "is a one sided war in which this court is not embroiled."
Besides, she wrote, she had not seen or heard of "any suspicious conduct by any member of World Church in or around her home, her office or places that her immediate family members frequent."
Hale's conviction in April 2004 brought a sense of relief to the judge and her family.
Michael Lefkow thanked the law officers and friends who had helped the Lefkows and said, "We hope Mr Hale will repent of his advocacy of evil."
Staff writer Christopher Lee contributed to this report, as did special correspondent Kari Lydersen in Chicago, new researcher Madonna Lebling and research editor Lucy Shackelford.
A window shard, spent shell casings and a bloody mop emerged as key pieces of evidence Wednesday in the apparent execution style murders of the husband and mother of a U.S. district court judge in Chicago.
Returning to her home on the city's north side Monday, Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow discovered the bodies of her husband, Michael Lefkow, 64, and mother, Donna Humphrey, 89.
Both victims had been shot to death.
Authorities stressed that federal agents and local detectives had not yet narrowed the scope of their investigation.
But several law enforcement officials and media reports Wednesday indicated that task force members were leaning toward considering it a premeditated crime.
The victims apparently were forced to lie down on the basement floor before they were shot in the head and chest.
"There is nothing spur of the moment or anything that would indicate this was a crime of passion," one official said, adding that the slayings bore the hallmarks of "an execution."
Authorities also found a bloody shoe print and a blood streaked mop, indicating there was an effort to clean up the crime scene, the Chicago Tribune reported.
Chicago police spokesman David Bayless said FBI forensics experts at the bureau's laboratory in Quantico, Va., would analyze ballistics evidence retrieved from the home.
At least two .22 caliber shell casings reportedly were recovered from the Lefkow residence.
Bayless and other officials would not provide specific details about evidence retrieved from the house, out of concern that leaks about the investigation might aid the killer or killers.
"We're going to be vague and general for the time being," he said.
A security detail of federal marshals was guarding Lefkow and other family members at an undisclosed location.
The judge and her husband briefly received protection last year during the trial of a white supremacist who later was convicted of trying to arrange her murder.
The extremist leader, Matthew Hale, is awaiting sentencing next month.
In an interview Wednesday for the Chicago Tribune, Lefkow said she always knew her job put her at risk but never thought it would endanger her family.
"It's so unthinkable," the judge said.
"I imagine my husband must have just walked into something," Lefkow said.
"Both of them were on crutches.
They didn't have a chance."
The judge's husband had recently injured his leg and had surgery.
Two U.S. district judges who work with Lefkow called for officials Wednesday to reassess security arrangements for the nation's federal judiciary.
"This horrible tragedy has got to serve as the basis for a substantial increase in security for judges and their families," U.S. District Judge Wayne R. Andersen said.
"The Internet is plastered with information about every one of us, and I fear and my family certainly fears that these kinds of incidents are going to be repeated unless there is a very high priority on the safety of judges and their families."
U.S. District Judge Marvin E. Aspen also asked for a new look at security measures.
Dan Lehman, a spokesman for the U.S. Northern District of Illinois, said that Andersen had talked to Chief Judge Charles P. Kocoras about his concerns and that some other judges working out of Chicago's downtown federal courthouse had expressed worries since the killings.
"There's real concern that there needs to be a dispassionate, comprehensive look at security arrangements in light of these homicides," Lehman said.
Matthew Hale, the white supremacist convicted last year of plotting to kill a federal judge, sent a statement through his mother on Thursday condemning the murder of the judge's husband and mother as a "heinous crime" that he had nothing to do with.
Hale's mother, Evelyn Hutcheson, said her son also told her, in their weekly 15 minute telephone call, that he was moved to a different cell after the slayings were discovered on Monday and that FBI agents had visited the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago to question him and nearby prisoners.
"There's simply no way that any supporter of mine would commit such a heinous crime," Hutcheson read from the statement, which she said Hale had written before calling his parents.
"I totally condemn it, and I want the perpetrator caught and prosecuted.
"I only hope they seriously want to apprehend the animal instead of railroading the innocent," his statement continued.
"Only an idiot would think I would do this.
My sentencing date is April 6."
Hale, 33, faces up to 40 years in prison for two counts of obstruction of justice and one of soliciting his security chief to assassinate U.S. District Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow.
In 2002, Lefkow had ordered him to pay $200000 for violating an Oregon group's trademark on the name World Church of the Creator.
He is representing himself and is being held under special measures, reserved for terrorists, that restrict his contact with the outside world, allowing only his parents to visit him, each for an hour, every other week.
"He sounded sad, he's worried, frantic, scared so many things," Hutcheson said, adding that Hale has no television but was monitoring news of the killings through radio.
"They've taken him out of his cell where he is working his case.
All of his books and papers have been taken away from him after this."
Lefkow found her husband, Michael F. Lefkow, 64, and her mother, Donna Humphrey, 89, shot to death in their basement when she returned home from work on Monday.
Lefkow had an extra security detail during Hale's trial last year, but it was disbanded after a couple of weeks.
The war of words against U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow lasted two years, a baffling, ominous campaign.
It ended in the conviction of Matthew Hale, a white supremacist who fixated on Lefkow for having thwarted the movement he called his "church."
Now a task force of investigators is trying to learn whether Hale's intimidating words led to murder.
A federal jury last year found Hale, 33, guilty of trying to arrange Lefkow's murder.
After two years of taunts with the judge's personal information and family photographs posted on racist Web sites Lefkow could finally breathe easy.
Hale was isolated in jail, awaiting sentencing.
His communication to the outside world was curtailed and his extremist followers left in disarray.
But in the days since the judge stumbled upon the carnage inside her north side Chicago home, discovering the bullet riddled bodies of her husband, Michael Lefkow, 64, and her mother, Donna Humphrey, 89, Hale's racially obsessed "Creativity" movement again has drawn intense scrutiny.
Investigators have questioned Hale about the war of nerves he once waged and about lingering resentment of Judge Lefkow.
Authorities have pressed his supporters about their communications with the jailed extremist and the possibility of involvement by leaderless "lone wolf" killers.
"They're looking for coded messages," said Kathleen Robertazzo, a Hale intimate who said she was questioned twice this week by FBI agents, who also copied her computer hard drive.
"They said they're looking for any communications between me and any of the members to see if there were plans to do anything," Robertazzo said Friday.
The freelance court reporter said that the agents had seized dozens of letters Hale sent to her from his tightly monitored cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Chicago.
Hale is virtually isolated from the outside world, not allowed contact with other prisoners and barred from any visitors except for his family.
As a result, federal investigators are pursuing the notion that the judge's relatives could have been targeted by white supremacists acting without guidance.
Police also are searching for two men whom they have described as "material witnesses" spotted near the Lefkow home hours before the bodies were found Monday evening.
FBI and Chicago law enforcement officials have declined to speak publicly about any theories.
"Obviously, Matt Hale and his prior conviction is an avenue we have to explore," FBI special agent Robert D. Grant said Friday as he announced a $50000 reward for information in the case.
"We're not going to become myopic," he added.
But if Hale and his coterie of extremists have become the most obvious targets for questioning in the federal manhunt,the origins of their enmity toward Lefkow remain inscrutable.
"It's just so hard to understand," said Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer, a colleague of Lefkow on the federal bench in the Northern District of Illinois.
Hate group experts who have tracked Hale's "Creativity" movement for a decade say that the growth of his World Church of the Creator was a textbook example of a magnetic, racially obsessed activist who surrounded himself with adoring followers and used controversy to gain notoriety in extremist circles.
"On one level, he was pretty smart about it.
He did what most of these extremist leaders do: stir up controversy and bring in people who were dependent on him," said Devin Burghart, a researcher with the Chicago based Center for New Community who has monitored Hale and his faction for the last five years.
But Burghart and others say that Hale's demonization of Lefkow was a perplexing act of self destruction.
"When you go after a federal judge, you're just asking for trouble," Burghart said.
The collision course was set when Hale took over the reins of the World Church of the Creator, a supremacist sect started in 1971 by Ben Klassen.
The former Florida state legislator had forecast a "racial holy war" that would leave Aryans victorious over Jews, blacks and other inferior "mud people."
Hale, the intense son of an East Peoria, Ill., police officer, was chosen in 1996 "Pontifex Maximus" of the racially obsessed "religion" replete with a "White Man's Bible" and Aryan marriage and communion ceremonies.
(Begin optional trim) An accomplished classical violinist and a graduate of Southern Illinois University law school, Hale revived the faction.
Days after Hale was notified that he had failed the Illinois state bar exam in 1999, Benjamin Smith a Hale disciple went on a shooting rampage through Chicago's north shore, aiming at minorities with a .22 caliber pistol.
He killed two people and wounded nine.
Membership in Hale's movement surged in the months afterward, to as many as 88 chapters across the United States.
Hale claimed 30000 followers, although hate group experts said those numbers were inflated.
The group also made inroads with neo Nazi factions in state prisons by distributing white supremacist tracts under the guise of spiritual materials, Burghart said.
(End optional trim) In 2002, a conflict with an Oregon religious group also known as the World Church of the Creator threw Hale's organization into turmoil.
When the Oregon church sued for copyright infringement, the case went before Lefkow.
The judge at first ruled in Hale's favor.
But when she was overruled by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, she ordered Hale's group to change the name it used on the books it sold at rallies and over the Internet.
Hale's followers did not comply, and Lefkow responded by threatening to fine the organization $1000 a day.
Lefkow then was the enemy.
According to testimony in Hale's murder solicitation trial, he told aides that Lefkow's order "places our church in a state of war."
He vowed to "teach this judge a lesson."
Talking to one aide of "intimidation," Hale began planning demonstrations in front of Lefkow's home and at the federal courthouse in downtown Chicago.
And he pressed followers to obtain her address and other personal information including pictures of her husband and four daughters that ended up posted across several extremist Web sites.
"It was a terribly unjust thing for a really wonderful family," said Pallmeyer.
But the judge never complained to colleagues.
"She endured it with dignity," Pallmeyer said.
In January 2003, Hale was arrested by FBI agents and charged with trying to arrange Lefkow's murder.
Hale's security chief had been working with the FBI.
In taped conversations, the informant asked the Pontifex Maximus if "we're gonna exterminate the rat."
Hale replied: "Well, whatever you wanna do, basically."
(Optional add end) Throughout the trial and after Hale's conviction, friends said, the Lefkows who had lived on the same quiet residential street for 20 years clung to familiar routines.
They still took evening strolls to stores and restaurants on Clark Street.
Michael Lefkow, a veteran employment rights lawyer, wore his trademark fedora.
At dinner parties, the Lefkows made light of the surveillance cameras installed outside their home before sitting down and saying grace.
Privately, Michael Lefkow worried.
At his law office one day, he asked attorney Paul Bradley if he could start locking a hallway door that had always been open to the public.
"I told him, 'Only if I can wear a T shirt that said: Not Lefkow,' " Bradley recalled.
"We both laughed about it, but I could tell he was concerned."
Several of Lefkow's fellow judges said they also were frightened.
"Through the entire Matthew Hale trial, we were concerned," said U.S. District Judge Wayne R. Andersen, who since the murders has urged the Justice Department to reassess the security arrangements it provides to judges and their families.
Afterward, the Lefkows found their life easing again.
The precautions taken by U.S. marshals to protect them were scaled back.
The cameras were removed.
A security detail that had patrolled nearby pulled out.
The war of nerves, it seemed, was over.
"You could tell they were relieved," a family friend said.
"Hale was behind bars, and his group was falling apart.
We all thought it was finally over and done with.
Now we don't know what to think."
Bearing down with grand jury subpoenas and teams of interrogators, federal agents and Chicago police sought two men for questioning Thursday in connection with the execution slayings of a federal judge's husband and mother, pressing for information from followers of a white supremacist who insisted from jail that he had no involvement in the murders.
Federal agents seized telephone and computer records from one residence in the Chicago area and interrogated relatives and supporters of Matthew Hale, the leader of an extremist faction known as the World Church of the Creator.
Chicago police also released a sketch of two men wanted for questioning in the crimes and sifted through photographs of Hale's followers in an attempt to identify the pair who reportedly were spotted in a car parked near the judge's home in the hours before the murders.
Held in virtual isolation in a federal detention facility while awaiting sentencing for a 2004 federal conviction for trying to arrange the murder of U.S. District Court Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow, Hale told his mother in a brief telephone call Thursday that none of his followers played any part in Monday's murders of Lefkow's relatives.
"There's simply no way that any supporter of mine would commit such a heinous crime.
I totally condemn it," Hale told his mother, Evelyn Hutcheson, in a 15 minute phone conversation that was monitored and taped by FBI agents.
Hutcheson said Hale told her that the day after the murder he was abruptly moved to a new cell "that didn't have anything in it."
Authorities would only say that they are casting a "wide net" for information from anyone connected with Hale, stopping well short of describing him or any of his supporters as suspects in the case.
But according to sources close to the probe and several people questioned by federal agents, investigators are concentrating on Hale's relatives and a hard core group of supporters in Chicago and his base in East Peoria, Ill. as well as white supremacist sympathizers as far away as northern New Jersey.
"They're shaking the trees for anyone and anything they can possibly find," said a source familiar with the investigation.
"They're clearly heading down the hate group angle."
The source said investigators were in the process of questioning Hale supporters who attended his two week murder solicitation trial last year.
Hale was convicted last April of soliciting his group's "security chief" to kill Judge Lefkow after she enforced a federal appeals court ruling that forced the "creativity" church to change its name.
He is scheduled to be sentenced in April.
Hutcheson said Thursday that a team of federal agents who showed up at her home in East Peoria, Ill., asked her about recent conversations with Kathleen Robertazzo, a supporter of Hale's whose house in the north Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates was searched by federal agents late Wednesday and early Thursday.
According to Hutcheson, agents sought Robertazzo's phone records, searched for firearms and seized the home computer she uses in her work as a freelance court reporter.
Several telephone calls to Robertazzo's home went unanswered, but Hutcheson said Robertazzo told her agents "wanted to know why Kathy and I talk so much.
They think Matt's getting his message out in code."
Under government enforced restrictions designed to severely curtail his communication to the outside world, Hale is isolated from other inmates in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Chicago and can only speak to his parents by telephone briefly every two weeks.
Police gave little background about the sketches they released of two white men one believed to be in his 50s and the other in his 20s who were wanted for questioning.
Authorities would not say if they were witnesses or suspects, but the source said investigators have reviewed photo files of "creativity" supporters, looking for matches.
A worker in a nearby church reportedly noticed the two men sitting in a red Ford Escort idled in a no parking zone near the Lefkow home, several hours before the bodies were discovered.
The church worker told police that he told the men they were parked illegally and they drove off.
(Optional add end) Chicago Police Chief of Detectives Jim Molloy said the killings apparently were committed sometime between 10:30 a.m. Monday, when Donna Humphrey spoke to a granddaughter by phone, and 5:30, when Judge Lefkow found Humphrey and Michael Lefkow lying dead in the basement.
In an interview with the Chicago Sun Times, Judge Lefkow said she could not say whether the murders of her husband and mother "has anything to do with Matt Hale or any of his followers, but I do believe it was a hit not a random thing."
Protected by federal marshals and hidden with her four daughters at an undisclosed location, Lefkow vowed Wednesday to return to the bench.
"Nobody is going to intimidate me off my duty," she said.
In Bergen, N.J., a team of government agents also visited Hal Turner, the host of a white supremacist radio program that airs on short wave frequencies.
Turner said the agents, who work for the Joint Terrorism Task Force in New York, asked him if "I had any idea who did this, why they might go after the judge's family."
Turner said he told the agents only: "I have nothing to say."
The phrase is the standard response that white supremacists encourage their supporters to give to government interrogators.
Turner said Thursday that he had provided air time to Hale before his conviction last year.
According to Adam Schupak, associate director of the Anti Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith in Chicago, Turner suggested in an April 2003 broadcast that Judge Lefkow was "worthy of being killed.
It wouldn't be legal in my opinion, but it wouldn't be wrong."
Turner said Thursday he was not advocating Lefkow's murder.
"If I had the intent to do something bad, I wouldn't broadcast it," Turner said.
A task force of federal agents and Chicago police detectives fanned out Tuesday through a residential neighborhood, searching for clues in the shooting deaths of the husband and mother of a federal judge who had been targeted for murder by a white supremacist group.
Authorities placed U.S. District Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow under around the clock guard after she returned home from work Monday and found the bodies of Michael F. Lefkow, 64, and Donna Humphrey, 89.
The victims apparently were killed in the basement, where investigators reportedly recovered two .22 caliber shell casings.
Jim Molloy, Chicago's chief of detectives, said the slayings occurred between 10:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Autopsies conducted Tuesday by Cook County medical examiners confirmed that the victims died from multiple gunshot wounds.
Officials said some evidence removed from the Lefkow home would be flown to the FBI's forensics laboratory in Quantico, Va., for analysis.
Investigators said they were not ruling out any possibilities, but were taking a hard look at any involvement by domestic extremist groups.
"There's nothing pointing us in that direction," said David Bayless, spokesman for the Chicago Police Department.
"However, we're actively pursuing that."
Police said that deadly home invasions do not fit the community profile in Edgewater, a north side Chicago neighborhood of stylish brick and wood frame houses where the Lefkows lived for nearly 20 years.
The FBI was drawn into the case because killing relatives of a federal judge is classified as a federal crime, punishable either by the death penalty or life imprisonment.
But the statute can only be invoked if the killing was an attempt to impede or retaliate against the judge.
"The crime has to be aimed at affecting a judge's official duties," said Scott Mendeloff, who helped lead a team of federal prosecutors in the conviction of Timothy J. McVeigh for the 1995 Oklahoma City federal building bombing.
A Justice Department official in Washington confirmed Tuesday that FBI agents were "looking at any possible connection related to any case that the judge has handled.
There's a clear history there.
But we haven't excluded any scenarios either."
White supremacist leader Matthew Hale, 33, was found guilty in April 2004 of soliciting someone to murder Judge Lefkow.
He is scheduled to be sentenced next month.
Lefkow, 61, had been singled out by Hale and his followers after she presided over a civil case in which his group World Church of the Creator was sued by a similarly named group for copyright infringement.
Lefkow initially had ruled that Hale could keep the name.
But a federal appeals court reversed her, and in November 2002 she told Hale that she had no choice but to order him to stop using World Church of the Creator on his Web site and in all printed material.
Hale's backers railed against the judge and her family in Internet messages, even posting their photographs and address.
"She and her family were singled out for demonization.
Law enforcement clearly has a lot to look at there," said Devin Burghart, who monitors white supremacist groups for the Center for New Community, a Chicago based activist organization.
Friends of the Lefkows said that the judge and her husband, a veteran labor lawyer, endured monitoring by security cameras and federal undercover teams during Hale's murder solicitation trial.
"They both handled it courageously," said Thomas F. Geraghty, an associate dean at Northwestern University Law School and a close acquaintance.
(Optional add end) At the height of the Hale trial, the Lefkows cheerily ignored the cameras during dinner parties and refused to cut back on nightly strolls through the neighborhood, recalled Michael Miner, a senior editor with the Chicago Reader newspaper.
A U.S. marshal's official said Tuesday that the cameras were removed after only a few weeks with the judge's approval.
Miner recalled Michael Lefkow as an "intense and idealistic" attorney who branched out from a poverty law practice into employment cases and mediation in recent years.
He ran twice for county judge, but was unsuccessful.
Judge Lefkow was a late entrant in the saga of Hale and his World Church of the Creator the extremist group he founded to espouse a doctrine of "racial holy war."
In 1999, Benjamin Smith, a "Creativity" adherent, went on a serial shooting spree on Chicago's north side, killing two people and wounding nine others.
Hale was not linked to those shootings.
But after the judge ordered World Church of the Creator to change its name and imposed $200000 in sanctions, Hale approached one of his aides and urged the judge's murder.
The aide was an FBI informant, and his conversations with Hale were secretly recorded.
Hale's group "is pretty much splintered now," Burghart said.
But he cautioned that white supremacist "lone wolves" were capable of committing violence without direction.

As scores of police officers stood guard, hundreds of mourners filled a church Saturday to bid farewell to a federal judge's slain husband, less than a week after the judge discovered his body in their home, along with that of her mother.
Mourners filed slowly past the casket of attorney Michael Lefkow, his trademark gray fedora resting on top.
They remembered that he would sometimes show up at the federal courthouse to take his wife, U.S. District Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow, to lunch and brought her flowers.
The couple often held hands.
The family has been in protective custody since the judge discovered the bodies on Monday.
FBI officials have said they do not have a suspect.
They have asked for the public's help and offered a $50000 (euro38124) reward to shake loose information.
FBI Agent Robert D. Grant said one avenue of investigation was white supremacist Matthew Hale and his associates.
Hale, 33, faces sentencing next month for soliciting an FBI informant to kill Lefkow after she ruled against him in a trademark lawsuit.
He has denied any involvement in the slayings, which he called "a heinous crime."
Judge Lefkow and the couple's children greeted people arriving at St. Luke's Episcopal Church for a 90 minute service that was conducted under tight security.
Several of the daughters cried, but Lefkow appeared to comfort some mourners.
More than two dozen police and federal marshals were outside the church, and the line to enter stretched down the block.
Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, Chicago Police Superintendent Phil Cline and a number of federal judges were present.
Funeral services for Judge Lefkow's mother, 89 year old Donna Humphrey, were expected to take place in Denver.
A friend of Hale's, Kathleen Robertazzo, told The New York Times and Chicago Tribune in Saturday's editions that authorities seized 100 letters Hale sent her from prison and made copies of her computer hard drive.
Robertazzo told the Times the idea that Hale would be involved "defies logic."
In the letters, she said, Hale describes singing opera in jail, taking Prozac and being buoyed by the presence of a man with the same name as Adolf Hitler's boyhood friend.
Humphrey and Lefkow's 64 year old husband had been shot multiple times, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner's office.
Experts are analyzing several pieces of evidence, including a broken window with a fingerprint, a bloody footprint and cigarette butts.
Investigators released composite sketches Wednesday night of two men seen near the Lefkow home the day of the killings.
CHICAGO The police released composite sketches Wednesday night of two white men they want to question in connection with this week's execution style slayings of a federal judge's mother and husband, in an investigation that has also included interviews with relatives, friends and sympathizers of a white supremacist imprisoned for soliciting the judge's assassination.
The authorities would not say where or when the two men, one in his mid 20s and the other aged 50 to 60, were seen or whether they were suspects or witnesses.
The police refused to discuss whether these men might be connected to the hate groups that have been a prime focus of the investigation.
Evelyn Hutcheson and David Hale, the mother and brother of Matthew Hale, the man convicted last year of plotting the murder of the judge, Joan Humphrey Lefkow, said Wednesday that federal agents had asked them whether Hale might have communicated something from prison in code.
In addition, Hal Turner, a white supremacist radio host in New Jersey who said in 2003 that it would be illegal but not wrong to kill Lefkow said Wednesday that federal agents had also questioned him about his whereabouts during the Monday killings.
Hutcheson, recalled the agents asking Tuesday at her home in East Peoria, Ill., "Does he have a code, did he tell me something in code, which is about the dumbest thing I've ever heard."
She added, "It's obvious they're trying to link Matt to the killings."
David Hale' told the authorities that he came home from his maintenance job at 1:30 p.m. Monday, took a nap, ate dinner and watched a movie with his children, then went to a local convenience store that has a security camera.
"They know where I was and I've been cleared," David Hale said Wednesday.
"They asked if there was an encrypted code, a cryptic message or an encoded thing.
I told my mother not to answer.
They said they were going to leave no stone unturned."
According to a report in Wednesday's issue of The Chicago Sun Times, the authorities are also pursuing telephone calls made to Lefkow's home Sunday night from a correctional facility.
Lefkow, 61, spoke publicly Wednesday for the first time since the slayings, telling The Sun Times that she is "just furious" that the killings might be linked to her job.
"I fear that to be true, and that's the great tragedy of it," Lefkow said, according to an article posted Wednesday evening on The Sun Times Web site.
"If someone was angry at me, they should go after me.
It's not fair to go after my family."
Confined to his cell 23 hours a day, Matthew Hale sings opera loud enough for neighboring inmates to join in.
He is studying Latin and reading everything from the Federal Rules of Procedure to Agatha Christie.
He slid into depression last fall, taking Prozac, but said he was buoyed when the adjacent cell was filled by a man with the same name as Hitler's boyhood friend.
These and other tidbits about Hale, the Aryan leader convicted last year of plotting to kill a federal judge whose mother and husband were slain this week, are in the cache of letters federal agents seized here on Thursday from the home of Kathleen Robertazzo, his frequent correspondent.
Robertazzo, a friend of five years who shares Hale's racial views, said that the authorities took 100 of his letters, written in pencil on yellow legal paper, and made copies of her computer hard drive, promising to search her e mail for secret messages to supporters.
"He doesn't really talk about his case I told him you have to stop, woulda coulda shoulda, it's over," Robertazzo, 53, said in an interview.
"We like to talk about history.
He loves the Roman Empire.
I send him jokes to keep his spirits up, famous one line pickups and stuff and just things to make him laugh.
"We both like classical music," she added.
"He found a Chicago station that has classical music.
He tells me, 'Listen to it at 7:30, and I'll be listening.'
" Hale, 33, has emphatically denied any involvement in the killings, but the pressure on him has risen exponentially this week, as he faces an April 6 sentencing amid mounting sympathy for the judge he was convicted of conspiring to kill.
The FBI offered a reward on Friday of up to $50000 for information in the case, which is to be profiled Saturday on the "America's Most Wanted" television show and has been part of President Bush's morning briefing each day this week.
While the Chicago police said they were investigating 271 tips that poured into a hot line by 5 p.m. Friday including 141 that followed the release of composite sketches of two white men seen near the judge's home Hale and his sympathizers clearly remain a focus of the investigation.
After interviewing her for about 90 minutes on Tuesday, Robertazzo said, federal agents returned to her home in this northwest suburb of Chicago the next night at 8 with state and local police officers and a subpoena.
She said they stayed until 5:30 a.m. Thursday, mainly working on the computer, but also quizzing her about her whereabouts Monday, when Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow of U.S. District Court returned to her Chicago home to find the bodies of her husband and mother.
Robertazzo said agents also asked about her familiarity with the Lefkows' neighborhood and the color of her car.
It is red, like the Ford Escort said to have been spotted at the crime scene, but a Mitsubishi.
"One kept putting his hand on his gun, I felt like such a suspect," Robertazzo said of the agents.
"They asked if I recognized any of those two composites."
When she went to the bathroom and sat for a minute to collect her thoughts, Robertazzo said, an agent asked, " 'How long are you going to be up there?'
It's like they were worried I was going to get a weapon and come out shooting."
Robertazzo, a freelance court reporter, said she first contacted Hale, the self described Pontifex Maximus of the World Church of the Creator, by e mail in 1999, amid public debate over the Illinois bar's decision to reject him even though he had passed the bar exam.
He invited her to meet him at O'Hare International Airport during a four hour layover the next year, and she took him to speak at the public library here in 2001.
Now, Robertazzo sends him postcards with pictures of animals every other day, and they exchange one or two lengthy letters a week.
Though she has been described by those who monitor hate groups as Hale's "middle aged mistress," Robertazzo said their relationship was platonic.
"It was suggested by Matt," she said.
"I told him it would be incest.
We never acted on it."
Robertazzo's comments, and the material she gave the authorities, provide the fullest picture yet of the prison life of Hale, who first encountered Lefkow when she presided over a trademark infringement lawsuit in which an Oregon group tried to block him from using the World Church name.
Lefkow ruled in Hale's favor and dismissed the case.
But her ruling was overturned on appeal, and she later held him in contempt.
The judge was vilified on pro white Web sites, and Hale was soon arrested for plotting her murder with an FBI informant who had infiltrated his group.
"This defies logic that he had any animosity towards Lefkow, she ruled in his favor it's the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals," Robertazzo said, adding that Hale's main complaint these days is about his former lawyer's decisions.
"Judge Lefkow is old news.
If his people were going to target anybody, it would be his attorney.
Matt's venom right now is with the FBI."
Robertazzo said that her own racial views were rooted in her rape, at 13, by a black man.
"I don't want to live with blacks," she said.
"We have safe communities, they move in, and they bring the crime with them."
But, she added, "I don't hate all black people, I don't hate all Jews," and she said that "white supremacy is a misnomer."
"Matt is a separationist, I'm a separationist," she explained.
"White supremacy sounds more ominous.
Supremacy means you want to rule over somebody."
Since his arrest in January 2003, Hale has been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago under special administrative measures that severely restrict his communication with the outside world.
His only permitted visitors are his parents, who get an hour each, every other week.
Many of his supporters have been cut off from contact completely after sending letters with white power symbols, or posting his replies on the Internet, so Robertazzo keeps her correspondence more personal than political.
She sends him famous quotations from George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.
He writes "that the founding fathers would be disappointed in the country we're living in," she said.
Sometimes, she said, she closes with a "message to your enemies: hope your penal implants malfunction," but that typically gets cut out by censors.
The only gifts he is allowed, Robertazzo said, are paperback books.
So she has sent him philosophy by Nietzsche, "The Time Machine" by H.G. Wells, a history of Pearl Harbor, the Agatha Christie mysteries, anything in Latin and, most recently, the 1.7 pound Rules of Procedure.
Robertazzo said that Hale "was starving" when his breakfasts of two hard boiled eggs and two boxes of cereal, and lunch of a tuna salad stuffed green pepper, was cut in half because of budget problems, and that he had been fighting the flu.
She said that, despite his atheism, Hale at one point "prayed to God he wanted to die," and "felt this warm wave of peace go through his body."
Soon after, she said he told her, he found the words "I love Matt Hale" etched in wood paneling at the prison, and someone named Kubizek (like Hitler's boyhood friend August Kubizek), moved into the next cell though the Metropolitan Correctional Center has no record of such a prisoner.
"Matt thought, 'Oh my God, this is all these signs I'm supposed to keep going,"' Robertazzo recalled of his letters.
"He came back from the dead with those three little revelations.
It's amazing."
Robertazzo said she "has nothing to hide."
All the authorities will find on her hard drive, she added, was a "rant and rave about he's being railroaded."
Robertazzo said that she happily provided the letters, since the government already makes photocopies of everything Hale sends, but that she hopes to get back the originals, which she kept in her office, ordered by date, secured by a rubber band.
U.S. District Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow told a newspaper Wednesday she fears the murders of her husband and mother may have been related to her job, saying she is furious over what she called a "cold blooded" attack.
The judge's remarks came as police released sketches of two men seen near the victims' home the day of the slayings, and as two of Lefkow's colleagues called for greater security for federal judges and their families.
"If someone was angry at me, they should go after me.
It's not fair to go after my family," she said in an interview posted on the Web site of the Chicago Sun Times on Wednesday night.
"It was just cold blooded.
Who would do this?
I'm just furious."
Chief of Detectives James Molloy described the two men in the sketches as "persons of interest" whom police want to interview based on witness statements from the neighborhood.
One, a man in his mid 20s, was seen in a car near the Lefkow home.
The other, a man in his 50s, was wearing dark coveralls and a dark knit cap.
Both are white.
Investigators are hoping an abundance of physical evidence left behind in the basement where the killings of Lefkow's husband, Michael, and her 89 year old mother, Donna Humphrey, occurred will point to specific suspects.
"This horrible tragedy has got to serve as the basis for a substantial increase in security for judges and their families," U.S. District Judge Wayne R. Andersen said.
"The Internet is plastered with information about every one of us."
The shootings came a month before white supremacist Matthew Hale was to be sentenced by another judge for soliciting an undercover FBI informant to murder Lefkow, who had ordered Hale to change the name of his extremist group as part of a trademark lawsuit.
Police say extremist groups are just one of several avenues being looked at by authorities, though speculation among judges and lawyers about the killings has focused on Hale's group, which has a history of violence.
Hale's father, retired East Peoria policeman Russell Hale, dismissed the notion that his son was involved in the slayings, saying he is under constant surveillance and the FBI closely monitors his phone calls and visits with family members.
Meanwhile, investigators are hoping that an abundance of physical evidence left behind in the basement where the victims were killed will point to specific suspects.
Both victims had been shot multiple times, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner's office, and a source told the AP that police found two .22 caliber casings at the scene.
Investigators believe the victims were forced to lie on the basement floor before being shot, the Chicago Tribune reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources.
A federal source who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity said a shard of broken glass from a broken window in the Lefkow home contained a fingerprint and was flown to Washington for examination.
The source said police also were analyzing a bloody footprint left at the home.
There are many marshals and other law officers in federal courthouses to provide protection for judges and others.
But judges get no special protection once they leave the courthouse unless a specific threat arises.
Lefkow received special protection for about two weeks after Hale's arrest in 2003, but it was then withdrawn with her concurrence, said Shannon Metzger, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals' office.
Metzger said Wednesday that the office was studying Andersen's comments.
Lefkow and other members of her family have been in seclusion since the killings, guarded by a special protective detail of federal marshals.
But other judges in the courthouse have been coming and going without special security.
U.S. District Judge Marvin E. Aspen also called for more protection.
"I think there is an increased need and awareness because there are people who are interested in attacking the very fabric of our democratic society," Aspen said.
Laura Lefkow, the 20 year old daughter of Joan and Michael Lefkow, said in an e mail to the AP on Wednesday that her father was a true gentleman.
As an attorney, he "worked for the voiceless, those who were unemployed, poor and marginalized," she said.
She remembered her grandmother as a woman "who could do the Sunday crossword puzzle in pen" and hand made quilts for each of her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.
The man authorities have said killed Judge Joan Lefkow's husband and mother also sent hostile, puzzling letters to state and federal officials six years ago, sparking an investigation by the Illinois attorney general's office.
Former state investigators visited Bart Ross' home in the Chicago area suburb of Albany Park in 1999 and began a file on him.
It included notes that Ross sent to then Attorney General James Ryan and other government officials, said Dan Curry, who was Ryan's press secretary.
Some of the notes used inflammatory language and underscored Ross' anger at the government and judicial system.
Others were simply rambling.
Ross, 57, an unemployed electrician, shot himself to death during a traffic stop outside Milwaukee last week.
He was linked by DNA traces and suicide notes to the Lefkow murders.
In September, the judge had dismissed a billion dollar lawsuit Ross had filed alleging that a group of doctors at the University of Illinois Chicago Hospital had disfigured his face and throat during cancer treatments.
After Ross committed suicide, Curry said he received a call from the executive security detail, which guards state officials such as the attorney general, the governor and the secretary of state.
"They told me that they had some contact with (Ross), and that it was threatening to the attorney general and other people," said Curry, who runs a political consulting business in Wheaton.
"They basically considered him as someone to keep an eye on.
There was no direct threat of violence, but there was a lot of inflammatory language and erratic type statements."
Curry did not know which other officials received letters from Ross.
Officials from the executive security detail could not be reached for comment Monday.
Ross also had sent packages of court and other material to various government officials, including Sen Richard J. Durbin, D Ill.
In June, a Durbin spokesman said, Ross walked into the senator's offices in Chicago and dropped off a thick binder filled with files from his court cases.
An unemployed electrician who shot himself to death during a traffic stop outside Milwaukee was linked Thursday by DNA traces and suicide notes to the murders of a federal judge's relatives.
Chicago police superintendent Philip J. Cline said Bart Allan Ross claimed to have targeted U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow after she ruled against him in a lawsuit over his cancer treatment.
On Feb 28, Lefkow's husband and mother were shot to death in their north side Chicago home.
Late Thursday night, police spokesman Matthew Jackson said that Illinois State Police forensics examiners had linked genetic material found on a cigarette butt at the Lefkow crime scene to Ross' DNA.
"We're satisfied that there is information ,that points to his having been in the Lefkows' house" the day of the murders, Cline said.
For the past week, law enforcement officials had been looking into whether the slayings were the work of white supremacists angry over another Lefkow ruling.
But police and federal authorities said details in the letters linked Ross to the murders.
According to reports in Chicago newspapers, investigators recovered a box of several hundred .22 caliber shells similar to spent casings found in the Lefkow house.
The shells and the suicide weapon were being analyzed by forensics experts, Cline said.
Ross, 57, killed himself inside his minivan Wednesday night in West Allis, Wis., as a policeman approached after observing Ross driving erratically near a school.
"When you read this, I should be dead, so I am writing in the past tense," Ross said in one passage of a rambling note that arrived Thursday in the mail at an NBC television affiliate in Chicago.
"I was on my way to Justice."
In debt to creditors, threatened with eviction and armed with several handguns, Ross wrote that he had been on the road in recent weeks, living out of his weather beaten Plymouth minivan and plotting vengeance.
"When I got numb enough to care about nothing, I finally did it," he wrote.
Last fall, Lefkow had dismissed Ross' billion dollar lawsuit, which alleged that a group of doctors had marred his face and throat during radiation treatments for cancer.
According to West Allis Police Chief Dean Puschnig, a town officer saw Ross "writing something down in his vehicle" moments before he heard a gun blast.
"I thought for sure he was coming out of the van at me," said Police Office Ricky Orlowski Jr. Ross shot himself in the head.
Inside the van, investigators found "some material that led us to believe this man might have a connection to the Lefkow homicide," Puschnig said.
According to media reports, the evidence included munitions and a suicide note similar to the one received at the TV affiliate.
The documents also reportedly included a hit list of other judges who had angered Ross, including five members of the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals who had upheld Lefkow's ruling.
In his hand scrawled letter to the NBC station, Ross said he broke into the Lefkow home and hid in a utility room, waiting for the judge with a ".22 with a noise reducer relatively quiet and effective."
Ross wrote that he shot the judge's husband, Michael Lefkow, 64, and mother, Donna Humphrey, 89, when they discovered his hiding place.
Then, he fled.
"I regret killing husband and mother of Judge Lefkow as much as I regret that I have to die for the simple reason that they personally did to me no wrong," Ross wrote in the note to WMAQ.
The note described Ross breaking into the Lefkow home at 4:30 a.m. and hiding in a utility room.
His plan was to "spend all day there and in the evening, 'to get' Judge Lefkow and then others, whoever I could get."
But when Michael Lefkow found him in the utility room about 9 a.m., "I had no choice but to shoot him," Ross wrote.
"Then I heard a voice, 'Michael, Michael,' so I looked to the hallway and saw an older woman."
It was Humphrey.
"I had to shoot her, too.
I followed with a second shot to the head in both cases to minimize their suffering," Ross wrote.
After he fled, Ross said, he later stalked the homes of another judge and one of the doctors he sued.
During a news conference Thursday at Chicago police headquarters, officials said there was no evidence suggesting Ross had accomplices or any ties to the white supremacist group that had been the focus of the murder investigation in recent days.
The group's leader, Matthew Hale, was convicted last year of soliciting Judge Lefkow's murder, he is due to be sentenced next month.
In a 2002 trademark infringement case, Lefkow had ordered Hale and his group to stop using the name World Church of the Creator on his website and in printed material.
After a campaign of intimidation in which the judge's personal information and family photographs were posted on racist Web sites Hale, 33, was convicted of soliciting her murder.
Police and FBI agents questioned Hale, his relatives and supporters about the Lefkow murders.
As federal agents, Chicago detectives and forensic experts in blue antiseptic suits rummaged through Ross' north side home Thursday, Cline and other members of the Lefkow task force said they were not ready to identify him as the presumed killer.
"This case is by no means closed," said Cline.
But the disclosure late Thursday of the DNA link left only ballistics tests on Ross' gun and bullets to be completed.
Cline also said Ross appears to be the older man whose face was released on a composite police sketch last week.
Simon reported from Chicago and Braun from Washington.
Times researchers John Beckham, Lianne Hart and Nona Yates contributed to this report.
Rambling and threatening letters from the man believed to be the killer of a federal judge's husband and mother prompted the Illinois Attorney General's office to investigate him six years ago, former state officials say.
Investigators went to the Chicago home of Bart Ross in the winter of 1999 and created an extensive file on him, noting his paranoia and anger at the government and judiciary, said a former investigator and the office's one time chief of investigations.
Ross, 57, an unemployed electrician, committed suicide Wednesday in a Milwaukee suburb after a police officer pulled him over because of broken taillights on his van.
After Ross killed himself, authorities found a note implicating himself in the murders of Michael Lefkow, 64, and Donna Humphrey, 89.
They were the husband and mother of Judge Joan Lefkow.
"It pains me to think we had this guy in front of us six years ago with no idea what evil he was destined to do," said Kerry Polizzi, a former investigator for the attorney general's office.
Daniel Callahan, a former chief of investigations for the office, said that although he knew of the threats Ross made, it is difficult to fault the actions of the investigators at the time.
"There was nothing in the correspondence that led us to believe there was going to be violence," Callahan said.
Polizzi said the attorney general's office receives as many as 100 alarm raising letters each year.
Ross had been treated for cancer at the University of Illinois Chicago Hospital from 1992 to 1995 and spent more than a decade attempting to receive damages for what he said was medical malpractice that had disfigured his face.
Lefkow, a federal judge, had dismissed the most recent of his repeated lawsuits last year.
Ross "was concerned about government conspiracies, his civil rights, and even accused the hospital of putting a transmitter in his mouth," Polizzi said.
He wrote sometimes incoherent letters to officials at various levels of government.
"There was a file on this, and they received threats from him before," said Dan Curry, who had been press secretary to then Attorney General James Ryan at the time of the 1999 investigation.
Curry said he couldn't recall which other public officials received direct threats.
A man who shot himself to death during a traffic stop in Wisconsin claimed in a suicide note that he killed a federal judge's husband and mother in Chicago, a source close to the investigation told The Associated Press Thursday.
Police Chief Phil Cline said Thursday that two letters and a witness description appear to connect Bart Ross to the killing, but he stopped short of calling the 57 year old Chicago man the sole suspect.
Cline said authorities believe Ross was the man a witness had described seeing near U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow's home the day of the killings.
"We're satisfied that there's information in the letter that would point us to Ross being in Lefkow's house," Cline said.
The suicide note was found in Ross' van after he shot himself just outside Milwaukee, the source told the AP on condition of .
Authorities don't know why he was in the area, about 150 kilometers (100 miles) away from Chicago.
WMAQ TV in Chicago said it also received a hand written note Thursday signed by a Bart Ross, in which the writer describes breaking into the house of Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow around dawn on Feb 28 with the intent to kill her, the station reported.
Lefkow had ruled against Ross in a civil case involving a medical malpractice lawsuit, a ruling that was upheld by a federal appeals court in January.
Ross was also being evicted from his home and had a court date Thursday.
Cline cautioned that authorities were still searching Ross' Chicago home and comparing crime evidence to him.
"We are not prepared at this time to definitely say that any one person in responsible for these homicides," he said.
Lefkow, 61, found the bodies of her husband, attorney Michael Lefkow, 64, and her mother, Donna Humphrey, 89, on the basement floor of the Lefkow home the evening of Feb 28.
Suspicion immediately turned to white supremacist Matthew Hale, who had been convicted of soliciting Lefkow's murder after she ruled against him in a trademark dispute.
Investigators insisted, however, that Hale's followers and other hate groups were just one focus of the investigation.
James Finch, head of the Milwaukee FBI office, said Thursday that agents were not yet scaling back the investigation into the slayings because "we have not definitively tied this individual to the Lefkow murders."
In the letter to WMAQ, Ross said he waited all day in a utility room in the basement and shot the judge's husband after being discovered.
Ross said he then shot Lefkow's mother after she heard the gunshot and called out to her son in law.
"After I shot husband and mother of Judge Lefkow, I had a lot of time to think about life and death.
Killing is no fun, even though I knew I was already dead," the station quoted the letter as saying.
The suicide note found in the van indicated that Lefkow had ruled against Ross in a civil case, costing him "his house, his job and family," the Chicago Tribune reported, citing unidentified sources.
The note also included details in the slayings that were not released to the public, Tribune Deputy Managing Editor James Warren said in an interview on CNN.
Ross was stopped by police in West Allis, Wisconsin, Wednesday evening because his van had a faulty tail light, police said.
As officers approached the car, he killed himself with a gunshot to the head, police said.
An out of work electrician whose delusional, decade long legal crusade against doctors, lawyers and the government was dismissed last year by a federal judge killed himself Wednesday night, leaving behind letters in which he admitted murdering the judge's husband and mother here last week.
Bart A. Ross, 57, had sued the federal government and a raft of others for $1 billion, saying they persecuted him with "Nazi style" and terrorist tactics as he pursued a medical malpractice claim stemming from the severe disfigurement of his cancerous jaw.
He left a suicide note in the van where he had been living, confessing to the crime, and, in a letter to a local television station, said he had planned to assassinate the judge, Joan Humphrey Lefkow of U.S. District Court, but "had no choice but to shoot" her loved ones when they discovered him hiding in the basement.
Along with the confessional suicide note, the police said they found some 300 .22 caliber bullets, the same caliber used in the execution style slayings, in the Plymouth van where Ross, who had no criminal record, shot himself in the head after being stopped in a Milwaukee suburb for a missing taillight.
Though the authorities said they would not consider the case closed until they could tie Ross, through fingerprints and DNA, to physical evidence left at the scene, his death and admissions were a shocking turn in a vast investigation that had thus far focused on white supremacists.
Chicago Police Superintendent Philip J. Cline said Thursday that Ross' name was on a list of people, culled from Lefkow's caseload, that investigators planned to interview.
He also said Ross resembled one of two composite sketches released two days after the deaths, and that his account of leaving the Lefkows' home at 1:15 p.m. on Feb 28 matched witness reports.
Lefkow, who expressed "sincere empathy" for Ross in legal papers even as she said his claims "lack any possible merit," described him in an interview early Thursday as "a very pathetic, tragic person" and said the news was "very chilling."
"I guess on one level I'm relieved that it didn't have anything to do with the white supremacy movement, because I feel my children are going to be safer," Lefkow said as she departed for Denver to bury her mother, Donna Humphrey.
"It's heartbreaking that my husband and mother had to die over something like this."
The man believed to have killed a federal judge's husband and mother typed out a suicide letter two weeks before the shootings and included a hit list of judges, lawyers and doctors, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
Bart Ross, 57, an unemployed electrician, committed suicide March 9 in his van in a Milwaukee suburb.
In the van, police and federal agents found the letter in which he implicated himself in the Feb 28 murders of Michael Lefkow, 64, the husband of U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow, and the judge's mother, Donna Humphrey, 89.
"When you read this I should be dead, so I am writing in past tense," he wrote in the four page letter obtained by the Chicago Tribune.
The typed letter, dated Feb 13, was found along with a handwritten account of the Lefkow killings, the newspaper said.
The account detailed how he was hiding in the Lefkows' basement when Michael Lefkow discovered him and how he killed both victims.
He expressed regret for killing Lefkow and Humphrey because "they personally did to me no wrong," he wrote.
The letter declared Ross a victim of medical malpractice and contained a hit list of seven federal judges, four state judges, 10 lawyers and five doctors, according to the newspaper.
Ross, a heavy smoker, was treated for cancer of the mouth from 1992 to 1995.
Surgery and radiation saved his life but disfigured his face, and Ross set out through the court system trying to make his doctors pay for what they'd done.
Lefkow had dismissed the most recent of his repeated lawsuits last year.
"I was left with no possibility to live my life, but to progressively suffer more and more, so like those who jumped down from the WTC Towers on September 11, 2001, I 'jumped' too.
On the way, I intended to send to Hell as many of the listed (expletive) as I was lucky to get," Ross wrote, according to the Tribune.
"I am not a murderer," he wrote in the letter.
"The murderers are the listed (expletive), who violated me like Nazis and terrorists and deprived me justice and compensation to put my life in order, and in this way deprived me possibility of salvaging my life."
Nine days after the Lefkows were killed, a police officer in West Allis, Wis. stopped the van Ross was driving because a taillight was broken, and Ross shot himself in the head.
Hours earlier, a parking ticket was issued for his minivan about four blocks from a federal courthouse in Milwaukee where two federal judges who upheld dismissals of Ross' lawsuits have offices.
One of the judges was on Ross' hit list, the Tribune reported.
Ross ended his suicide letter saying he wanted to cause pain to everyone on his list.
"I regret that I cannot torture this (expletive) the way they tortured me for over 12 1/2 years and I regret that I cannot at least send them all to Hell," he wrote.
The investigation into the execution style slaying of a Chicago federal judges husband and mother took a surprising turn Thursday when police said that a man who killed himself during a traffic stop was now a prime suspect.
Suspicion had earlier been focused on a neo Nazi and white supremacist group whose leader had previously threatened the 61 year old judge.
Police have identified the suspect as Bart Ross, a loner with no apparent links to the white supremacist group.
Attorney Michael Lefkow, 64, and Donna Grace Humphrey, 89, were discovered by district court judge Joan Lefkow in her suburban Edgewater home after she returned from work on February 28.
Both had been shot in the head in the basement of the house.
Earlier on Thursday, a local television station received a rambling, handwritten note signed Bart A. Ross in which the writer confessed to killing Lefkow and Humphrey.
It arrived in the newsroom after a man identified as Bart Ross shot himself when his brown minivan was pulled over Wednesday in a Milwaukee suburb about 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of where the slaying took place.
Chicago police said a note was discovered in the vehicle in which Ross implicated himself in the murder.
In the letter addressed to the television station, the writer said that he broke into the Lefkow home because he wanted "to get Judge Lefkow and them others, whoever I could get."
According to the authorities, Judge Lefkow had dismissed a medical malpractice suit filed by Ross a number of years ago.
After he was discovered in his hiding spot in the utility room, the author of the letter said he "had no choice" but to shoot Michael Lefkow in the back of the head.
He then went on to describe shooting Humphrey after she called out "Michael, Michael" and came looking for her son in law at the sound of the shots.
The author gave several reasons why he wanted to kill the judge.
"Judge Lefkow was No. 1 to kill because she finished me off and deprived me to live my life through outrageous abuse of judicial power and decicration (sic) of the judicial office.
Judge Lefkow, to her neighbors, is a church going 'angel'.
To me, Judge Lefkow is a Nazi style criminal and terrorist," the author wrote.
The writer also mentioned two other people he intended to kill in retribution for the problems hed had with the medical malpractice suit.
Police said they have not yet confirmed that Ross was the killer.
"We understand that there is plenty of information out there pointing to this individual as a possible offender," said Chicago Police Superintendent Philip Cline.
"However, only a complete and total analysis of all the evidence will point us in any one direction."
The killer broke into U.S. District Judge Joan H. Lefkow's house and hid in a utility closet.
Furious that she had rejected his rambling lawsuit, he planned to wait until she came home and then shoot her dead.
But the judge's husband found the man first.
"I had no choice ,but to shoot him," Bart Ross wrote in a suicide note received Thursday by a Chicago television station.
"Then I heard a voice, 'Michael, Michael,' so I looked to the hallway ,and saw an older woman.
I had to shoot her, too.
"I followed with a second shot to the head in both cases to minimize their suffering."
Chicago police announced Thursday that Ross, who killed himself with a single shot to the head in a Milwaukee suburb Wednesday night, is responsible for the Feb 28 killings of Lefkow's husband, Michael, and mother, Dorothy Humphrey, a case that sent shudders through the federal judiciary.
Late Thursday night a Chicago police spokesman confirmed that Ross's DNA matched evidence found in the Lefkows' house.
Police Superintendent Phil Cline told reporters that letters left by the electrician, 57, contained details only the killer would know.
He also said a witness saw someone resembling Ross leaving the North Chicago house on the day of the shootings.
But Cline emphasized that police are not prepared to make a definitive statement about all aspects of the case until the evidence has been analyzed.
"This case is by no means closed," he said.

Chicago police announced Thursday that Ross, who killed himself with a single shot to the head in a Milwaukee suburb Wednesday night, is the principal suspect in the Feb 28 murder of Lefkow's husband and mother, a disturbing case that sent shudders through the federal judiciary.
As the FBI and the Illinois crime lab studied DNA and fingerprints for a match, Chicago police Supt.
Phil Cline told reporters that letters left by the 57 year old electrician contained details only the killer would know.
He also said a witness saw someone resembling Ross leaving the Lefkows' home on the day of the shootings.
But Cline emphasized that police were not prepared to make a definitive statement until the evidence had been analyzed.
"This case is by no means closed," he said.
The sudden development in the case startled investigators, who had focused on the fact that Judge Lefkow had been targeted for assassination by white supremacist Matthew Hale.
Investigators thought it likely that a Hale sympathizer committed the murders and specialists pointed out that Lefkow's address was posted on hate groups' Web sites.
It remains publicly unknown how Ross found Lefkow's home, but investigators said they had found no connection between hate groups and Ross, who blamed his anger on a legal and medical establishment that he said had "violated me Nazi style" for 12 years.
In his writings, Ross named other potential targets, including judges and doctors he felt had done him wrong.
More than one judge and lawyer fearful that Lefkow was targeted by supremacists said the prospect of a disgruntled and murderous litigant is even more worrisome.
Judges in all jurisdictions must deal with aggrieved petitioners whose problems they cannot fix.
"In many respects this is more sobering and more frightening because there are many more people like this man who could have a similar grudge against a judge," said Chicago Bar Association President Joy Cunningham, a former judge.
"Many litigants come to court with expectations the system is not able to deliver."
Ross's gripes began in the mid 1990s, after he had been treated for mouth cancer at the University of Illinois at Chicago hospital.
Disfigured by the treatment, which left him cancer free, according to the hospital, he became convinced that he had been the victim of malpractice.
After a string of state and federal judges had rejected his claims, Ross last year filed a federal lawsuit that was randomly assigned to Lefkow.
His anger came through in documents seeking more than $500 million from the state of Illinois, and millions more from doctors and lawyers.
"Lawyers are telling me to get a doctor and doctors are telling me to get a lawyer," Ross wrote.
He said he drove more than 5000 miles and contacted more than 100 lawyers and 200 medical experts in search of someone who would fight his case with him.
After one lawyer took the case and lost, Ross sued her.
Ross, who was facing an eviction notice, said he lost all his upper teeth during the treatment and needed to have his jaw rebuilt.
The hospital said in a statement Thursday that Ross received "conservative and appropriate care," and that disfigurement is a common result of the treatment.
"He was becoming obsessed with the issue and more and more paranoid," said Don Rose, a Chicago political consultant whose partner hired Ross to do electrical work.
He said Ross asked his help in filing his lawsuits and later asked him for money.
Rose said he recommended several lawyers but did not give him any money.
Investigators studying the murders of Michael Lefkow, 64, and Donna Humphrey, 89, had reached a series of dead ends.
DNA and a fingerprint taken from the Lefkows' home found no matches on federal databases.
Interviews of Hale and his associates turned up nothing substantial.
Cline said Ross's name was on a list of litigants whom FBI agents and detectives had intended to interview.
He said police were working their way through 600 tips and hundreds of cases in Lefkow's court and the business relations of her husband, a labor lawyer.
On Wednesday evening, a patrolman in West Allis, Wis., spotted a man in a brown van on a little used street.
He appeared to be writing something.
When the man made a U turn and drove away, the officer pulled him over for having no tail lights.
As the officer approached, the man who turned out to be Ross shot himself.
Several hours later, police discovered in the car what investigators described as a suicide note linking him to the Lefkow case.
They also found .22 caliber shells consistent with the bullets used in the murder.
The letter to NBC affiliate WMAQ, which Cline described as consistent with the document found with Ross, portrayed Ross as a victim no less than the Lefkows are victims.
Ross wrote in a sometimes illegible scrawl that the people who tormented him killed Michael Lefkow and Humphrey as much as he did.
Ross, who emigrated from Poland and shortened his name, said he intended to hide until he could kill the judge when he broke into the house at 6:30 a.m. on Feb 28.
He waited until about 1:15 p.m. before he gave up.
Lefkow found the bodies about four hours later.
"Judge Lefkow was No. 1 to kill because she finished me off and deprived me to live my life through outrageous use of judicial power and decicration (sic)of the judicial office," Ross wrote to WMAQ.
"Judge Lefkow, to her neighbors, is a church going 'angel.'
To me, Judge Lefkow is a Nazi style criminal and terrorist."

The parents of white supremacist Matthew Hale said Tuesday that their jailhouse visits and phone calls had been suspended indefinitely as the investigation continues into the killing of a federal judge's husband and mother.
Hale was convicted last year of plotting to murder Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow after he lost a trademark infringement case.
He is awaiting sentencing.
Russell Hale and his ex wife, Evelyn Hutcheson, said that they had been preparing for a bimonthly visit with their son when a counselor contacted them late Monday and told them not to come.
"I was so shook up by it all, I didn't have the sense to ask why," Russell Hale said.
Officials with the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago declined comment.
Also Tuesday, the Chicago Tribune reported that DNA found on a cigarette butt inside the Lefkow home where the judge found the bodies does not match any family member or any known criminal profile in the United States.
The deaths of Michael F. Lefkow, 64, and Donna Humphrey, 89, have rocked this city's legal community and raised concerns nationwide about protection for the judiciary.
In 2002, Lefkow presided over an Oregon group's lawsuit against Hale and his racially obsessed movement.
Lefkow initially ruled in Hale's favor, but a federal appeals court reversed her.
So Lefkow ordered Hale to stop using World Church of the Creator on his Web site and in all printed material.
Then came two years of taunts with the judge's personal information and family photographs posted on racist Web sites before Hale, 33, was convicted of soliciting her murder.
Hal Turner, a New Jersey man who hosts a white supremacist shortwave radio program, had posted on his Web site the names and work addresses of three appellate court judges connected to Hale's copyright case.
On Tuesday, he removed the material.
But he left an electronic link to a court ruling that lists their names, along with this statement: "I believe it is time to put the judges named above (in the ruling) into the arena of public scrutiny."
FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III, testifying before the House Appropriations Committee Tuesday, assured lawmakers that the Lefkow case would be solved.
"We will find them.
They will be arrested, and they will do time for this.
We are working 24 hours," Mueller said.
"We will leave no stone unturned, no piece of forensic evidence unanalyzed.
Every lead will be tracked down, and (we) absolutely believe that we will identify the individual, and that person will be arrested and prosecuted."
The task force dedicated to the case is made up of federal marshals, FBI agents and Chicago police detectives.
The investigation led FBI officials to Michael Lefkow's Chicago law offices Tuesday, where they questioned staff about past cases.
Attorney William Spielberger, who shared office space with Michael Lefkow, said FBI investigators picked up some address books last week.
He would not say what they asked him about.
"They're in there right now, interviewing the secretaries," said Spielberger.
"I looked up to him (Lefkow).
He was a mentor in many ways."
Authorities have not publicly described the evidence they are collecting.
But newspaper accounts have said the items taken from the Lefkow home include the cigarette butt, a soda can, .22 caliber shell casings and a bloody shoeprint.
Five members of a Colombian family were killed and another one injured in a deep night attack, which police said on Saturday was conducted by the country's largest rebel group FARC.
The family was attacked Friday night by eight armed men dressed up as civilians in Colombia's Sucre department, local police commander Colonel Carlos Millan said.
Four women, including one with four month pregnancy, and one man were killed in the attack and another one injured on legs, Millan said.
He said Front 35, a rebel group belonging to the FARC, did the attack.
According to press reports, two of the killed women, aged 21 and 26, were girl friends of local police staff.
The FARC, with 20000 combatants, is the country's largest and oldest rebel organization and allegedly finances itself through drug trafficking and kidnappings.
Colombia has been plagued by a four decade civil war, in which leftist rebels, far right paramilitary and government troops fight each other, killing 3500 people every year.
The Colombian Navy has captured a member of the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), who was believed to be involved in the slaughtering of five members of the same family, authorities said Wednesday.
The rebel was identified as Willinton Quiroz, also known as " Juan Carlos," of Front 35 of the FARC.
Quiroz was also wanted for crimes of rebellion and terrorism, said the Navy.
The slaughter occurred last Friday night in the rural area of Coloso in northern Sucre province.
Several armed men broke into houses inhabited by the same family.
Among the victims were the girl friends of a police agent and a soldier.
One victim was pregnant for four months.
The FARC, the largest guerrilla force in Colombia, is accused of committing selective murders and slaughters, as well as terrorist acts in different parts of the South American country.
President Alvaro Uribe said late Thursday he was ready to negotiate a prisoner swap with the country's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
The talks to exchange 59 hostages held by the rebels local politicians, military, police for some 50 jailed FARC members could last up to five days and be held at a foreign embassy or the Vatican's embassy in Bogota, Uribe said in a statement.
The president asked the Swiss government to deliver his proposal to the FARC leadership and repeat to them his August 18 offer to unilaterally release some jailed rebels as a goodwill gesture to be followed by the release of a group of politicians being held hostage.
Uribe reiterated his demand that any rebel released from jail must not have committed "a major crime and that they promise not to return to the guerrilla group either by leaving the country or undergo a program of reintegration (into civilian life in Colombia."
Once the the rebels are released from jail, Uribe added, "the guerrilla must make a gesture to free some of the Colombians it is holding.
"At that moment, we will take the third step, which is to negotiate in an embassy or at the Vatican nunciature in Bogota, for five days, to thrash out the agreement," the president said.
Uribe said he decided to negotiate with the FARC after speaking with hostages' families around the country, who urged him to strike a deal with the rebels.
"I face here a serious dilemma: I feel the intense pain of the victims' families, but also the great responsibility in leading the government and avoiding any agreement that could undermine our national security," the president said.
Government peace commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo later provided more details of Uribe's offer to the FARC.
He said the president offered the initial release of 15 jailed guerrillas in exchange for 15 FARC hostages and that FARC negotiators would be brought to and from their mountain hideouts to Bogota for the negotiations by the International Red Cross and the Roman Catholic Church.
Restrepo also stressed that Uribe's offer did not mean the military's anti guerrilla operations around the country would be suspended.
Uribe's announcement follows the release of a videotape by the FARC three days ago showing that 12 provincial lawmakers it captured in April 2002 were alive.
The hostages in the recordings urged the government to enter in direct negotiations with the FARC.
The politicians are among 59 people held hostage by the FARC, including 22 politicians, 34 military personnel and police officers and three US nationals.
To Uribe's August 18 proposals, the FARC on September 14 responded by demanding that the government demilitarize a vast southern region comprising the townships of San Vicente del Caguan and Cartagena del Chaira.
The government turned down the rebel demand.
Uribe's latest announcement has raised cautious hope among the relatives of the hostages.
Yolanda Pulecio, the mother of Ingrid Betancourt, a former presidential candidate who has French nationality as well as Colombian and who was kidnapped nearly three years ago, said she was "surprised by the president's change in attitude."
"It gives me a lot of hope.
Maybe it will unravel this tough situation we're living through, this waiting for so long.
We were all so desperate because we could see no light, no way out.
I hope God will make it happen," Pulecio said.
The office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on Thursday condemned the killing of five members of the same family in north Colombia last Friday, local press said.
The UN office demanded the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) clarify whether it was responsible for the crime.
It also asked the group to ensure strict compliance of its members with international humanitarian law.
Five members of the same family, four of them women, were murdered last Friday by armed individuals who broke into their house in Coloso in the northern Sucre province.
One of the victims was pregnant for four months.
Two others were girl friends of a soldier and a police agent of the area.
The Sucre authorities blamed FARC guerrillas for the killing, who has not yet claimed responsibility.
The UN office believed the women were murdered because of their relationship with law enforcement officers.
The Colombian authorities on Wednesday captured a FARC member who was suspected of being involved in the Coloso killing.
The FARC, with 17000 members, is the country's largest and oldest rebel organization.
Colombia has been plagued by a four decade civil war, in which leftist rebels, far right paramilitaries and government troops fight each other, killing about 3500 people every year.
Colombia's hardline government said Friday it is willing to meet with members of the country's main leftist rebel group in an unprecedented offer aimed at freeing dozens of rebel hostages, including three Americans.
Before any face to face meeting can take place, however, the rebels must agree to swap 15 hostages for 15 rebels jailed on minor charges, said Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo.
Despite mistrust on both sides, Restrepo said the government is willing to release the 15 jailed rebels first, provided the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, at least expresses a willingness to reciprocate.
"All we're looking for is a minimum sign of hope and we will start the ball rolling," Restrepo told local radio.
After any initial prisoner exchange, the meeting, which could last up to five days, would take place in the Vatican's embassy in Bogota or at another diplomatic mission in the capital, according to the government proposal, which was first announced Thursday night and then amplified Friday.
The FARC had no immediate response.
The proposal calls for a total of 50 jailed rebels to be freed in return for about 60 so called political prisoners the FARC is holding in jungle hideouts.
The FARC's hostages include politicians, police officers, soldiers and three U.S. contractors whose small plane crashed in rebel held territory early last year.
Restrepo said the government would allow the Red Cross to escort to the capital any FARC members taking part in the talks and would return them home when the talks end, accompanied by the Roman Catholic Church representatives.
Augusto Castro, vice president of the Catholic Church's ruling body in Colombia, said he hopes the FARC reacts positively to the offer.
"This proposal addresses the need to find a solution at a time when we are all concerned about being on a street with no exits," said Castro.
The previous administration of President Andres Pastrana held face to face peace talks with the FARC for three years inside a safe haven as large as Switzerland in the jungles and cattle country of southern Colombia.
Those talks collapsed, and the government rescinded the safe haven, in 2002 after the FARC rebels hijacked an airliner and kidnapped a senator who was aboard.
In their last communique, the FARC on Oct 20 said it wanted two new safe havens to be created in southern Colombia in which talks on a prisoner exchange would be held.
The government rejected providing additional safe havens to the rebels.
The FARC and a smaller rebel group have been battling a succession of elected governments in this Andean nation for 40 years.
The United States on Wednesday warned US citizens of a possible spike in "terrorist activity" in Colombia in the coming week as the left wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) mark the one year anniversary of the death of one of their commanders.
The State Department, through the US embassy in Bogota, urged Americans in Colombia to boost their security precautions ahead of the October 19 anniversary of the death of Edgar Gustavo Navarro, believed to have been responsible for the taking of three US hostages in February 2003.
"The embassy wishes to inform American citizens throughout Colombia of the possibility of increased terrorist activity in connection with the upcoming October 19 Anniversary of a FARC leader's death," it said.
"Americans are urged to maintain a heightened level of vigilance and to continue practicing good security measures during this time," it said in a notice to US citizens, a copy of which was provided to AFP in Washington by the State Department.
Navarro, who was killed in combat last year, is thought by Colombian authorities to have been behind the abduction of the three Americans Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes and Keith Stansell after their anti drug flight crashed in a FARC stronghold in the Colombian Amazon.
The trio remain in captivity despite a five million dollar US reward for information leading to their release and an August offer from Colombian President Alvaro Uribe to swap 50 imprisoned rebels for their freedom along with that of 22 politicians and 34 soldiers and police officers held by the FARC.
The FARC with about 17000 fighters and a smaller leftist guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army (ELN) with some 6000 members, have been locked in a 40 year civil war against the Colombian government.
The conflict has claimed more than 200000 lives.
Both groups, along with the right wing paramilitary United Self Defense Force of Colombia (AUC), are designated "foreign terrorist organizations" by the United States and subject to US sanctions.
Uribe has appealed for more international support in his country's war against the rebels.
The United States is a major donor to his efforts, having given Colombia 3.3 billion dollars in aid since 2000.
The United Nations expected the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to consider in a constructive way Colombian President Alvaro Uribe's proposal for the humanitarian exchange, UN special envoy James Lemoyne said on Sunday.
The UN said in a statement that it values the new proposal on humanitarian exchange between the FARC and the government, which is supported by the Catholic Church and the families of the victims.
Last Thursday, Uribe proposed to the FARC that the two sides to negotiate in the Apostolic nuncio's premises, or in an embassy in Bogota, in five days.
However, the Colombian leader rejected a FARC proposal to demilitarize an area to swap hostages for its jailed members.
An eventual humanitarian exchange deal would lead to the release of 22 politicians, 37 members of the military and three US citizens, in exchange for 50 FARC guerrillas in Colombian prisons.
The FARC, the largest and oldest guerrilla organization in Colombia, has at least 17000 men operating in different regions of the country.
Colombia has been plagued by a four decade civil war, in which leftist rebels, far right paramilitaries and government troops fight each other, killing about 3500 people every year.
Suspected rebels detonated a bomb inside the home of peasant family in southwest Colombia early Friday, killing a 19 year old man, police said.
The victim's mother, who was also in the house, escaped unhurt from the attack in the village of Santander de Quilchao, 340 kilometers (210 miles) southwest of Bogota, said police Col Mario Florez.
Florez said he suspects Colombia's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, was behind the attack because the bomb was of the kind the group typically uses.
Florez said there was no apparent motive for the attack.
"It really doesn't make sense at this point.
Why would the FARC bomb the home of this peasant family?" he said.
The FARC and another smaller rebel group have been fighting the government for 40 years in a conflict that claims more than 3000 mostly civilian lives a year.
Police arrested a rebel commando who last year allegedly attacked a Bogota pub, killing one woman and injuring dozens of other people, authorities said Tuesday.
Colombian National Police arrested Adolfo Toledo, who goes by the alias "Dollar," after he produced a fake identification during a traffic stop Monday in the southern Colombian village of Algeciras, police said.
On Nov 15, 2003, rebels dressed in plain clothes tossed hand grenades into two brewpubs the Bogota Beer Company and Palos de Moguer both of which are frequented by American soldiers, contractors and journalists.
U.S. authorities have said the attack aimed at killing Americans.
It was the first time the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, launched an indiscriminate attack against U.S. citizens.
Among the wounded were U.S. contractors supporting Colombia's war against the rebels and an American Airlines pilot.
Gen. Jorge Daniel Castro, chief of the Colombian National Police, said Toledo threw one of the grenades into the patio of the Bogota Beer Company, where most of the casualties occurred.
Toledo has been charged with terrorism, homicide and conspiracy in Colombia, according to President Alvaro Uribe's office.
But Castro indicated he would just as soon see Toledo sent to the United States to be tried and punished.
"How great it would be to see a terrorist like this going to the jails of the United States," Castro said.
Earlier this month, Arturo Montano, 26, was sentenced to 26 years in prison after pleading guilty to tossing hand grenades into the brewpubs.
He was caught by a security guard minutes after the attack in Bogota's Zona Rosa nightclub district.
Toledo and Montano have been identified as members of the FARC's Teofilo Forero Column, an elite unit of the rebel group which has been waging guerrilla warfare in this Andean nation for 40 years.
The arrest came as the FARC said it is prepared to enter into talks with representatives of the Roman Catholic Church to facilitate an exchange of hostages held by the rebels including three U.S. military contractors for imprisoned guerrillas.
"We are prepared to meet with representatives of the Catholic church as many times as is necessary in any place that has (security) guarantees for them as well as us," Raul Reyes, a FARC spokesman, said in a statement broadcast by Noticias Uno television on Monday night.
The Rev. Luis Augusto Castro said the FARC statement is encouraging news, noting that it is the first time the rebels have said they would be willing to meet with church officials outside Colombia.
But Reyes insisted that any meetings with the government take place in two counties in southern Colombia that would be declared demilitarized zones.
Uribe has ruled out creating safe havens for the rebels.
While priests have been in contact with Reyes and other FARC leaders, no formal role has been laid out for them.
The FARC kidnaps hundreds of people a year for ransom, and also holds dozens of so called "exchangeables," including Colombian politicians, police officers, soldiers and the three U.S. contractors.
The FARC says the hostages would be released only when the government releases jailed rebels.
Both sides are far from reaching an agreement and formal talks have not yet begun.
The government insists the freed rebels be sent to another country, or another method be found that would prevent them from rejoining the FARC and kidnapping more people.
The FARC says any freed rebels should be returned to the rebel group.
The leadership of Colombia's main leftist rebel army, the FARC, has ordered its troops to try to kill Presidsent Alvaro Uribe, Defense Minister Jorge Alberto Uribe said late Wednesday.
"There is information from multiple sources indicating that the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) not only have the plan they have had since the president opted to seek office, but also have ordered its units to push hard to try to kill him," the minister told reporters.
"The order is specific and comes from multiple sources, It is an instruction that has come from the FARC leadership.
It would be another attempted strike, let's hope it never goes further than that," the defense chief added.
In June police said they broke up a series of planned attacks during a visit by Uribe to the city of Cali.
The president, when on the campaign trail, narrowly escaped a FARC attempt on his life April 14, 2002 in the port city of Barranquilla when a bomb went off just as his armored car passed.
Alvaro Uribe, who has been president since August 7, 2002, is pursuing an aggressive strategy against armed irregulars with his Patriot Plan, the biggest military offensive in four decades against the Marxist FARC.
With some 17000 troops, the FARC is the largest and longest fighting rebel force in the Americas.
A federal investigation into the alleged kidnapping of a Colombian rebel leader who turned up in the custody of Colombian police last month is under way, Venezuela's interior minister said Tuesday.
Interior Minister Jesse Chacon said authorities were investigating whether Rodrigo Granda, a member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, was kidnapped in Caracas Venezuela's capital and later moved to Cucuta, a Colombian town along the border where he was picked up by Colombian police.
Chacon's comments came three days after the FARC said in a statement that Granda, a foreign relations official for the armed group, had been seized by Colombian intelligence agents in Caracas on Dec 13.
In the statement, which was posted Sunday on a Web site linked to the rebel group, the FARC said Granda was collared in Caracas after taking part in two days of meetings with other leftist organizations that support Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.
The FARC called the arrest a "lamentable precedent" and asked Venezuela's government to "define its position" regarding the ability for members of the FARC and other left leaning groups to enter Venezuela in the future.
Chacon told a press conference that Venezuelan authorities were investigating the kidnapping of an unidentified man in western Caracas on Dec 13, but said it remains unclear whether the victim of the abduction was Granda.
"The investigations still have not shown the identity of the person kidnapped," Chacon said.
Chacon said Venezuelan authorities have not determined whether Granda attended a forum organized by left leaning groups prior to his arrest.
"There was a large number of people who participated in this forum who were not invited, both Venezuelans and those from other Latin American countries," he said.
According to the statement on the Web site linked to the FARC, Granda was in Venezuela "on the invitation of (socialist) organizations based in Venezuela, with the approval of government authorities."
Venezuela "has no proof" that Colombian agents participated in the kidnapping, said Chacon.
He added that Venezuela would "take action" if investigations showed that Colombian authorities were involved.
The Colombian government denies it arrested Granda in Venezuela.
Colombian officials contend the guerrilla leader was arrested on Dec 14, shortly after he crossed the border and arrived in Cucuta.
Opposition leaders in Venezuela along with some Colombian politicians have repeatedly accused Chavez, a self proclaimed "revolutionary," of collaborating with Colombia's leftist guerrillas.
Chavez has long denied aiding Colombia's two main rebel groups: the FARC, and the smaller National Liberation Army, which is known as the ELN.
The FARC and ELN have been fighting to overthrow the Colombian government for 40 years.
The conflict, in which right wing paramilitary groups that support the government are also involved, claims about 3500 lives each year.
A leader of the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) was killed along with four of his men in a clash with the army in the southeast, the military said.
The clash occurred in a rural area of San Vicente del Caguan, northwest of Caqueta department.
The death of Humberto Valbuena, leader of FARC's Teofilo Forero unit, was a heavy blow to the rebel force as he was leading operations of kidnappings and recruitment, said General Carlos Fracica, commander of Monday's offensive.
Humberto, alias Hierbas, was captured in 1999 but escaped in the middle of that year.
FARC, with 20000 combatants, is the country's largest and oldest rebel organization and allegedly finances itself through drug trafficking and kidnappings.
Colombia has been plagued by a four decade civil war, in which leftist rebels, far right paramilitaries and government troops fight each other, killing about 3500 people every year.
The leftist rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) on Monday rejected a government proposal to hold face to face talks at a foreign embassy in Bogota aimed at exchanging jailed rebels for hostages held by the guerrillas.
In a statement, FARC asked President Alvaro Uribe to grant the rebel group the two southern demilitarized zones, San Vicente del Caguan and Cartagena del Chaira, before discussions on a prisoner exchange take place, a demand that the government has already rejected.
On Oct 27, Uribe proposed to hold talks with FARC on the release of 15 jailed rebels at the Vatican's embassy or another diplomatic mission in Bogota in return for hostages held by FARC.
FARC said in the statement that it would not negotiate unless the two southern counties are demilitarized, allowing the rebels to transfer their dozens of hostages from a region where the government has launched a military attack.
The government on Monday reiterated that it would not demilitarize any zones because it has to guarantee the safety of the people across the country.
FARC also criticized the Uribe proposal and termed it as a political maneuver of the president, seeking to benefit his re election attempt for the year 2006, when his presidential term expires.
FARC is the largest insurgent group in Colombia with up to 20, 000 combatants across the country.
Colombia has been plagued by a four decade civil war, in which leftist rebels, far right paramilitaries and government troops fight each other, killing about 3500 people every year.
The office of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Colombia Friday urged the Colombian government to speed up proposals leading to the release of hostages kept by guerrilla forces.
Michael Fruhling, the office director, told the press it is indispensable to have a humanitarian agreement between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the government to release the hostages including politicians, three US citizens, and members of the military.
Some of them have been in the hands of rebels for six years.
FARC, the country's largest rebel organization, intended to swap these hostages for 500 imprisoned rebels.
It also demanded setting up two demilitarized zones in the south for the prisoner swap.
The government rejected FARC's request but announced last month releasing 50 jailed guerrillas as the first step to build confidence.
In addition, the government insisted any rebels freed in the exchange be exiled from Colombia or enter a government program to reincorporate them into civilian life.
FARC, established in the 1960s, has about 17000 members at present.
It has been in a warring state with the government since their cease fire negotiations failed in February 2002.
The Colombian government plans to pardon more than 30 members of the left wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) as the two sides negotiate a prisoners swap, a senior official told AFP Wednesday.
"Through this unilateral gesture, which will be announced once legal questions are settled, President Alvaro Ulribe is showing the FARC his desire to reach a humanitarian accord," said the official.
The official, who requested anonymity, said the government had an initial plan to free 37 rebel prisoners but the number could change as lawyers were still studying individual cases.
The two sides have been arguing over details of a swap.
Uribe announced in October that he was read to negotiate a prisoner exchange with the largest of the country's rebel groups.
In November, the FARC leadership rejected a proposition by Uribe to exchange 50 guerrillas against 59 hostages in FARC hands: three Americans, 22 politicians, including a Franco Colombian Ingrid Betancourt, and 34 military and police.
The Marxist FARC has about 17000 fighters and is said to be holding 1600 hostages.
Colombian insurgent organizations on Monday released 12 people kidnapped last Saturday in separate events in the western part of the country.
Of the victims, the National Liberation Army (ELN) released seven, while the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) freed five.
Last Saturday, the ELN kidnapped seven environmental researchers of the "Diego Luis Cordoba" Technological University of Choco in Chachajo city.
Meanwhile, the Front 47 of the FARC captured five individuals (gold miners) in central Choco.
The FARC, with 20000 members, is the largest rebel organization in Colombia, followed by the ELN, with 4000.
Both insurgent groups have their own operations in different parts of the country.
Choco's peace delegate, Ventura Diaz, confirmed the arrival of the researchers in Chachajo, except a social worker, who was taken to Quibdo, capital of Choco, to receive medical attention for her health problems.
The rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) has killed another indigenous leader, the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (ONIC) said Thursday.
Pervis Pacheco, leader of the Kankuamo Indians, was killed in Urumita municipality, south of La Guajira department after he had fled his community under threat from the FARC, the ONIC said.
Pacheco is the fourth indigenous leader murdered in less than a week in Colombia.
On Tuesday, the FARC, the largest rebel organization in the country with up to 20000 combatants, killed the Yanacona Indian leader Plinio Piamba and his son.
Last Saturday, the rebel group was believed to be responsible for the death of 70 year old Mariano Suarez, the top civil and spiritual leader of the Arhuaca Indians.
ONIC, which gathers some 800000 Indians in Colombia, condemned the killing and asked non governmental organizations in Colombia and abroad for intervention.
The Office of the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner condemned the murder of Suarez and demanded the FARC respect the rights of the indigenous communities and international humanitarian law.
Colombia has been plagued by a four decade civil war, in which leftist rebels, far right paramilitaries and government troops fight each other, killing about 3500 people every year.
Colombia's Supreme Court of Justice on Wednesday approved the extradition of two paramilitary leaders and one rebel FARC chief to the United States.
Washington had requested their extradition to face narco trafficking and money laundering charges in the United States.
The court ruled that the US request for paramilitary leaders Salvatore Mancuso and Carlos Castano who mysteriously disappeared in April as well as rebel chief "Simon Trinidad" of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia "complied with Colombian legislation."
Mancuso became the top paramilitary leader in Colombia after Castano's disappearance.
The rebel leader known as "Simon Trinidad" is locked up in a maximum security prison, making him the seniormost FARC leader captured by Colombian authorities.
The Colombian government on Thursday announced that it was pardoning 23 members of the left wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), as the two sides negotiate a prisoner swap.
The high commissioner for peace, Luis Carlos Restrepo, said the move was "a new attempt to convince the guerrillas to agree to a humanitarian accord."
Earlier Thursday, a senior official told AFP the government plans to pardon more than 30 members of the FARC.
"Through this unilateral gesture, ,President Alvaro Uribe is showing the FARC his desire to reach a humanitarian accord," the official said.
The official, who requested anonymity, said the government had an initial plan to free 37 rebel prisoners, but the number could change, as lawyers were still studying individual cases.
The two sides have been arguing over details of a swap.
Uribe announced in October that he was ready to negotiate a prisoner exchange with the largest of the country's rebel groups.

The Marxist FARC has about 17000 fighters and is said to be holding 1600 hostages.
The Colombian police arrested a leader of an assassination team belonging to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and responsible for over 50 assassinations, official sources said on Wednesday.
The sources said that Jose Orlando Rodriguez Penaloza was arrested on Tuesday by the secret police, or DAS, in southern Bogota.
According to DAS, Rodriguez headed a group of assassins under the FARC's leadership.
DAS said that Rodriguez, known by the alias of Bombom, was accused of ordering the killing of hostages held by FARC Front 42 in the central province of Cundinamarca when the families of the hostages failed to pay ransoms.
He added that Rodriguez also faced charges of the assassinations of Alberto Torres, mayor of the city of Quipile, Cundinamarca province, and Mesitas del Colegio, a town councilor.
Front 42, headed by Bernardo Mosquera, alias El Negro Antonio, was considered one of the top kidnappers in Colombia.
Add a tenth planet to the solar system or possibly subtract one.
Astronomers announced Friday that they have found a lump of rock and ice that is larger than Pluto and the farthest known object in the solar system.
The discovery will likely rekindle debate over the definition of "planet" and whether Pluto still merits the designation.
The new object as yet unnamed, but temporarily known as 2003 UB313 is now 9 billion miles away from the sun, or 97 times as far away as the Earth and about three times Pluto's current distance from the sun.
Its 560 year elliptical orbit brings it as close as 3.3 billion miles.
Pluto's orbit ranges between 2.7 billion and 4.6 billion miles.
The astronomers do not have an exact size for the new planet, but its brightness and distance tell them that it is larger than Pluto, the smallest of the nine known planets.
"It is guaranteed bigger than Pluto," said Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at Caltech and a member of the team that made the discovery.
The discovery was made Jan 8 at Palomar Observatory in California.
Brown and the other members of the team Chadwick A. Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii and David L. Rabinowitz of Yale then found that they had, unknowingly, taken images of the planet, using the observatory's 48 inch telescope, as far back as 2003.
Last year, the same team announced the discovery of a distant body they named Sedna, which, until the latest discovery, had held the title of farthest known object in the solar system.
What is most surprising is that the orbit of the planet is sharply skewed to most of the rest of the solar system.
The orbits of the most of the planets lie close to the same plane as Earth's, known as the ecliptic plane.
The orbit of 2003 UB313 is tilted by 44 degrees.
"That blows my mind," said Harold Levison of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., who was not involved in the discovery.
"Getting something up that high is very hard."
The new planet could have been easily discovered much sooner if anyone had looked at that part of the sky.
"It's because no one looks that far off the ecliptic," Brown said.
"No one expects to have an inclination that high."
It's been 75 years since the discovery of Pluto, but it remains a mystery.
Perhaps in another 10 years some of its secrets will be revealed when a space probe gets close enough for a good look.
Pluto was quickly heralded as the ninth planet in the solar system when it was spotted Feb 18, 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh, a young amateur astronomer at Lowell Observatory.
It still holds that title today, if somewhat tenuously.
"It's a misbehaved planet if you want to think about it as a planet," said Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of New York's Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History.
Tyson provocatively removed Pluto from his exhibit of planets five years ago, lumping it instead with a belt of comets at the edge of the solar system.
"I still have folders of hate mail from third graders," he said.
Pluto was discovered in a search for a theoretical ninth planet.
The 26 year old Tombaugh was given the assignment.
Had he not been so attentive, he might have missed Pluto as he stared through an eyepiece while switching back and forth between photographic images of the night sky over northern Arizona.
But he believed right away the recurring speck he saw was the elusive Planet X later called Pluto.
Generations of schoolchildren grew up memorizing solar system charts that included Pluto.
But shortly after Tombaugh died in 1997, some astronomers suggested that the International Astronomical Union, a professional astronomers group, should demote the tiniest planet.
At the time it was discovered, Pluto was the only known object beyond Neptune in the solar system.
When its moon, Charon, was spotted, that seemingly confirmed Pluto's planet status.
But astronomers also have found about 1000 other small icy objects beyond Neptune rotating around the sun.
There may be as many as 100000 of these bodies in what's called the Kuiper Belt, said Bob Millis, director of Lowell Observatory.
Pluto, with its elongated orbit and odd orbital plane, seems to behave more like other Kuiper Belt objects than other planets, some astronomers say.
They also point out Pluto is very small, smaller than Earth's moon.
"You start to see where Pluto fits in better with Kuiper objects," said Hal Weaver, project scientist on the New Horizons mission, which hopes to launch a probe to Pluto next year, possibly reaching it as early as 2015.
Tyson's decision at the Hayden Planetarium to remove Pluto from the planets and lump it with the Kuiper Belt seemed to strike a nerve.
Tyson speculates that the name the same as the Disney character which also debuted in 1930 and its position as the littlest planet make it a favorite with schoolchildren.
"The Plutocracy, as I like to call it, is greater than we want to admit to ourselves," Tyson joked.
But others have pointed out that Pluto remains unique among known objects.
"If you don't call it (a planet), what else do you call it?" asked Kevin Schindler, senior supervisor of public programs at Lowell.
Pluto is very spherical like other planets.
Asteroids and comets tend to be misshapen, said Weaver, a senior scientist at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory.
Pluto also has an atmosphere and seasons.
Complicating the debate is that there is no official definition for a planet.
Setting standards like size limits or orbital patterns potentially invites other objects to take the "planet" label, while throwing Pluto out.
"It's a controversy that flares up and then subsides.
I don't know what the outcome will be," said Millis.
"It's more interesting to me: What is Pluto really like, than what is Pluto?"
Astronomers hope to get some answers to that question, and the birth of the solar system, with the New Horizons mission.
But it will take nearly a decade to reach the icy rock.
In any event, the debate over what to call Pluto is mostly a question of semantics, Weaver said.
And even if it somehow loses planet status, he believes it might still be the largest of the Kuiper Belt objects.
"Some people thought (the debate) was a slight of Clyde Tombaugh.
You were trying to take away his planet," Weaver said.
"I'm sure that it was nothing personal."
In the not too distant future, maps of the solar system may be redrawn to add another planet or perhaps take one away.
Last month, when scientists announced the discovery of a possible 10th planet, some 9 billion miles from the sun, they reignited a long running debate about what a true planet is.
They are grappling with whether the newly found celestial body, known for now as 2003 UB313, should be granted planetary status, and if it is not, whether Pluto, a like size ice ball in a far orbit of the sun, should be stripped of the title.
Astronomers are afire over the shake up, and their musings have been lighting up the news media.
But they aren't the only ones excited about the discovery.
Their mystical cousins, astrologers, have also been jolted, they are speculating about what it might mean for their cosmic readings and prophecies.
After all, they, too, are students of the solar system.
Astrologers often employ the maxim "as above, so below."
Now suddenly that which is "above" may be radically changed.
"It's exciting," said Richard Brown, an astrologer from Toronto.
"I'm immediately on the Internet, and I'm just jumping up and down."
Michael E. Brown (no relation to Richard), an astronomer and a member of the team that discovered 2003 UB313, said he has been peppered with inquiries from astrologers seeking to know the exact moment he made his observation.
Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology, subsequently posted the time of discovery on his Web page for their benefit, he said, because he has always appreciated astrologers' enthusiasm for the heavens.
"The astronomical world frequently sits around and bickers," he said.
"It's nice to see a group sit around and take pleasure in new discoveries."
If 2003 UB313 is a 10th planet, astrologers say it may have a profound influence over people's lives, and thus on the forecasts astrologers make.
But its potency cannot be discerned until perhaps several years after the astronomical debate is settled, when astronomers have had time to chart its orbit.
So astrologers are not inclined to do anything hasty.
There will be no tearing up of charts, no hurriedly penciling in a new planet and certainly no crossing out of Pluto, a body that many astrologers hold near and dear.
On the contrary, astrologers seem to have reached an unspoken consensus to take a wait and see approach.
Wait and see if there is a 10th planet.
Then wait and observe its influence on human life.
Astrologers have been searching the sky for centuries for clues to how the positions of stars and planets could affect life on Earth.
Their celestial observations intrigued Chaucer, Shakespeare and even Galileo.
The profession still thrives, supported in no small part it seems by people who say they do not really believe in it, as evidenced by the enormous popularity of horoscopes in magazines, newspapers and on the Web.
Last year America Online's most popular search term was "horoscope."
A Gallup Poll telephone survey conducted in June found that 25 percent of Americans believe that the position of the stars and planets can affect people's lives.
"We like to think of ourselves as the second oldest profession," said Richard Brown, the astrologer.
Michael Brown said, "I think of it as entertainment," adding that his wife reads her horoscope in the newspaper each morning, though not because she believes the predictions will come true.
But to some critics, the discovery of a potential 10th planet is just more evidence that astrology is humbug.
If astrologers were able to detect the influences of planets on people's lives accurately, should they not have noticed the influence of a 10th planet long before astronomers detected it?
"You would think astrologers would have noticed after 2000 years of making predictions that every 20 years or so things would get messed up," said Phil Plait, an astronomer at Sonoma State University, in Rohnert Park, Calif. "And then someone would say, 'Maybe there's another planet out there."'
Astrologists argue that they have never asserted that the known planets and stars account for every last detail of human life.
"We assume there are going to be other planets," said Deb McBride, an astrologer in Brooklyn.
Leigh Oswald, an astrologer in London, said unknown forces may determine when scientists discover new planets.
"A planet is discovered when it's appropriate for humanity to understand it," she said.
"In other words, when we are ready for it."
Throughout history, when faced with the addition of a new planet, many astrologers have duly figured out how to use it in their calculations.
Pluto, the most recently discovered planet, is so tightly woven into astrological charts, to lose it would be unthinkable, Oswald said.
"It's been observed to have a huge influence on people's lives."
Because Pluto is an outer planet, it operates on a level that affects humanity as a whole as well as individuals, astrologers say.
(The farther out a planet is, theoretically, the more global its effects.)
Named for the Greek god of the underworld, Pluto brings about unexpected changes.
"It's usually dark," McBride said.
"It's usually a huge upheaval in someone's life."
That upheaval in a person's health, family or career is generally followed by a rebuilding, a resurrection, she said.
Pluto is in Sagittarius right now, which to astrologers means it is exerting an influence on larger social forces like religions, ideologies and cultural traditions.
"When you put Pluto in a sign like Sagittarius, you start getting religious wars, differences in cultures," McBride said.
Astrologers are especially eager to learn 2003 UB313's permanent name, because in their business, a celestial object's name is essential to its interpretation.
"Naming is important, particularly when a name has a mythological charge to it," said Barry Perlman, a San Francisco astrologer.
"You're connecting it to a lineage of cultural traditions."
Even though a planet's name is chosen by mere mortals, astrologers do not consider the choice a matter of chance.
Rather, they see it arising from an alignment of unseen forces that affect the collective human unconscious.
They find it no accident that Pluto, for example, was discovered in 1930, in the era of the rise of Nazism and the development of the atomic bomb.
Michael Brown has been informally calling the possible new planet Xena, after the title character from the cult television series "Xena: Warrior Princess."
(He has given equally playful nicknames to other planetary bodies he has discovered, including Santa, Easter Bunny and Flying Dutchman.)
The official name of 2003 UB313 has yet to be determined, however.
First, the International Astronomical Union, which has the last word in naming celestial objects, has to decide if it is a planet, something that is unlikely to happen before 2006, Brown said.
He would not reveal the name his team has nominated, but allowed that it is neither Xena nor the name of any Greek or Roman god.
With or without a new planet, some astrologers say they already have plenty to study, because they believe that celestial bodies, from the moon to the billions of stars, can be incorporated into readings.
"There's a whole treasure trove that we haven't used," said John Cook, an astrologer from New York City.
Like many astrologers, Cook is fascinated by the work of astronomers, but he knows the feeling is rarely mutual.
"Every time people meet an astronomer, they ask them what their sun sign is, and they hate that," Cook said with a chuckle.
But Michael Brown, a Gemini, doesn't mind.
"I'm happy that they're thinking about the solar system," he said, "even if I don't agree."
The astronomers who claim to have discovered the 10th planet in the solar system have made another intriguing announcement: it has a moon.
While observing the new, so called planet from Hawaii last month, a team of astronomers led by Michael Brown of the California Institute of Technology spotted a faint object trailing next to it.
Because it was moving, astronomers ruled it was a moon and not a background star, which is stationary.
The moon discovery is important because it can help scientists determine the new planet's mass.
In July, Brown announced the discovery of an icy, rocky object larger than Pluto in the Kuiper Belt, a disc of icy bodies beyond Neptune.
Brown labeled the object a planet and nicknamed it Xena after the lead character in the former TV series "Xena: Warrior Princess."
By determining the moon's distance and orbit around Xena, scientists can calculate how heavy Xena is.
For example, the faster a moon goes around a planet, the more massive a planet is.
But the newly discovered moon, nicknamed Gabrielle after Xena's faithful traveling sidekick in the TV series, likely will not quell the debate over what exactly is a planet and whether Pluto should keep its status.
The problem is there is no official definition for a planet and setting standards like size limits potentially invites other objects to take the "planet" label.
Possessing a moon is not a criteria of planethood since Mercury and Venus are moonless planets.
Brown said he expected to find a moon orbiting Xena because many Kuiper Belt objects are paired with moons.
The moon is about 155 miles wide and 60 times fainter than Xena, the farthest known object in the solar system.
It is currently 9 billion miles away from the sun, or about three times Pluto's current distance from the sun.
Scientists believe Xena's moon was formed when Kuiper Belt objects collided with one another.
The Earth's moon formed in a similar way when Earth crashed into an object the size of Mars.
The moon was first spotted by a 10 meter telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii on Sept 10.
Scientists expect to learn more about the moon's composition during further observations with the Hubble Space Telescope in November.
Brown planned to submit a paper describing the moon discovery to the Astrophysical Journal next week.
The International Astronomical Union, a group of scientists responsible for naming planets, is deciding on formal names for Xena and Gabrielle.
Between feedings and diaper changes of his newborn daughter, Michael E. Brown may yet find an 11th planet.
Once conducted almost exclusively on cold, lonely nights, observational astronomy these days is often done under bright California sunshine.
When he has a few spare minutes, Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology, downloads images taken during a previous night by a robotically driven telescope at Palomar Observatory 100 miles away.
Each night, the telescope scans a different swath of sky, photographing each patch three times, spaced an hour and a half apart.
In any one of the photographs, a planet or some other icy body at the edge of the solar system looks just like a star.
Unlike a star, it moves between the exposures.
Brown's computer programs flag potential discoveries for him to inspect.
He quickly dismisses almost all of them double images caused by a bumping of the telescope, blurriness from whirls in the atmosphere or random noise.
But sometimes, like last Jan 5, he spots a moving dot.
Brown had rewritten his software to look for slower moving and more distant objects.
On that morning, he was sitting in his Caltech office unremarkable university turf sparsely decorated with a not full bottle of Jack Daniel's, a dragon mobile, a dinosaur toothbrush, a Mr Potato Head and other toys and knickknacks that long predated parenthood and re examining images from nearly a year and a half earlier, Oct 21, 2003.
The first several candidates offered by the computer were the usual garbled images.
Then he saw it: a bright, unmistakably round dot moving across the star field.
He did a quick calculation.
Even if this new object reflected 100 percent of the sunlight that hit it and nothing is perfectly reflective it would still be almost as large as Pluto.
Without any additional data, Brown knew he had discovered what could be the 10th planet.
He noted the time: 11:20 a.m.
Brown knew that astrologers would ask because they had asked for that information after earlier discoveries of smaller objects in the Kuiper Bel.
He thought about a bet he had made with a friend, for five bottles of champagne, that he would discover something larger than Pluto by Jan 1, 2005, a deadline that had passed five days earlier.
He sent her an e mail message asking for a five day extension.
Brown seems destined for future astronomy textbooks, either as the discoverer of the first new planet in 75 years or as the man who pushed Pluto out of the planetary pantheon.
Astronomers have long argued over whether Pluto should be called a planet and speculated that ice balls larger than Pluto might be hiding in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of debris beyond the orbit of Neptune.
Several objects approaching the size of Pluto have been discovered in recent years.
Brown and two colleagues, David Rabinowitz of Yale and Chad Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii, were the first to point to something that is almost certainly larger than Pluto.
"If people want to get rid of Pluto, I'm more than happy to get rid of Pluto and say this one isn't a planet, either," Brown said.
"If culturally we would be willing to accept a scientific definition, that would be great," he continued.
"The only thing that would make me unhappy is if Pluto remained a planet, and this one was not one."
So far, little is known about the new planet, which carries the temporary designation of 2003 UB313.
It is currently 9 billion miles from the sun, at the farthest point of its 560 year orbit.
A couple of centuries from now, its elliptical trajectory will take it within 3.3 billion miles of the sun, closer than portions of Pluto's orbit.
And the orbit is surprisingly askew.
While most of the solar system circles the Sun in a flat plane, the new planet's orbit is tilted about 45 degrees from the plane.
Planet finding was not a career goal for Brown.
Until recently, he was among those who argued that nothing in the Kuiper Belt deserved to be called a planet, not even Pluto.
Brown, 40, grew up in Alabama, a child of the 1970s.
His father, an engineer at IBM, had moved to Huntsville to work on the giant Saturn rockets, which were being designed at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center to carry astronauts to the moon.
When he was finishing his undergraduate degree in physics at Princeton, he thought he would pursue theoretical work in cosmology, devising ideas about how the universe came together.
Then James Peebles, a physics professor at Princeton, mentioned to him how astronomy needed more observers actually looking at the sky.
"That was it," Brown recalled.
"As soon as he said it, I was like, OK."
In graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, he still planned to work on the far, far away distant galaxies that blast out loud radio signals.
His thesis adviser, Hyron Spinrad, had his graduate students also work on comets, because he was interested in them and could not get help otherwise.
Brown was captivated as well.
"I thought, this stuff is cool," he said.
That brought his interests inside the solar system.
Later, Brown came across a tiny, little used 24 inch telescope at the Lick Observatory outside San Jose, Calif. "You find the telescope first and then find your thesis program," he said.
His thesis topic turned out to be the volcanoes on Io, one of the moons of Jupiter, and how the gases from the volcanoes are swept up into Jupiter's magnetic fields, accelerated into orbit around Jupiter and then slammed back into Io at 125000 miles per hour.
He entered the planet searching business through a chance opportunity.
When he arrived at Caltech a decade ago, the 48 inch Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar was just finishing up a large sky survey.
While many astronomers clamor to use Palomar's main 200 inch telescope, Brown realized he could easily get ample time on the smaller one.
So, just as he did at Lick, he looked for a project to fit the telescope.
The first Kuiper Belt object had been discovered a few years earlier, and Brown thought it would be useful to do a systematic sweep of the sky to look for others.
In past centuries, the trick to discovering a planet was knowing exactly where to look.
Now, computers and automated telescopes have allowed a new strategy: look everywhere.
Brown has a love of code names, so he and his colleagues decided that if they ever found something larger than Pluto, they would give it the code name Xena, after the television series.
It was also partly a nod to Planet X, a long hypothesized massive planet in the outer solar system.
In 2002, Brown and Trujillo turned up their first big find: a Kuiper Belt object about 775 miles wide, or about as large as Pluto's moon, Charon.
They named it Quaoar, after a god in Native American mythology, and learned their first lesson in astronomical discovery: find a pronounceable name.
(Quaoar is pronounced KWAH o wahr.)
A year later, Brown, Trujillo and Rabinowitz of Yale found something stranger, an object larger than Quaoar and much farther out, 8 billion miles.
And stranger yet, its 11000 year orbit carried it out as far as 84 billion miles, far beyond anything else known in the solar system.
Initially, they excitedly thought it might be larger than Pluto and called it Xena for a few days.
But further measurements and calculations indicated it was probably no larger than three quarters the diameter of Pluto.
When they announced the discovery last year, they gave it the name of Sedna, after an Inuit goddess.
The name was easily pronounceable, but it irritated some astronomers, especially amateur asteroid searchers, who felt Brown had again flouted the International Astronomical Union's naming rules.
The rules prohibit discoverers from publicly announcing any name, even a tentative one, before the union approves it, a process that takes months to years.
The critics wanted the union to rebuke Brown and reject the name.
One amateur astronomer, Reiner M. Stoss, even proposed Sedna as a name for a small asteroid discovered earlier, to thwart Brown.
Brown acknowledged, "I consciously broke the rules," but he felt that the preliminary designation, 2003 VB12, was too obscure and confusing for a noteworthy addition to the solar system.
"I thought, this is stupid," he said.
"This object needs to have a name before it goes public."
After Sedna, the astronomers also realized that there could be more discoveries lurking in their photographs.
Brown finds that betting is an effective way to spur scientific progress.
He would have found the planet sooner or later, but late last year he realized that his best hope for winning the champagne bet was to sift through thousands of candidates in the old images.
On Dec 20, going through the images from the previous May, he discovered a new bright Kuiper Belt object.
It was big, but not big enough.
He gave that one the code name of Santa.
When he later discovered a moon around Santa, he gave the moon the code name Rudolph.
(When he discovered yet another Kuiper Belt object in April, he continued in the holiday vein and named that one Easter Bunny.
He even had a code name for his daughter before she was born.
The whiteboard in his office had a list of tasks labeled "TDBP" To Do Before Petunia.)
He spent Christmas through New Year's examining old images.
Nothing turned up.
Then on Jan 5 not Jan 8 as he had said at his news conference he finally found one he could call Xena.
"What if it's the size of Mercury?" he mused in his notes.
This time, Brown decided to play by the International Astronomical Union's rules and did not announce his real intended name for 2003 UB313, leading to rumors that he had officially proposed Xena.
Meanwhile, Brown, on family leave until the end of year, found a new set of data to work with: his daughter Lilah's sleeping and eating patterns.
In the hospital, he and his wife had, like many new parents, written down a record of feeding and sleeping times.
Brown wrote a computer program to generate colorful charts from the information and put them online at lilahbrown.com.
"Who wouldn't be fascinated?"
Brown asked.
"Well, I guess, most people."
Black bars indicate the times that his wife, Diane Binney, is breast feeding Lilah.
Blue bars indicate when Brown is giving her a bottle.
Green bars indicate the hours Lilah is awake and content, red bars indicate the fussy times.
Brown said he hoped to find a pattern in Lilah's sleep cycle she has been waking up, on average, every 2.5 hours.
If one nap lasted only 1.5 hours, would that mean the next nap would last 3.5 hours, giving her parents a chance to rest?
A chart with cloudlike splatter of data points gave the unfortunate answer.
"There is absolutely no correlation," Brown said.
Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology have discovered what they believe is the tenth and most distant planet in our solar system, a ball of rock that is about twice as big as Pluto and about three times as far out.
The new object, temporarily called 2003 UB313, is currently at its farthest distance from the sun, about 97 times the distance between the sun and Earth.
It lies in the fringes of the Kuiper Belt, a conglomeration of asteroids, comets and other materials circling the sun well beyond the orbit of Pluto.
When it gets halfway through its orbit in 280 years, 2003 UB313 will be about 36 times the Earth sun distance or nearly as close as Neptune.
"If Pluto is a planet, then anything larger than Pluto is a planet, and this is definitely larger than Pluto," said Caltech astronomer Michael A. Brown, who announced the discovery at anews conference Friday.
Brown's claim of planethood for 2003 UB313 is certain to be controversial.
Astronomers have long debated whether Pluto is a planet because of its small size and odd orbit, although many scientists are content to retain its current designation.
The surface of the new object is very similar to that of Pluto, a mixture of about 70 percent rock and 30 percent water ice.
It is very cold, probably about minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
"It's not a very pleasant place to live," Brown said.
Brown said 2003 UB313 has probably not been discovered before because its orbit lies at a 45 degree angle from the plane, known as the ecliptic, in which the nine known planets circle the sun.
"Nobody looks that high up in the sky," he said.
He only looked there, he said, because he could not find any more objects in the ecliptic.
Brown first saw the new planet Jan 8 using the 48 inch Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar Observatory, along with his colleagues Chad Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory and David Rabinowitz of Yale University.
It had actually been photographed first in 2003 hence the name but nobody realized what it was until its motion became apparent.
The planet 2003 UB313 has since been observed with a variety of other telescopes.
Researchers have attempted to measure its heat output with the Spitzer Space Telescope, but the orbiting observatory could not find it, putting an upper limit on its size of twice Pluto's diameter.
Brown said that he had not intended to announce the finding until he had pinned down the exact size, but someone "with more cleverness than scruples" hacked into his restricted Web site Thursday night and was planning to announce the discovery.
"We really didn't have a choice," he said.
He said he has selected a name for the new planet and submitted it to the International Astronomical Union, but he would not reveal it until that body makes a decision.
(Begin optional trim) The new object is currently the third brightest body in the Kuiper Belt.
The discovery of the second brightest object was announced Thursday by a group headed by Jose Luis Ortiz of the Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain.
That object, called 2003 EL61, is about 60 percent the size of Pluto about the same as another body, called Sedna, that Brown discovered last year.
Brown and Trujillo also discovered another large Kuiper object, called Quaoar, in 2002.
Like Sedna, however, Quaoar is smaller than Pluto.
The object detected by the Spanish astronomers is about 52 times the Earth sun distance at its farthest point from the sun.
Its closest approach to the sun also lies near Neptune's orbit.
It is different from the previously discovered Kuiper bodies in that it has a moon that circles it every 49 days in a highly elliptical orbit.
That moon has about 1 percent of the mass of the parent body.
Brown had also been tracking 2003 EL61 and was surprised when the Spanish astronomers made their announcement Thursday.
He said he has also been tracking another object, about the same size and distance from the sun as 2003 EL61, but brighter still.
(End optional trim) Brown said 2003 UB313 can easily be observed by amateurs with good telescopes.
It is currently straight overhead in the early morning, but in six months it will be visible in the evening.
So maybe Pluto is a planet after all.
Astronomers in recent years were having doubts.
Perhaps Pluto, small, distant and poorly observed, should be downgraded from true planet to a mere Kuiper Belt Object, or KBO, one of the thousands of icy bodies orbiting beyond Neptune that probably are leftovers from the creation of the outer solar system.
"People were finding all these KBOs that were huge, literally half the size of Pluto or larger," said John Stansberry, an astronomer at the University of Arizona.
"But those supposed sizes were based on assumptions that KBOs have low albedos, similar to comets."
Albedo is a measure of how much light an object reflects.
The more light it reflects, the higher its albedo and the smaller its size needs to be.
In a report last week at a meeting of planetary scientists in Louisville, Ky., Stansberry said a recently discovered KBO, first estimated to be 932 miles in diameter, appeared in new observations to be no more than 435 miles wide.
It was a matter of the albedo 18 percent, instead of the assumed 4 percent for previous calculations.
The measured object, designated 2002 AW197, is one of the largest nonplanet bodies in the solar system, and yet is only about 30 percent as large as the 1400 mile wide Pluto.
The revised estimate is based on the first results from a survey of large Kuiper Belt Objects by the Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared observatory in Earth orbit.
As more KBO albedos are studied, astronomers should find out if the first object is typical, or an oddball, and if Pluto appears to be significantly different from these smaller objects.
A planned survey of 30 such objects, Stansberry said, "will help us determine what their compositions are, how they evolve, how massive they are, what their real size distributions and dynamics are and how Pluto fits into the whole picture."
Michael Shara, chairman of the astrophysics department at the Hayden Planetarium in New York, said the Spitzer telescope's infrared observations "appear rock solid and a terrific piece of work."
The planetarium, at the American Museum of Natural History, has had a leading role in reclassifying Pluto.
In its exhibition hall, eight planets are prominently displayed, and the supposed ninth, Pluto, rates only a plaque, casting doubt on its status as a planet.
"We remain convinced that Pluto is not a planet, but one of the Kuiper Belt Objects," Shara said.
But, he allowed, the new observations could eventually restore Pluto's planetary status.
A US astronomer announced Friday he had discovered what could be a 10th planet in the outer reaches of the solar system nearly 15 billion kilometers (nine billion miles) from earth.
If confirmed, the discovery by Professor Mike Brown of the respected California Institute of Technology would be the first of a planet since Pluto was identified in 1930.
The body is "the 10th planet of the solar system," said Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy in a phone conference from CalTech in the town of Pasadena.
"It's the farthest object ever discovered to orbit around the sun."
"It's definitely bigger than Pluto," he said of the body made up of ice and rock.
The planet is a typical member of the Kuiper belt, but its sheer size in relation to the nine known planets means that it can only be classified as a planet, Brown said.
Currently about 97 times further from the sun than the Earth, the planet is the farthest known object in the solar system, and the third brightest of the Kuiper belt objects.
But Brown conceded that the discovery would likely rekindle debate over the definition of "planet" and whether Pluto should still be regarded as one.
When a group of Spanish astronomers reported in July that they had discovered a spectacular addition to the solar system, a bright ball of ice almost as big as Pluto sailing the depths of space out beyond Neptune, Dr Michael Brown of Caltech chalked it up to coincidence and bad luck.
His own group had been tracking the object, now known as 2003 EL61, for months but had told no one.
He sent the leader of the group, Dr Jose Luis Ortiz, of the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia, in Granada, a congratulatory e mail message.
Now Brown has asked for an investigation of Ortiz's discovery, alleging a serious breach of scientific ethics.
Archival records, he said, show that only a day before the discovery was reported, computers traced to Ortiz and his student Pablo Santos Sanz visited a Web site containing data on where and when the Caltech group's telescope was pointed.
The information in these observing logs could have been used to help find the object on the Spanish images, taken more than two years ago, or simply to confirm that both groups discovered the same object.
Depending on what the Spanish astronomers did, their failure to mention the Caltech observations could be considered scientific dishonesty or even fraud, Brown suggests.
In comments for his Web site (www.gps.caltech.edu/(TILDE)mbrown/planetlila), which includes a detailed timeline of the events surrounding the July announcement, he writes: "It is not clear from the timeline precisely what Ortiz and Santos Sanz knew and how they used the records that they accessed.
They were required by the standards of science, however, to acknowledge their use of our Web based records."
In an e mail message to Dr Brian Marsden of the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who is director of International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center, the clearinghouse for such discoveries, Brown wrote on Aug 15, "I request that Ortiz et al. be stripped of official discovery status and that the IAU issue a statement condemning their actions."
Ortiz did not respond to numerous e mail messages and telephone calls.
Last week in an e mail message to Brown, Ortiz neither admitted nor denied looking at the observing logs.
Instead he criticized Brown's failure to report discoveries promptly to the Minor Planet Center, saying that his penchant for "hiding objects" had alienated other astronomers and harmed science.
"And remember," he said in the message, which Brown provided to The New York Times, "the only reason why we are now exchanging e mail is because you did not report your object."
But Jose Carlos del Toro Iniesta, director of the Andalusian institute, said in an e mail message that he intended to investigate Brown's allegations, adding, "I beg your understanding in separating clearly the institute as a whole from its individual members: the researchers' actions are their sole responsibility."
The spectacular allegation has flummoxed the International Astronomical Union.
Saying that he and his colleagues had never been fooled before, Marsden admitted that the IAU had no protocol for adjudicating such a dispute.
Dr Robert Kirshner, a Harvard astronomer and the president of the American Astronomical Association, said, "I don't think we have a method other than public tantrums to resolve these problems."
The imbroglio illustrates the ethical dangers and pitfalls of doing science in the Internet age, where a little clicking can bring you a shocking amount of information about what your colleagues and rivals are up to.
There is a long history of astronomers jealously guarding the coordinates of some celestial phenomenon while they try to figure out what it is, and of others trying to get in on the action.
In 1930, when Pluto was discovered, the Lowell Observatory, home of the discoverer Clyde Tombaugh, withheld details of its location because they wanted to be the first to calculate its orbit.
Matthew Holman, a Harvard planetary astronomer, said that in the old days when the logbooks were real books sitting by the telescope, some astronomers would write down fictitious coordinates and objects to cover their tracks.
With electronic records, Brown said, "It's important for scientists to discuss what's OK and what is not."
Richard Pogge, an Ohio State astronomer who uncovered the apparent breach, said that scientists had long lived mostly successfully by a kind of honor system.
Astronomers, he said, routinely serve on time allocation committees for telescopes and peer review panels without stealing one another's ideas.
"It allows us to have an open, collaborative community," he said.
The idea that someone could abuse that openness, he said, "goes to the whole idea of trust in our community."
Brown, with his colleagues Dr David L. Rabinowitz of Yale and Chadwick A. Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii, is currently famous as the discoverer of the "10th planet."
Ortiz, who received his Ph.D. from the University of Granada in 1994 for work on the clouds of Jupiter and Saturn, is not as well known.
Glenn Orton, of Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where Ortiz worked as a postdoctoral fellow, called him "an impressive worker" and said he had recommended him for several jobs over the past years.
Since 2002, Ortiz and his colleagues have been looking for so called trans Neptunian objects in the outer solar system with a brace of small telescopes at the Sierra Nevada Observatory, in Granada.
The EL61 object appears to have been their first big hit.
According to Ortiz, it was first spotted on July 25 by Santos Sanz as a slow moving object on images taken in March 2003.
He e mailed this news to the Minor Planet Center on July 27, but it attracted no attention, partly because there was not enough information to tell other observers where to look for it.
The next night Ortiz reported that his group had been able to trace the object on various old photographs back to 1955, enabling a group at the Astronomical Observatory of Mallorca to observe it.
After checking for themselves that the object was real, Marsden's team disseminated the details to the rest of the astronomical world on its Web site and by e mail.
The new body would have been a prize for any astronomer.
At the time it was the brightest and largest object next to Pluto yet found in the Kuiper belt, a ring of debris that stretches out beyond Neptune.
Except that it had already been discovered.
Brown had planned to report the object, which his team had discovered in December 2004 and nicknamed Santa, at a meeting last week.
In fact, he had described it in abstracts sent to the American Astronomical Society, abstracts available to anyone with a computer and familiarity with astronomical jargon, only a week before, on July 20.
Ortiz's report raised eyebrows at the astronomical union because he and his telescopes were relatively unknown and because two years had elapsed since the discovery pictures were taken.
Struck by the similarity of the objects and the close timing of Ortiz's announcement, Marsden said he had told Brown that he was worried that a leak might have occurred.
In fact, Brown himself had inadvertently made such a leak possible.
In the abstracts he referred to "Santa" by a code name, K40506A, which was the same code name his team had used in its observing logs.
As a result, as Brown discovered to his horror the night of Ortiz's announcement, any astronomer who read the abstracts and typed "K40506A" into an Internet search program would be taken to a Web site containing the observing logs of Smarts, the Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System.
It was one of those telescopes, at the Cerro Tololo Inter American Observatory in Chile, that Brown and his colleagues were using to track the object.
The telescope is one of four owned by a consortium of universities and operated by two observing assistants at the observatory.
The Web site, which is public, does not contain data obtained during observations but does tell where the telescope was pointed.
Shaken by that news that his observations were so accessible, Brown hastily called a news conference to announce his ace in the hole, a new planet bigger than Pluto, at 7 p.m. on Friday, July 29, "Perhaps the single best time to announce news that you want no one to hear," as he put it on his Web site.
In an e mail message, he apologized to Ortiz ahead of time for being about to overshadow him.
Nevertheless questions lingered among minor planet astronomers about whether Ortiz's group might have helped themselves to Brown's observing logs, suspicions that Ortiz found irritating.
"I do not enjoy the distrust on our work and so much questioning," he wrote to Dr Daniel Green of the astronomical union on Aug 5 in an e mail message, which Green provided to The New York Times.
But now evidence has been offered that Ortiz and his group did access the observing logs.
Prompted by questions by Rabinowitz of Yale, one of Brown's team members, Pogge, who maintains the Smarts telescope Web site, decided to investigate the traffic on the site.
He found that computers from an unfamiliar address had visited the Web site eight times from July 26 to 28, when the Spanish group was making its announcement.
Each time the computers went straight to pages deep within the site that described the Brown group's observations of K40506A.
The first three visits happened a few minutes apart early on July 26, a day and a half before the Ortiz group made its announcement.
Another cluster of hits came on the morning of the July 28 before the object was observed in Mallorca and Ortiz made his more complete report to the astronomical union.
Pogge was able to trace the computers through the so called IPP numbers, which the Internet assigns to each computer on it.
Those numbers eventually led him to the Web site of the Andalusian Institute.
Pogge said he gasped out loud when it popped up.
"I remember saying, 'Oh no, oh no, oh no,' over and over again," he said.
Moreover, the IPP numbers of the intruders match the numbers on the e mail messages Santos Sanz and Ortiz sent to the Minor Planet office, according to Marsden.
Pogge called Brown on Aug 8.
Brown in turn sent an e mail message to Ortiz asking for an explanation, but by then all of Spain seemed to be on vacation.
It was not until early this month that Iniesta and Ortiz wrote back, the latter to say that he was still on vacation and saw no need to respond further until Sept 15.
In the absence of further information, exactly what Ortiz did with the observing logs is likely to remain a mystery.
Were he and his colleagues only checking to see if Brown's object was the same as theirs to confirm their own discovery?
Or did they use the information to find the object and beat the Caltech team?
Both actions would violate scientific ethics but with varying degrees of seriousness, astronomers said.
John Huchra, an astronomer and the vice provost for research policy at Harvard, said that at some level it is all right to use knowledge of what a rival group is doing.
"If you hear them give a talk at a conference, it's fair game," he said, "but if you found it in the trash bin or the copier, that's not kosher."
If you used tainted information to beat out the other group, he said, the director of the observatory (the only authority in this system) could forbid publication and banish you from the telescope.
"If they were just confirming," he went on, "there's still a tinge here.
It's not kosher to point your telescope at somebody else's object, unless you ask."
Ben Oppenheimer, an astronomer and extrasolar planet hunter at the American Museum of Natural History, said that he thought it was unethical to use tainted information in any way, but added: "It's a borderline case, though, because the logs were public.
I don't know why that information was so freely available."
One complicating factor is that professionals like Brown tend to nurse their work along in private until they are ready to publish a major scientific paper.
This practice has sometimes created tension among the minor planet observers, including a large number of amateurs who take pride in spotting comets, uncharted asteroids and other objects before the professionals.
In his response to Brown, Ortiz offered to collaborate with him on the naming of 2003 EL61 if Brown would change his secretive ways.
Brown called Ortiz's e mail message "astonishing."
Regarding the practice of guarding his data, he said, "This is what every single scientist does every day of their lives."
Marsden pointed out that Brown had advanced science while he was keeping his "Santa" object under observation.
He discovered that it has a moon, nicknamed Rudolph, allowing him to calculate the object's mass about one third that of Pluto.
Moreover, he did report it, said Marsden, citing the abstracts.
"I don't blame him for wanting to finish the job," Marsden said.
"You do the whole thing.
That is how astronomy is done, or used to be done."
Marsden, who is secretary of astronomical union's committee for naming small bodies, said that he would suggest to Brown that he propose names for both 2003 EL61 and its satellite.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Aug 2: When a Caltech astronomer, Michael Brown, announced last year that his team had found a distant object three fourths the size of Pluto orbiting the sun, he declined to call it a planet, and he even suggested that Pluto should not be considered a planet either.
There was, he said, just no good scientific rationale for considering either of those distant bodies in the same league as the eight indisputable planets that circle the sun at closer range.
Now Brown has found something orbiting the sun that's bigger than Pluto and even farther away.
He's changed his mind and proposed that Pluto keep its designation, and that the new object, an extremely big lump of ice and rock, should also be deemed a planet.
There was still no good scientific rationale for the judgment, he admitted, but this was a case where habit 75 years of calling Pluto a planet should trump any scientific definition.
There is no real debate that the four terrestrial planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars and the four gaseous giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune deserve their status as planets.
But scientists have long been uneasy about including Pluto, an icy ball, smaller than our moon, whose orbit is more eccentric than the others and tilts in a different plane.
Try as they might, scientists could not come up with a definition that would retain Pluto as a planet without requiring that scads of other objects be deemed planets as well.
Nor could they satisfy the legions of space enthusiasts who remain certain from their grade school lessons that there are nine planets no more, no less.
So now Brown proposes that scientists give up the battle and accept a cultural definition of what a planet is.
It's either the nine planets we learned about in grade school, or those nine plus any newfound object orbiting the sun that turns out to be bigger than Pluto.
He opts for the latter approach on the theory that most people, deep down, accept that definition.
This definition would also, of course, qualify Brown for the historical footnotes as the discoverer of a new planet.
Our own preference is to take a cleaner way out by dropping Pluto from the planetary ranks.
Scientists may well discover many more ice balls bigger than Pluto, and it's a safe bet that few in our culture want to memorize the names of 20 or more planets.
Far better to downgrade Pluto to the status of an icy sphere that was once mistakenly deemed a planet because we had not yet discovered its compatriots on the dark fringes of the solar system.
Scientists using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope have found that Pluto has not one, but three moons.
The discovery is likely to prompt searches for undiscovered moons elsewhere and shed light on the evolution of the Kuiper Belt, the vast icy region of space beyond Neptune where Pluto resides.
"Pluto just became even more interesting," said Hal Weaver, a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., and co leader of the team that made the discovery.
The newly discovered moons are constantly being pelted by objects in space, sending out debris that give Pluto an unusual appearance, researchers say.
"They should generate rings around Pluto," said Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., the other co leader.
But so far, no one has seen them.
The most distant planet from the sun, Pluto is only about 1475 miles in diameter, or two thirds the size of earth's moon so tiny that some scientists question whether it qualifies for planethood at all.
"It tells us that Pluto is a much more complex world than we previously imagined," Richard Binzel, a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said of the latest discovery.
"How do you get so many moons around such a small planet?"
Moons have been discovered orbiting every planet in the solar system except Venus and Mercury.
Jupiter, by far the largest planet, has 38 known moons.
Like earth's moon, most are believed to have formed when meteors or other space objects collided with the nearby planet, shooting debris into space that are gradually shaped by gravitational forces.
"It' the easiest way for a planet to get such a huge satellite," Binzel said.
Training Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys on Pluto on May 15 and again three days later, scientists found two very faint satellites moving in a counterclockwise orbit.
They were about 5000 times fainter than light from the planet itself.
The new moons are 30 to 100 miles in diameter and orbit about 30000 miles and 40000 miles away from Pluto, respectively.
The closer moon takes about 25 days to orbit, the more distant takes about 38 days.
Charon, the moon discovered in 1978, is 12000 miles from Pluto and orbits the planet once every 6.4 days.
The observations were confirmed by Hubble images taken on June 14, but they must be reconfirmed by the Hubble in February before the International Astronomical Union will consider names for the moons.
For now, they're known as P1 and P2.
Pluto itself was discovered in 1930 and named for the Roman god of the underworld.
Its orbit ranges from 2.7 billion miles to 4.6 billion miles from the sun.
Earth is 93 million miles from the sun.
Some astronomers say Pluto's small size, its highly elliptical orbit and methane ice surface make it more like a Kuiper Belt object and less like the outer gas giant planets, such as Jupiter and Neptune.
Scientists at New York's Hayden Planetarium caused an uproar when they put only eight planets in a display that opened in 2000 and classified Pluto as a Kuiper Belt object.
The debate intensified this summer with discovery of a Kuiper Belt object, UB313, that is larger than Pluto.
But experts say discovery of the moons may help Pluto keep its planetary status.
"It's going to be harder and harder not to call it a planet," said Stephen Maran, a retired astronomer from the Goddard Space Flight Center and author of the book "Astronomy for Dummies."
(Optional add end) The IAU has currently assigned a group of astronomers to develop criteria for planethood.
Stern, who is a member of the IAU group, said the discovery of the moons will likely add support to keeping Pluto a planet.
He also is principal investigator of New Horizons, an unmanned National Aeronautics and Space Administration mission designed to probe Pluto and the Kuiper Belt over the next 15 years.
Launch is scheduled for January.
"I think just on a visceral level, the fact that Pluto has a whole suite of companions, I think will make some people, in the public at least, feel better about its status," Stern said.
Cox News Service ATLANTA NASA is poised to begin its first mission to the last planet, a 4 billion mile, 9 year journey to the icy outback of the solar system.
The destination is Pluto, its moon Charon and then beyond, into vast unexplored region of the solar system known as the Kuiper Belt. over the plutonium power source the spacecraft carries the New Horizons Pluto probe could be launched as early as 1:24 p.m. Tuesday.
The launch window of about two hours a day extends through mid February.
The $700 million mission is the capstone to NASA's exploration of the planets than began with the Mariner 2 flyby of Venus in 1962.
As a sign of how times change, by the time the latest probe reaches its destination in 2015, Pluto may no longer be considered a planet.
Or if it is, it probably won't be the outermost.
The uncertainty is a tribute to how much more than four decades of planetary exploration has revealed about our solar system and how much remains to be discovered, especially out where no spacecraft has ventured before.
Not long ago, everyone knew how many planets there were.
There were, with the discovery of Pluto in 1930, exactly nine.
Generations of high school students earned their A's in science class with papier m?ch?
models of the solar system that included nine count 'em nine planets.
Lately, however, the situation has grown more complex.
To some, Pluto and Charon, discovered in 1978, are no longer planet and moon, but because they are so close to each other, so similar in size and both actually orbit a center of mass between them a binary planet system.
To make the once rigid order of the solar system even messier, astronomers have found more than 80 other bodies variously known as minor planets, planetoids, trans Neptunian objects or Kuiper Belt objects that lie near or beyond the ninth rock from the sun.
Pluto, in fact, because its erratic orbit sometimes take it inside the orbit of Neptune, is sometimes actually the eighth rock from the sun.
Scientists estimate that the Kuiper Belt, which stretches for more than a billion miles beyond Pluto, may hold thousands of such objects.
At least four of those already identified have their own moons.
And some may, like Pluto and Charon, be binary "planet" systems themselves.
As the census of the outer solar system has grown to include the likes of Orcus, Ixion, Quaoar and Buffy, some astronomers have suggested that Pluto, which is smaller than Earth's moon, is more like other Kuiper Belt objects than it is like other planets.
The picture got even more confusing last year with the reported discovery of 2003 UB313, an object some scientists are hailing as "the tenth planet," an object code named Xena.
It is larger than Pluto and more than three times farther from the sun.
And it too has its own moon.
So far, the International Astronomical Union, which has the say in such matters, hasn't revoked Pluto's planethood or conferred planet status on UB313.
By whatever name they are finally called, however, these outliers of the solar system are objects of intense scientific curiosity.
Pluto and the other icy bodies that swarm the Kuiper Belt are thought to be the leftovers from the birth of the solar system preserved in a cosmic deep freeze since Earth and the other planets coalesced 4.5 billion years ago.
"Exploring Pluto and Charon what lies beyond, is going to be like conducting an archaeological dig into the history of the outer solar system," says the mission's chief scientist, Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute's Department of Space Studies.
"And when this spacecraft gets there, we are going to be like kids in a candy shop."
These kids, however, are going to have to be patient.
Boosted into space by a powerful three stage rocket, the New Horizons spacecraft will be hurled into space faster than any man made object in history.
It will need all the speed it can muster.
If the spacecraft is launched Tuesday, it won't reach Pluto until July 2015.
Because of the changing position of the planets, a delay of even a few weeks could add years to the flight time.
Outbound at 36000 miles an hour, the spacecraft it will cover the distance to the moon in just nine hours a trip that took the Apollo astronauts three days.
By early 2007, it will be hurtling past Jupiter, using the giant planet's gravity to sling it even faster toward the outer solar system.
Like NASA's other deep space probes, the Pluto bound spacecraft gets its electrical power from a compact radioisotope thermoelectric generator, powered by the radioactive decay of plutonium.
Bruce Gagnon, of the Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power contends that a launch accident would scatter plutonium over a large area of central Florida.
He discounts the space agency's record of 24 successful launches with similar plutonium generators.
"One thing we have learned is that sooner or later, space technology can fail," he says.
The plutonium power source will provide 200 watts of power for the spacecraft about what it takes to light two standard light bulbs but that will be enough to operate all seven of its scientific instruments during the encounter with Pluto as well as to transmit pictures and data to Earth.
"Pluto is a treasure trove of scientific information just waiting to be discovered," says Andy Danzler, the director of NASA's Solar System Exploration Division.
The probe, which will come within 6000 miles of Pluto's icy surface will give scientists their best view ever of a body that until recently has never been more than a fuzzy blob of light.
From Earth, Pluto is 50000 times fainter than Mars.
Its atmosphere of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide is thousands of times less dense than Earth's.
And the temperature at the surface is a frigid 382 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
"Out Earth based observations are still too crude to tell us much about what we'll see when we finally get there," says Stern.
"We still don't know what we don't know about Pluto."
Discoveries about Pluto and its neighbors are likely to roll in during the ten years NASA's probe is en route.
Only last year, for instance, a survey using the Hubble Space Telescope found that Pluto and Charon have two other, smaller moons, currently named P1 and P2, making the system the New Horizons spacecraft is bound for even more complex that previously thought.
"Pluto has been a harbinger of the mysteries that await on the planetary frontier," says Danzler.
"In 1930, it offered a preview of the icy, rocky objects in what would become known as the Kuiper Belt.
"Pluto's new moons are just the latest in a spectacular series of discoveries made from and above the Earth."
And once Pluto is in the rearview mirror a decade from now, scientists hope to send the spacecraft on to visit at least two Kuiper Belt objects.
Although the craft's power diminishes with time, the generator could support a decade or more of exploration beyond Pluto.

There's plenty of gray hair on the heads of scientists leading the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's New Horizons mission to Pluto.
But they all vow they'll still be on the job when their unmanned spacecraft reaches the farthest planet from the sun in July 2015.
"Yes, we'll all be there," said Glen Fountain, 63, the mission's project manager at the Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory near Laurel, Md., where New Horizons was planned and built.
The team's pledge to stick with the job could become tougher to fulfill than they'd like.
The $700 million project is set to launch Jan 17 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida the first flight ever to Pluto and the longest mission ever planned, with the fastest spacecraft ever.
But so vast is the distance Pluto averages 3.7 billion miles from the sun, about 40 times farther than Earth that a four week delay in launch will cost the mission's silver haired captains five additional years, until 2020, before their work pays off.
An extended mission to regions beyond Pluto could add seven more years.
They're willing to wait.
As dark, cold and far away as it is, "Pluto is a treasure trove of scientific discoveries waiting to be uncovered," Andrew Dantzler, 43, director of NASA's solar system division, told reporters this week at NASA headquarters in Washington.
Pluto, named after the Roman god of the underworld, is unlike any other planet in the solar system, he said, and "as such, it holds many clues to how the solar system was formed, also perhaps how other systems formed."
Pluto was the last of the nine planets to be discovered in 1930 by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh.
It orbits the sun at distances ranging from 2.8 billion to 4.6 billion miles.
If Earth were in Baltimore, and Mars (at its closest) were 40 miles away in Washington, a spacecraft would have to fly 4000 miles to Geneva, Switzerland to reach Pluto.
Thanks to that distance and Pluto's tiny size, even the Hubble Space Telescope has managed only the crudest images of the planet's mottled surface.
Its largest moon, Charon, wasn't discovered until 1978.
Hubble scientists spotted two more moons only last May.
So planetary scientists are understandably impatient for a closer look at this oddball planet.
Smaller than Earth's moon, Pluto circles the sun once in 248 Earth years.
It is neither a rocky planet like Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, nor a gas giant like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
Instead, it's mostly rock, water, nitrogen, carbon monoxide and methane, all frozen at minus 387 degrees Fahrenheit.
In 1988, scientists discovered that some of Pluto's ices escape as gas to form a tenuous atmosphere that changes with the planet's seasons.
The mission's top scientist, Alan Stern, 48, of Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., described Pluto as "a scientific wonderland for atmospheric scientists."
Even so, planetary experts have long debated whether Pluto is even a planet.
In the 1950s, Dutch American astronomer Gerard Kuiper suggested Pluto might belong to a population of ice balls thought to orbit the sun beyond Neptune.
He theorized that the icy realm is the source of comets that periodically zip through the inner solar system.
Since 1992, astronomers have found more than 1000 of these objects, more than 5 billion miles from the sun, in what they now call the "Kuiper Belt."
They range in size from 30 to 1250 miles across.
Although some astronomers argue that Pluto isn't a planet but rather the king of the Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), Stern insists the big KBOs have now qualified as planets, like Pluto which would give our solar system far more than the nine planets identified in science textbooks.
They qualify, he said, because they're large enough for their own gravity to pull them into a spherical shape.
Scientists' fascination with Pluto and the KBOs is rooted in the notion that these objects are frozen keys to the solar system's formation 4.5 billion years ago.
That's why the National Academy of Science ranked a mission to Pluto, and the Kuiper Belt beyond, as the highest priority for U.S. space science in this decade.
The challenge for APL's designers was to build a spacecraft that could survive a 10 or 15 year journey through the coldest, darkest reaches of the solar system and arrive ready to work.
The first requirement was speed.
New Horizons weighs 1000 pounds, but it will be hurled toward Pluto by NASA's most powerful rocket, an Atlas V packing 2.4 million pounds of thrust.
So the craft will leave Earth's orbit at 36000 mph.
That's about 8 miles per second all it needs to reach Pluto.
At that speed, it will pass the moon's orbit in nine hours, a leap that took Apollo astronauts three days.
It will pass Jupiter in a little over a year, five years quicker than NASA's Galileo mission.
And mission managers hope to use the giant planet's gravity to boost New Horizons' speed to 47000 mph 10.5 miles per second.
Traveling too far from the sun to rely on solar energy for heat and electricity, New Horizons will be powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), which converts the heat from decaying plutonium 238 directly to electricity.
It's the same technology used on the Cassini mission to Saturn and 23 other U.S. space probes.
New Horizons also was built with minimal power demands less than two 100 watt bulbs for all its work at Pluto.
Its scientific instruments draw between 2 and 10 watts each, and they're packed inside a heat conservingThermos like container 2 feet by 7 feet by 9 feet in size.
To avoid years of wear and tear on the craft's systems, planners programmed it to hibernate through most of its voyage beyond Jupiter.
It will send home a weekly "I'm OK" tone, but awaken only once a year for 50 days of checkups, routine maintenance and course corrections.
The first test of New Horizons' suite of seven cameras, spectrometers and other scientific instruments will come as it passes Jupiter next winter, passing three times closer than Cassini's 2000 flyby en route to Saturn.
But the scientific focus is on Pluto and its moons.
Scientists hope to begin receiving pictures of Pluto five months before the spacecraft's closest approach.
Surface mapping will begin two months later, from a range of 60 million miles.
The biggest day for scientists will be when New Horizons flies past Pluto at a distance of 16800 miles.
Cameras and spectrometers will snap pictures of the planet and its moons, mapping details as small as 80 feet across 10000 times Hubble's resolution.
Instruments also will send back data on the composition, temperature and atmosphere of the Plutonian system.
Because of the huge volume of information and slow download rates at that vast distance, it will take nine months to transmit all the data back to Earth.
After the Pluto encounter, if NASA provides the money, mission planners want to send the spacecraft deep into the Kuiper Belt, to explore at least two other KBOs during the next five to seven years, promising more discoveries even if some of the original team members have moved on or retired.
In my daughter's circle of friends, one 3 year old named Jared can reel off the names of all the planets.
He and his parents are pretty proud, justly in my estimation, of this achievement.
Little does he know, however, that the lords of astronomy are working against him.
For the last 18 months, a committee appointed by the International Astronomical Union has been pondering in frustrating exactitude whether the word "planet" means anything anymore.
Last month Nature reported that the committee was ready to propose dumping the bare term "planet" in favor of an expanded, more embellished set of terms like "terrestrial planets," "trans Neptunian planets" and so forth.
But that turned out to be a false alarm, according to the committee's chairman, Iwan Williams of Queen Mary College in London.
He said in an e mail message that although a majority favored the redefinition, many other ideas were blooming and contending so fractiously that he despaired of ever reaching general agreement.
Williams said, "Up to this point I have been hoping for a consensus, but I guess we might need to go for a majority vote."
The solar system is much more complicated now, astronomers say, than in 1930, when Clyde Tombaugh added Pluto to the inventory of wandering lights circling the sun.
In addition to Earth, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Neptune, Uranus and Pluto, schoolchildren now learn that there are also comets and asteroids bumping about in the night.
But there are also the Oort cloud, a hypothesized halo of cometary bits hibernating in deep, deep space, and the Kuiper Belt, a ring of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit.
Not mention the dozens of moons circling the planets.
Pluto is the big problem.
Is it a planet or not?
Some astronomers have long argued that its small size, less than one fifth the diameter of Earth, and a weird tilted orbit that takes it inside Neptune every couple of hundred years make Pluto more like a Kuiper Belt body than a full fledged planet.
A furor arose five years ago when my colleague Kenneth Chang reported that the new Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History in New York had demoted Pluto, calling it a "Kuiper Belt object" rather than a planet.
The controversy became more desperate this summer when astronomers discovered a new object larger than Pluto orbiting in the Kuiper Belt at a distance of 9 billion miles from the sun.
Michael E. Brown of the California Institute of Technology, its discoverer, has said it will be fine with him if Pluto is demoted to a minor planet, but, he argues, if Pluto is a planet, so is the new object, which he nicknamed Xena, making it the 10th planet.
Last Friday Brown announced that Xena has a tiny moon, making it seem even more planetlike.
Brian Marsden, an astronomer at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, directs the astronomical union's Minor Planet Center, a clearinghouse for solar system discoveries.
Marsden says he thinks that both Pluto and Brown's Xena should be called minor planets.
He is one of those who support the idea of categorizing planets into groups.
But according to Williams, other members of the panel have championed other ideas.
For example, some say that planets should be larger than 2000 kilometers (or about 1250 miles) in diameter (Pluto's diameter is about 1500 miles).
Neil DeGrasse Tyson, of the Rose Center, who is not a member of the astronomical union committee, said the proposed naming scheme sounded a lot like the museum's system.
He said, however, that the need to assign adjectives to the word "planet" might mean it was time to retire the term altogether.
Asked what he would replace it with, Tyson said he hoped the geologists could come up with something and offered up words like "terrestrials," for balls of dirt and rock like Earth, "Jovians," for giant gaseous planets like Jupiter and Saturn, comets, and so forth.
The panel members disagree on more than just the definition of a planet.
At last report they could not even agree, it seemed, on whether they were making progress.
Within the space of a few minutes the other week, I received one e mail message from Marsden saying he was optimistic and another from Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Washington complaining that his morning e mail gave him no sense that they were near bringing the issue to a close.
In another e mail message, Boss described the process as "like trying to shovel frogs into a wheelbarrow they keep jumping out again."
The new object, now known poetically as 2003 UB313, is destined to languish nameless until the astronomical union panel comes to a conclusion and thus decides which part of the astronomical bureaucracy is responsible for major planets or minor planets and will have to approve a new name.
"Every time it looks as though we might be approaching a consensus, rather severe disagreement has a way of breaking out again," Marsden said.
"It is all very unfortunate."
Even the idea that a majority of the committee was leaning anywhere was hotly disputed by S. Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., who is the principal investigator of a coming National Aeronautics and Space Administration mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt.
Stern has suggested that the criterion of planethood be roundness a body big enough for gravity to have conquered geological and mechanical forces.
That would include in the roll call of planets not only Pluto, but dozens of objects he thinks are yet to be discovered out in the Kuiper Belt.
"I think it'll be obvious very shortly that dwarf planets surely outnumber the planets our fathers' generation thought of as the mainstream," Stern said.
If it should turn out in the years to come that Earth is not actually a very good example of a planet, that would not be the first instance in which astronomers have painted themselves into a corner, linguistically.
Being limited to looking in the practice of their science, astronomers tend to characterize and classify new phenomena by their appearances their colors, for example.
Objects that resemble one another then get lumped together under the name of their progenitor until enough differences accumulate to start a new category.
So it was that a starlike object known as BL Lacertae, the progenitor of a kind of exploding galaxy, was eventually said to not be a good example of a BL Lacertae object.
Astronomers are not alone in having a silly name problem, but they may be alone in agonizing so much about it.
Physicists have shown little restraint in creating names like neutrinos, quarks, squarks, gluons, photinos, selectrons, strangeness and charm, not to mention strings and branes.
No commission regulates what physicists call things.
"Basically physicists are too undisciplined to let anyone else tell us what to name something," said Gordon Kane of the University of Michigan.
"It's mainly whatever name catches on."
Williams of the astronomical union said there was no deadline for his committee's decision on planetary nomenclature.
The urgency, he said, comes from the need to find a way of giving Brown's Xena an official name.
Early this week Williams circulated a new proposal, defining anything with a radius of more than 1000 kilometers (roughly that of Pluto) as a planet, asking for a vote within two weeks.
So far there are no indications of a groundswell.
Boss, of the Carnegie Institution, who hopes that the adjective planet compromise will catch on in astronomy, said he thought the public would be "thrilled" to realize that astronomy had progressed so far as to require a re sorting of the primary components of the solar system.
"Science marches on," he said, "and this brouhaha is a sterling reminder of both the joy and the pain of this process."
I cannot argue with his logic and his desire for clarity.
But at the risk of being a curmudgeon, and in the interest of 3 year olds everywhere who are reaching for a basic comprehension of how the universe is put together and where they stand, I think the astronomers should take a page from the lawyers and jurists we're hearing so much from these days.
I think they should adopt "stare decisis," Latin for "stand by that decided."
By precedent Pluto is a planet.
If we agree on that, then we can look forward to many more planets.
There were smiles all around the office here when the putative 10th planet was announced last July.
There is something ennobling and hopeful about living at a time when a 10th planet is added to the solar system, and maybe an 11th and 12th as planned surveys of the trans Neptunian void are carried out.
It is like being young again and finding out your family is larger than you thought.
It is like living in an expanding universe.
So what, exactly, is a planet?
Astronomers have been deadlocked over this for years, but a decision may finally be forthcoming, because a thing they discovered last year in the solar system's outer reaches has turned out to be bigger than Pluto.
So if Pluto hangs on to its status by no means a slam dunk then the fetchingly named 2003 UB313, which is about 30 percent fatter, probably would have to be a planet, too.
The 10th.
But if Pluto gets demoted, the solar system will have just eight.
Either way, textbooks that refer to nine planets are doomed to obsolescence.
"It's only fair," said astronomer Frank Bertoldi of Germany's University of Bonn.
"It's my view that Pluto for historical reasons should remain a planet otherwise school kids will be confused.
Any object that's bigger than Pluto should also be a planet."
Bertoldi, reporting Thursday in the journal Nature, led a research team that measured surface temperatures of 2003 UB313 to confirm that this "ice dwarf," more than 9 billion miles from the sun at its farthest point, is about 1800 miles in diameter, whereas Pluto's diameter is about 1380 miles.
Neither one is "big."
Earth's moon is 2160 miles across.
Astronomers had suspected that 2003 UB313 was at least as big as Pluto and probably bigger when its discoverers measured its brightness last summer.
Any object that far away could not be as bright as it was and still be smaller than Pluto.
"But they didn't know how big it was, or whether it could have been as big as Mercury," said Carnegie Institute of Washington astronomer Scott Sheppard, author of an article accompanying the Nature paper.
To pin down 2003 UB313's size, astronomers needed to know not only its brightness but also its "reflectivity" how much of the sunlight illuminating the distant body was bouncing off its surface.
"A small body with high reflectivity can be as bright as a large body with low reflectivity," Sheppard said.
Brightness in the visible spectrum is a function of both the reflectivity of the body and its "size" expressed as the area illuminated by the sun.
To determine reflectivity, Bertoldi's team used a radio telescope in the mountains of southern Spain to examine 2003 UB313 in thermal wavelengths close to infrared and not visible to the naked eye.
There its "heat signature" could be measured and subtracted from the total sunlight that reached it.
The difference was the reflectivity.
"We took two measurements and got a consistent solution," Bertoldi said in a telephone interview.
"We've done this many times over the years, and it's a very secure way of measuring the size of an object" when the object is either too small or too far away to be analyzed easily by a traditional optical telescope.
A team of researchers led by the California Institute of Technology's Michael Brown reported the discovery of 2003 UB313 last summer.
It was the most distant object ever seen in the solar system, a chill sphere cloaked in water and methane ice, and circling the sun in a highly eccentric orbit 44 degrees off the plane where most of the planets dwell.
Brown nicknamed the new discovery "Lila," after his baby daughter, but permanent naming awaits a decision by the International Astronomical Union, which is also trying to decide how to define a planet.
This, it appears, is heavy going.
One school agrees with Bertoldi that the Pluto tradition should be upheld, but another suggests that Pluto, 2003 UB313 and other icy denizens of the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune are not planets but "objects."
There is no clear leader in the debate.
"Until they decide whether it's a planet or not, we don't know how to name it," Brown said in a telephone interview.
"This could go on for years."
They're so far away, yet somehow so close.
The planets make their appointed rounds at distances measured in millions or billions of miles, yet their personal magnetism, so to speak, and the visible presence of beloved orbs like Venus and Mars, make them feel almost like family all part of the same happy solar system.
And what a collection of personalities they turn out to be in Dava Sobel's warm, whimsical portrait album of the nine planets, with the moon thrown in for good measure.
Sobel, the author of "Longitude" and "Galileo's Daughter," has aimed "The Planets" squarely at a mass audience receptive to the romance of the heavens, ready to have its mind boggled by weird and wonderful facts, and eager to coo and trill over verbal baby pictures of peppy little Mercury and seductive Venus.
"The Planets" has a little something for everyone.
Myth, poetry, science fiction, geology, mineralogy, cosmology, and even etymology find their way into Sobel's almost fablelike narratives, which, if you remove a few technical terms, could make splendid bedtime read aloud material.
Each planet has a personality, a face, and a rich inner life.
Sobel excels at evoking the saturated colors, the strange weather, and the eerie atmosphere of the planets.
Gassy Jupiter, with no solid surface or terrain, is nothing but weather, unchanged by seasons because the planet sits upright on its axis.
"Every identifiable feature resolves into a cloud bank, a cyclone, a jet stream, a thunderbolt, or a curtain of auroral lights," Sobel writes.
"On Jupiter, a storm may continue for centuries, innocent of landfall."
Even Sobel's orbits take on a poetic quality.
Mercury races around the Sun much faster than it spins.
It takes six weeks to get from sunup to high noon, but only 88 days to complete a journey around the sun.
"Thus," Sobel writes, "the years hurry by, while the days drag on forever."
Among many other things, Mercury is the god of commerce, reflected in words like "merchant" and "mercantile."
"The Planets" is a grab bag of fascinating facts like these.
Because the thick carbon dioxide clouds that swathe Venus allow only red light to penetrate, "the landscape presents itself as a monochrome in the sepia tones of old photographs."
Seismologists can actually hear Earth's iron nickel core turning inside the still molten outer core, at a speed almost one second a day faster than the rest of the planet.
When spring arrives on Mars, white frost disappears, as if by magic, back into the carbon dioxide atmosphere whence it came, without pausing to melt.
The gee whiz factor looms large, in other words.
But along the way Sobel manages to sneak in a coherent account of how each planet was discovered and named, how it moves in the solar system, and what puzzles remain for scientists to solve.
She does not shy away from terms like "magnetosphere" or "regolith."
But she makes sure to translate numbers and physical data into images that seize the imagination.
To imagine the almost unimaginable flatness of the rings of Saturn, whose average depth is roughly equivalent to a 30 story building, picture a sheet of tissue paper the size of a football field.
Sobel occasionally overplays her hand.
She tells the story of Mars in the first person, assuming the role of Allan Hills 84001, a Martian meteorite discovered near the South Pole in 1984.
This is twee.
Sobel, in a brief preface recalling her earliest infatuation with the planets, describes a class play in which a student twirling two Hula Hoops played Saturn and she appeared as the Lonely Planet.
The talking Mars rock belongs in that play.
Also annoying is the dual chapter on Uranus and Neptune, which takes the form of an imaginary letter from Caroline Lucretia Herschel, the sister of the astronomer William Herschel, to the American astronomer Maria Mitchell.
As an exercise in Victorian prose style, it rates a B. As a strain on the reader's patience, it flies right off the charts.
What about Pluto, that little scamp at the far end of the solar system?
It's a problem.
It achieved planetary status when astronomers sensed a certain something pulling at Uranus and Neptune.
Originally, it was assumed that Planet X was 10 times Earth's mass.
Since being discovered in 1930, Pluto has had its size downgraded drastically, to the specklike dimensions it has today, about 1500 miles in diameter and a mass only two thousandths of Earth's.
Then, in 1989, Voyager 2 erased Pluto's reason for being.
It found that Neptune and Uranus actually balanced each other's orbital anomalies, and there was no need to posit a ninth planet.
Sobel comes up with a happy ending.
In the 1990s, astronomers discovered all sorts of Pluto like bodies in the Kuiper Belt, a doughnut shaped zone that extends outward from Neptune to a distance 50 times greater than the distance from the Earth to the sun.
So things are looking up for Pluto, which may have its best days ahead of it, not the last planet, perhaps, but as "the first citizen of a distant teeming shore."

Pluto has three moons, not one, new images from the Hubble Space Telescope suggest.
Pluto, discovered as the ninth planet in 1930, was thought to be alone until its moon Charon was spotted in 1978.
The new moons, more than twice as far away as Charon and many times fainter, were spotted by Hubble in May.
While the observations have to be confirmed, members of the team that discovered the satellites said Monday they felt confident about their data.
"Pluto and Charon are not alone, they have two neighbors," said Hal Weaver of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.
Follow up observations by the Hubble are planned in February.
If they are confirmed, the International Astronomical Union will consider names for the objects.
Earlier this month another group of astronomers, who claim to have discovered the 10th planet in the solar system, also said that body had a moon.
(Whether the group actually discovered a new planet has not been confirmed.)
Both Pluto and the new, so called planet are found in the Kuiper Belt, a disc of icy bodies beyond Neptune.
In fact, about a fifth of the objects observed in the region have been found to have satellites, and the percentage could grow as more are found, said Keith Noll, an astronomer at the Baltimore based Space Telescope Science Institute.
The institute coordinates use of the orbiting telescope, but Noll wasn't part of the Pluto team.
He believes Pluto team's finding is convincing.
Weaver said Pluto would be the first Kuiper belt object found to have multiple satellites.
Depending on how reflective the surface of the moons are, the newly found moons are estimated to be between 30 and 100 miles across, he said.
Further observations of Pluto and the two new bodies will help astronomers more accurately determine the mass and density of Pluto and its large moon Charon, said team member Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado.
The jury is still out on the impact additional moons will have on the ongoing debate over whether Pluto is actually a planet.
While having a moon is a not a criteria Mercury and Venus are moonless having more can't hurt, Stern said.
"Just on a visceral level, the fact that Pluto has a whole suite of companions will make some people feel better," Stern said.
The fastest spacecraft ever launched began the first full day of its 3 billion mile journey to Pluto, where it will study the last unexplored planet and the mysterious icy area that surrounds it.
The New Horizons spacecraft blasted off aboard an Atlas V rocket Thursday afternoon in a spectacular start to the US$700 million mission.
Despite the speed it can reach 36000 mph (58000 kph) it will take 9 1/2 years to reach Pluto and the frozen, sunless reaches of the solar system.
"It looked beautiful," said Ralph McNutt Jr. of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, one of the mission's scientists.
"I was getting a little bit antsy."
The 1054 pound (480 kilogram) spacecraft was loaded with seven instruments that will photograph the surfaces of Pluto and its large moon, Charon, and analyze Pluto's atmosphere.
Two of the cameras, Alice and Ralph, are named for the bickering couple from TV's "The Honeymooners."
New Horizons also contained some of the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh, the astronomer who discovered Pluto in 1930.
His widow, Patricia Tombaugh, was in tears as she watched the launch.
"It was so beautiful and we've waited so long," said Tombaugh, 93, of Las Cruces, New Mexico.
NASA had postponed the liftoff two straight days because of wind gusts at the launch pad and a power outage at the spacecraft's control center in Maryland.
Pluto is the solar system's most distant planet and the brightest body in a zone known as the Kuiper Belt, which is made up of thousands of icy, rocky objects, including tiny planets whose development was stunted for unknown reasons.
Scientists believe studying those "planetary embryos" can help them understand how planets were formed.
Some astronomers question whether Pluto is technically a planet.
Pluto is a celestial oddball an icy dwarf unlike the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars and the gaseous planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
"We're realizing just how much there is to the deep, outer solar system," said Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator.
"I think it's exciting that textbooks have to be rewritten, over and over."
Because it was launched in January, the spacecraft will be able to use Jupiter's gravity as a sling to shave five years off the trip, allowing it to arrive as early as July 2015.
The probe, powered by 24 pounds (11 kilograms) of plutonium, will not land on Pluto but will photograph it, analyze its atmosphere and send data back across the solar system to Earth.
The launch went off without incident, to the relief of anti nuclear activists who had feared an accident could scatter lethal radioactive material.
The probe will rely on the natural decay of the plutonium to generate electricity for its instruments.
NASA and the Energy Department had put the chances of a launch accident that could release radiation at 1 in 350.
As a precaution, the agencies brought in 16 mobile field teams that can detect radiation and 33 air samplers and monitors.
NASA administrator Michael Griffin said he had an answer for those who may question spending so much on the mission to a place in space too far away to observe in any detail from Earth.
"Of what value do you think it might be to be able to study the primordial constituents from which the solar system and all the planets and we, ourselves, were formed?"
Griffin said.
A ball of ice and dust discovered last year in the outskirts of the solar system is 30 percent wider than Pluto, a team of German astronomers is reporting Thursday.
The finding definitively makes the icy ball temporarily labeled 2003 UB313 and nicknamed Xena the largest known object to be discovered orbiting Earth's sun since Neptune was identified in 1846, and adds to the debate over what should be considered a planet.
The diameter of 2003 UB313, the astronomers found, is 1860 miles, give or take 250 miles.
Like Pluto, which has a diameter of 1400 miles, 2003 UB313 is a member of the Kuiper Belt, a ring of icy debris that orbits beyond Neptune.
"This is the first measurement of the size," said Frank Bertoldi, a professor of astronomy at the University of Bonn and the lead author of an article that appears in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
When the discovery of 2003 UB313 was announced in July 2005, astronomers knew that it was almost certainly larger than Pluto, because it appears surprisingly bright in the sky, even though it is 9 billion miles from the Sun, or about three times as far as Pluto.
Even if it had a perfectly reflective surface, 2003 UB313 would have to have the surface area of Pluto to achieve that brightness.
If the surface turned out to be dark, reflecting only a small fraction of sunlight, 2003 UB313 could conceivably have been the size of Mercury, the next in size with a diameter of 3000 miles.
To determine how large the object is, Bertoldi and colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy measured the heat emanating from it.
That enabled them to calculate a surface temperature of about minus 418 degrees Fahrenheit.
Combined with the previous optical observations, the data led to the finding that 2003 UB313 reflects about 60 percent of the light that hits it, a reflectivity similar to that of Pluto.
That, in turn, allowed the scientists to calculate the diameter at 1860 miles.
The similarities between 2003 UB313 and Pluto extend beyond size and reflectivity.
Like Pluto, 2003 UB313 also has a moon and has methane ice on its surface.
The discovery of 2003 UB313 has intensified a debate over the definition of a planet, which has swirled about Pluto since the late 1990s.
Pluto is by far the smallest of the nine planets, and 2003 UB313, while larger than Pluto, is still smaller than Earth's moon.
According to one definition, a planet has to gravitationally dominate its surroundings.
That would exclude both Pluto and 2003 UB313.
Some astronomers contend that any object in the solar system large enough that gravity has shaped it into a sphere should be called a planet.
But that would also add quite a few asteroids and other Kuiper Belt objects.
Another possibility is to arbitrarily call anything larger than Pluto a planet.
The debate has kept astronomers from bestowing a formal, more memorable name for 2003 UB313.
If planet status is bestowed, 2003 UB313 will probably be named after a Roman or Greek deity, like the other planets except Earth.
"There is still a stalemate on the meaning of 'planet,"' said Brian G. Marsden, director of the Minor Planet Center of the International Astronomical Union, "and no progress on providing a name for 2003 UB313."
Michael E. Brown of the California Institute of Technology, who discovered 2003 UB313, nicknamed it Xena, after the title character of the television series "Xena: Warrior Princess."
(When he later discovered a small moon around 2003 UB313, Brown nicknamed the moon Gabrielle, the name of Xena's sidekick in the series.)
Brown has a formal name for 2003 UB313, but he has not revealed it publicly.
Bertoldi said he preferred to keep Pluto as a planet and to bestow planethood on 2003 UB313.
"As a personal opinion, I don't want to downgrade Pluto as not a planet," he said.
"It would be impolite."
Pluto, the smallest and most distant planet of the solar system, may have three moons instead of just one, according to images NASA said were taken by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope.
Astronomers from the Southwest Research Institute reported observing the moons in May as they described near circular orbits around the icy planet in three days, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said.
If the discovery is confirmed by the International Astronomical Union, the two new moons will be named after characters in Greek and Roman mythology and take their side along Charon, Pluto's moon discovered in 1978.
For the time being, the two tiny satellites have been named S/2005 P1 and S/2005 P2.
They have eluded detection so long because they are 5000 times dimmer than Pluto.
The two moons in waiting were observed to be approximately 44000 kilometers (27000 miles) and 53000 kilometers (44000 miles) away from Pluto two or three times as far from the planet as Charon.
Compared to Charon's 1200 kilometer (745 mile) diameter, the two new moons are pint sized: just 32 kilometers (20 miles) and 70 kilometers (43 miles) across, respectively.
Pluto was discovered in 1930 at a distance of some 6.4 billion kilometers (three billion miles) from the sun in the heart of the Kuiper Belt a zone beyond Neptune 4.5 7.5 billion kilometers (2.8 4.6 billion miles) from the sun.
The Kuiper Belt is estimated to include more than 35000 objects of more than 100 kilomters (65 miles) in diameter: the remnants of the sun's accretion ring of matter from which all the planets were formed.
"If, as our new Hubble images indicate, Pluto has not one, but two or three moons, it will become the first body in the Kuiper Belt known to have more than one satellite," said astrophysicist Hal Weaver, of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, in Laurel, Maryland, and a co leader of the team that made the discovery.
The discoveries were made as the team prepared a NASA robotic mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt to be launched early next year.
Pluto, with its relatively small diameter of 2252 kilometers (1400 miles) is not considered a real planet by many astronomers.
Federal prosecutors Friday recommended that former Rep Randall "Duke" Cunningham serve the maximum 10 years in prison for what they called "unparalleled corruption" and "naked avarice" in seeking and taking $2.4 million in bribes.
U.S. Attorney Carol Lam and Assistant U.S.
Attorneys Sanjay Bhandari, Jason Forge and Phillip Halpern also recommended that Cunningham, who resigned in November after pleading guilty to bribery and tax evasion, be ordered to pay $1.5 million in taxes and penalties and forfeit $1.85 million in bribe money and items provided to him by four alleged co conspirators.
The 29 page document blisters Cunningham for arranging and overseeing a "lengthy and widespread bribery" scheme and even providing co conspirators with a "bribe menu" detailing how much money he required to provide a certain dollar amount in federal contracts.
Cunningham, 63, a Vietnam War hero and conservative Republican who was in his eighth term when he resigned, is set to be sentenced March 3.
Cunningham's attorney, K. Lee Blalack, said that "for a man of Duke's age and medical condition, such punishment would likely be a death sentence."
Cunningham has undergone surgery for prostate cancer.
"Duke devoted most of his life to serving this nation honorably in times of war and peace," Blalack said.
"If such a man doesn't deserve mercy, no one does."
Blalack submitted letters from former Navy pilots, San Diego religious leaders and Peter Yarrow of folk music group Peter, Paul and Mary attesting to Cunningham's good character.
Yarrow wrote that he and Cunningham are "polar opposites politically" but joined together in issues involving children's health.
The prosecutors' document portrays Cunningham as aggressively demanding bribes from defense contractors and people linked to them in exchange for using his position on congressional committees to help them.
Prosecutors do not detail exactly how much help or what contracts Cunningham may have steered toward the four co conspirators.
They said such information cannot be made public because the four are still being investigated, although they offered to make it available to the judge under seal.
A federal judge sentenced disgraced ex congressman Randall "Duke" Cunningham on Friday to eight years and four months in prison for taking bribes and evading taxes, considered the harshest penalty delivered to a former member of Congress in a corruption case.
"What you did was aggravated in scope, duration and nature," U.S. District Court Judge Larry Alan Burns told a haggard looking Cunningham.
"The word 'avarice' is an antiquated word.
But I think it applies here."
Cunningham had admitted taking $2.4 million in bribes from defense contractors and evading more than $1 million in taxes.
On Friday, with his voice breaking, the former decorated naval pilot asked the federal judge for mercy and mentioned his record as a war hero.
Burns said he would have sentenced the 64 year old Republican to 10 years in prison, as requested by prosecutors, but concluded that a measure of leniency was appropriate because of Cunningham's service in Vietnam.
After hearing arguments from prosecutors and defense attorneys, Burns said he agreed with the prosecution that a long sentence would send a warning to future politicians not to misuse their offices for private gain.
But he then said, "Yes, send a message to politicians, but another message should be sent for service to country."
Under a plea agreement reached in November, prosecutors agreed not to seek more than a 10 year sentence.
They could have pressed for 20 years.
Cunningham's attorneys had recommended a six year sentence, citing Cunningham's war record, age, declining health and lack of a criminal record.
Federal prisoners are generally eligible for parole after serving 85 percent of their sentences, or seven years and one month for Cunningham.
Burns also ordered Cunningham to pay $1.8 million in restitution and rejected his request to remain free long enough to say goodbye to his 91 year old mother and his estranged wife.
The judge ordered Cunningham into custody and recommended that he be sent to the minimum security prison in Taft, about 30 miles southwest of Bakersfield.
The federal Bureau of Prisons will decide where Cunningham will serve his time.
In a bid for a lesser sentence, Cunningham told the judge about his war record.
He shot down five enemy planes three on one day and received the Navy Cross, the Navy's second highest medal for bravery.
"I didn't jump into a pack of MiGs for ego," he said in a trembling voice, looking at prosecutors.
"I did it because it was the right thing to do."
Prosecutors had urged Burns to ignore Cunningham's war record, saying his heroism was "three decades ago."
But Burns noted that, while he himself had a high draft number and avoided military service during "an unpopular war," Cunningham had volunteered and served with distinction in combat and later as a flight instructor at the Top Gun school in San Diego.
Cunningham was accompanied into court by Rep Duncan Hunter, R Calif., a friend and a fellow Vietnam veteran.
Prosecutors called the sentence the longest ever handed down in a congressional corruption case and historians said the bribe was the largest.
"No one can serve the public and his own greed at the same time," U.S. Attorney Carol Lam said in a statement.
"Mr Cunningham failed his office, his colleagues and his nation."
The plea agreement, which forced Cunningham to resign, provided a detailed list of payoffs, including cash, sweetheart real estate deals, antiques, trips, use of a yacht, a deal on a Rolls Royce and jewelry for his wife.
The bribes from four unnamed co conspirators came in exchange for Cunningham using his influence to arrange lucrative defense contracts for high tech equipment for intelligence gathering and analysis.
Prosecutors portrayed Cunningham as the mastermind of the bribery scheme, noting that he kept a "bribe menu" on congressional stationery indicating how much he demanded in exchange for contracts.
They charged that he "bullied and hectored" Pentagon bureaucrats to approve deals for contractors Mitchell Wade and Brent Wilkes, including threatening to get one bureaucrat fired and ignoring a warning from one official that $700000 in bills from Wilkes' company seemed fraudulent.
Cunningham's fall from prominence was swift.
He represented a Republican district in the affluent suburbs of Northern San Diego County, had never encountered a close re election race and was a key GOP fundraiser.
But in June, the Copley News Service's Washington bureau reported that Wade had paid what appeared to be an inflated price for Cunningham's home in Del Mar Heights.
The sale allowed Cunningham and his wife, Nancy, to buy a mansion in swank Rancho Santa Fe.
Three months before the story broke, Cunningham's chief of staff in Washington had abruptly, but quietly, quit.
The aide had recognized the sale price of the house as a bribe and a year earlier had advised Cunningham to resign or at least not run for re election, a warning that Cunningham angrily ignored, according to federal prosecutors.
He was re elected in November 2004 to an eighth term.
Once the article appeared, federal prosecutors launched an investigation.
Wade, the contractor who bought the Del Mar Heights house, pleaded guilty last month to bribery and awaits sentencing in Washington federal court.
His amount of the bribes including a price that was $700000 above market value for the Del Mar Heights house was put at more than $1 million.
(Begin optional trim) Cunningham was elected in 1990 on the strength of his status as a war hero and the ethical problems of the Democratic incumbent, who had been scolded by colleagues for sexually harassing staff members.
He took office just as the United States launched the Persian Gulf War to push Saddam Hussein's army out of Kuwait.
As a decorated fighter pilot from the Vietnam War, Cunningham was sought after by the media, giving him a celebrity that few freshmen congressmen enjoy.
(End optional trim) Cunningham's wife, a school administrator, stood beside him in the summer when he denied the allegations.
The couple are now estranged.
Prosecutors decline to say whether she may face criminal charges.
The Rancho Santa Fe home has been sold for $2.6 million and Cunningham's share of the profits seized by the government.
An auction is set for March 23 for the antiques, rugs and other items, with the money to be confiscated by the Internal Revenue Service.
Not that it will matter all that much to him, but I accept the sincerity of Randall Harold Cunningham, aka Randy "Duke" Cunningham, R Calif., late of the U.S. House of Representatives, as he stood outside the federal courthouse in San Diego this week and tearfully acknowledged that he had done some pretty slimy deeds, which, if the wheels of justice grind exceedingly fine as expected, will have him adorned in a prison jumpsuit breaking big rocks into little rocks for a long, long time.
But what I am still unable to fully comprehend is the sheer magnitude of the man's audacity when he was riding high in the House.
Residents of the District of Columbia and even those in environs beyond may appreciate that of which I speak after learning about the event that transpired on Sept 25, 2001.
On that date Cunningham took chutzpah to heights unknown to humankind.
Scene: The floor of the House.
Matter under consideration: The fiscal 2002 D.C. appropriations act. Speaker: Randy "Duke" Cunningham.
The California Republican was explaining to the assembled legislators why, after eight years on the D.C. appropriations subcommittee, he had volunteered to stay there.
He said he had joined the subcommittee at the time of D.C. Mayor Marion Barry ( "Berry," according to the Congressional Record.)
Said Cunningham: "I thought what better place can we make some changes."
Don't you dare laugh.
Cunningham then proceeded to touch on an area of city life that caused him much unhappiness when he first joined the subcommittee.
Leasing arrangements for boat slips on the city's Southwest waterfront were, he said, his chief concern.
Then he laid this whopper on the House: "The City Council at that time was taking money under the table to support leases."
Now, let us pause.
The Washington Post, the record will show, has chronicled over the years an agglomeration of scandals involving officials of high and low estate in the city government.
But city council members taking money under the table to support leases on the Southwest wharf was, I thought at the time, a new one.
It was also news to our research department, which, at my request, conducted a search for such stories.
I also discussed Cunningham's revelation with council Chairman Linda Cropp and the city's first elected council chairman, Sterling Tucker.
They were also stumped by his charge.
I turned to Cunningham's office for evidence at the time, too.
His staff was no help.
I asked to speak with Cunningham, but he was unavailable.
I left a message explaining my request.
Cunningham never called back.
His non response is not, however, the reason that his charge against the council is in retrospect an unrivaled example of gall.
Consider this: When Duke Cunningham took to the House floor to denounce a past city council as crooked, he was at that very moment well into corruptly seeking and receiving bribes from two co conspirators in return for being influenced in the performance of his official duties.
His criminal acts are spelled out in the plea agreement Cunningham signed with federal prosecutors.
In fact, Cunningham the Corrupt, according to his plea agreement, had embarked upon his life of crime at least a year before he took to the House floor to malign Washington D.C.'s legislators.
In truth, congressional characters such as Cunningham have their way with the city.
They can get away with saying or doing anything.
Listen, for example, to Cunningham's reference to former D.C. mayor Barry during a D.C. appropriations subcommittee hearing two years ago: Cunningham: "The other area that I worked on was the education facility, all the way back from Marion Berry (sic) where most of the money went up his nose instead of toward the education system."
Yuck, yuck.
Listen also to Cunningham, in the same public hearing, shamelessly put the arm on a local economic development witness: Cunningham: "My brother was the President of the Chamber of Commerce in St.
Peters, Missouri, right outside of St. Louis.
He's looking for a job here in D.C., so if you've got an opening in the Chamber, I'll give you his resume."
D.C. Witness: "It would be great, Mr Chairman (sic).
We'd be glad to advance that."
Cunningham: "He also ran the seeder program in Texas, so he's got a lot of experience."
Cunningham used his perch on the D.C. appropriations subcommittee to habitually badger the mayor and city officials to improve the Southwest waterfront and the area of the Washington Marina where he lived rent free on a 42 foot yacht named "Duke Stir" that a co conspirator bought in 2002 and reportedly moved to Cunningham's slip for his personal use.
And city officials responded to him as if he were lord and master.
Defy Cunningham?
As a member of the Appropriations Committee, he had a hand on the city's purse strings.
He had more say over how D.C. raised taxes were spent than did D.C. taxpayers themselves.
Despite pocketing bribes under the table, Cunningham could still maliciously and falsely slam D.C. lawmakers from the vantage point of his congressional glass house, secure in the knowledge that no city official would dare toss a stone.
The San Diego Union Tribune started the chain of reports that brought him down.
Were it not for that, the Duke might still be here in Washington, lording it over D.C. leaders, accusing them of greed and a piggishness that he practiced with unfettered abandon himself.
Former congressman Randy "Duke" Cunningham, R Calif., wore a listening device as part of his cooperation with federal prosecutors before pleading guilty to taking $2.4 million in bribes in November, Time magazine reported Friday.
Time said that it is unclear who might have been targeted for electronic monitoring by Cunningham but that the topic "is the source of furious and nervous speculation by congressional Republicans."
The magazine, citing unidentified sources, said the recording took place "at some point during the short interval" between Cunningham's agreement to cooperate with prosecutors and his Nov 28 guilty plea.
Cunningham's attorney, K. Lee Blalack, declined to comment to The Washington Post Friday, saying he would not disclose what the former congressmen "has or hasn't done" to meet his pledge to cooperate with the government.
Sanjay Bhandari of the San Diego U.S. attorney's office, which is leading the probe of Cunningham, also declined to comment on the report.
Cunningham, an eight term representative and decorated former fighter pilot, tearfully resigned from Congress after admitting that he took millions in bribes from defense contractors including cash, house payments, a Rolls Royce, a yacht and a 19th century Louis Philippe commode.
The FBI is still conducting its investigation of defense contractors and others tied to the former lawmaker.
The attorney for Randall "Duke" Cunningham issued a statement Monday denying that the disgraced former congressman had worn a concealed microphone to gather evidence against other public officials but declined to specify if he wore one in conversations with private individuals.
The statement issued by K. Lee Blalack, attorney for the former eight term Republican member of Congress, said that: "The press, citing unnamed sources, continues to report that Duke Cunningham wore a tape recording device, or wire, to surreptitiously gather evidence on behalf of the government.
This story is false.
"Duke has never worn a body wire during any conversations with his former congressional colleagues or any other public official, and he has not surreptitiously gathered evidence against any public officials."
Blalack, contacted at his Washington office, declined to clarify whether Cunningham may have gathered evidence against those who do not fit the definition of public officials, such as lobbyists or military contractors.
Cunningham resigned from Congress after pleading guilty to bribery and tax evasion.
Time magazine last week reported that Cunningham had worn a "wire" at the behest of the government.
The magazine did not specify with whom Cunningham was meeting while wearing the device, but some media outlets have suggested, without providing evidence, that Cunningham may have been talking to members of Congress.
U.S. Attorney Carol Lam declined comment on the Cunningham statement and media reports about him wearing a hidden microphone.
Jan K. Caldwell, a spokeswoman for the FBI office in San Diego, would not confirm nor deny the Time magazine report.
But a source close to the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that Cunningham did wear a recording device but would provide no further details.
In his Nov 28 plea agreement with federal prosecutors, the 63 year old Cunningham promised to help with the ongoing investigation.
The agreement gives no indication of what kind of help Cunningham would provide, or whether he had already helped prosecutors.
He faces sentencing Feb 27 on his guilty plea to taking $2.4 million in bribes and avoiding more than $1 million in federal income taxes.
The agreement lists four unnamed co conspirators.
None has yet been charged.
Through subpoenas issued in the case, the four are known to be two defense contractors and two persons linked to them.
Although it is known that the contractors Mitchell Wade and Brent Wilkes gave contributions to other elected officials, nothing in Cunningham's plea agreement indicates the case involves such officials.
Under the rules of the House of Representative, any member who is subpoenaed must announce that fact on the House floor.
Cunningham made such an announcement when the investigation in San Diego and Washington got under way, but there have been no other announcements.
In exchange for bribes, Cunningham admitted, he helped the contractors through his position on powerful House committees.
The committees can influence the awarding of lucrative defense contracts, particularly since the Sept 11 terrorist attacks which has prompted the Pentagon to increase spending for intelligence projects.
Cunningham resigned from Congress within days of his guilty plea in federal court.
An April 11 special election is set to fill the remaining months of his eighth term.
Times staff writer Greg Krikorian contributed to this report.
Prosecutors asked that former Rep Randy "Duke" Cunningham be sentenced to the maximum of 10 years in prison for his "stunning betrayal of the public trust" by accepting bribes.
"Cunningham used his status as a war hero to get into Congress, and then he used his Congressional office to get rich," prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum issued Friday.
"For the better part of a decade, Cunningham, in effect, erected a 'for sale' sign upon our nation's capital."
The former Vietnam War flying ace and "Top Gun" Navy flight instructor is to be sentenced March 3 in federal court in San Diego.
The Cunningham case is one of several scandals involving Republican lawmakers that have left the party nervous about midterm elections in November that could return control Congress to Democrats.
The investigation of lobbyist Jack Abramoff threatens to ensnare several members of Congress, and Rep Tom DeLay, the former House Majority Leader, faces trial in Texas on money laundering charges.
Cunningham, 64, resigned from Congress in November after pleading guilty to accepting $2.4 million in bribes including a Rolls Royce, yachts, homes and antique furnishings in exchange for defense contracts and other favors.
At the time, President George W. Bush criticized Cunningham, saying "the idea of a congressman taking money is outrageous."
Bush said the former congressman should "pay a serious price" for breaking the law.
Cunningham's attorney Lee Blalack said he would recommend a six year sentence.
Because of his age and history of prostate cancer, 10 years "is essentially a sentence of death," he said.
"Given his contribution to this country and the community of San Diego, notwithstanding his admitted wrongdoing, such a sentence is grossly excessive," Blalack said.
Prosecutors also asked U.S. District Court Judge Larry Burns to order Cunningham to pay the nearly $1.6 million (euro1.35 million) he owes in taxes and forfeit his interest in his 7628 square foot (687 square meter) mansion in Rancho Santa Fe, one of America's wealthiest communities.
The home sold in December for $2.6 million (euro2.2 million).
The prosecution's memo contained a copy of a "bribe menu" written under the congressional seal on Cunningham's office stationery.
One column of figures represented the millions of dollars in contracts that could be "ordered" from Cunningham, according to prosecutors.
The other column showed the amount of bribes Cunningham demanded in return.
According to the sentencing memorandum, Cunningham offered co conspirator No. 2 identified elsewhere as defense contractor Mitchell Wade $16 million in contracts in exchange for a $140000 bribe, which came in the form of a 42 foot (12.6 meter) yacht, named the "Duke Stir."
Cunningham's position on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence put him in a position to help Wade, founder of defense contractor MZM Inc. MZM's government contracts soared from less than $1 million a year to tens of millions of dollars per year.
Besides Wade, three other co conspirators were named in Cunningham's plea agreement.
They were identified elsewhere as Brent Wilkes, founder of San Diego based ADCS Inc., New York businessman Thomas Kontogiannis, and John T. Michael, Kontogiannis' nephew.
In his Nov 28 plea agreement, Cunningham admitted to accepting a Rolls Royce, yachts, homes and antique furnishings, including a 19th Century Louis Phillipe commode.
The sentencing memorandum provides a more complete catalogue of the bribes he received, including private jet flights and stays at top of the line resorts and hotels.
"Cunningham grew to expect luxury," prosecutors wrote.
"His co conspirators eagerly plied him with it."
Federal prosecutors Tuesday reaffirmed their recommendation that disgraced ex congressman Randall "Duke" Cunningham be sentenced to 10 years in prison, rejecting his bid for a lighter penalty because he is a war hero.
In a 14 page report, three assistant U.S. attorneys noted that an appellate court rejected leniency for a Vietnam veteran because of his heroism during the My Lai massacre.
The filing sets the stage for a decision Friday by U.S. District Court Judge Larry Burns.
Cunningham, a Rancho Santa Fe Republican, has pleaded guilty to taking $2.4 million in bribes and evading more than $1 million in taxes.
The prosecutors Sanjay Bhandari, Jason Forge, and Phillip L.B. Halpern said that Cunningham "bullied and hectored" Pentagon officials to award contracts to the defense contractors who had bribed him.
Cunningham's only motivation "was to ensure that his co conspirators gorged themselves at the national trough, regardless of the national interest."
Cunningham's attorneys have argued that Burns should consider Cunningham's record as a decorated fighter pilot during the Vietnam War "when he saved the lives of his fellow Americans at great risk to his own."
Awarded the Navy Cross, the service's second highest medal for bravery, Cunningham later taught at the renowned Top Gun school.
His fame, which was boosted by the 1986 movie "Top Gun" starring Tom Cruise, propelled him into politics.
But the prosecutors noted that Cunningham's last display of heroism "was three decades ago" and that his crimes were part of a scheme to enrich himself by exploiting his membership on congressional committees dedicated to national security.
The 64 year old Cunningham resigned from Congress in the middle of his eighth term after pleading guilty in November.
His attorneys K. Lee Blalack, Mark Holscher and Kristina M. Hersey argued in a filing last week that a six year sentence is more appropriate, given Cunningham's war record, his lack of criminal background, and his advanced age and declining health.
Cunningham has undergone surgery for prostate cancer.
"If Mr Cunningham is sentenced to six years in jail, the United States can rightly boast that it secured an unprecedented, even historic, punishment," Cunningham's attorneys argued.
No member of Congress convicted of corruption has ever received a sentence as high as six years, the defense attorneys wrote, adding that a 10 year sentence would probably be a "death sentence" but six years would allow him "a few short years" with his family.
As part of his plea agreement, the prosecution agreed not to seek a prison sentence of more than 10 years.
In that agreement, Cunningham pledged to help with the prosecution of his four unnamed co conspirators.
Prosecutors, in their filing, said that Cunningham could have received a sentence of more than 20 years without the plea agreement.
Last week, defense contractor Mitchell Wade pleaded guilty to bribing Cunningham with more than $1 million by paying an inflated price for his home in Del Mar Heights, Calif., and allowing him to live rent free on a yacht in the Potomac River, among other items.
No charges have been brought against any other unnamed co conspirators but the investigation continues, prosecutors said.
"The bribes Cunningham demanded and received ran the gamut from the routine (expensive means, hotels and travel) to the peculiar (buck knives, lasershot simulator system), the audacious (demands that a defense contractor pay defendant's cross country moving expenses and additional cash bribes so the defendant could comfortably pay capital gains tax on a prior bribe conveyed through a housing transaction), the self indulgent (luxury vehicles, yachts, homes, an antique Louise Philippe commode, Persian rugs) and the truly astonishing ($500000, divided into two checks from one defense contractor, and a $525000 wire transfer from a second defense contractor).
Cunningham has admitted the receipt of at least $2.4 million in bribes since 2000 ," Justice Department memo on Randall "Duke" Cunningham "The Routine": Expensive Meals, Hotels and Travel Defense contractors "routinely and lavishly" entertained Cunningham at his favorite restaurants.
The memo: "Cunningham grew to expect luxury.
His co conspirators eagerly plied him with it, "Cunningham would also be flown on private jets by these co conspirators to various locales around the country.
These private jets would cost thousands of dollars to charter.
Meals on such private jets would be catered, and would include expensive bottles of wine, lobster and other extravagances.
Accommodations were invariably exclusive, top of the line hotels or resorts ," "The Peculiar": Buck Knives and Laser Hot Shooting Simulators The memo illustrates that Cunningham grasped bribery payments in amounts both large and small.
While he asked for and received payments from contractors in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, he also accepted "gifts" of much lesser value, such as the "Laser Shot Shooting Simulator."
The memo: "This device is used primarily by federal and state agencies to train officers on marksmanship, shot placements and critical decision making skills.
Among other things, the device comes with recorded video scenarios that assists (sic) the shooter in evaluating the situation and making appropriate shooting decisions."
,One of the devices "was installed in his Cunningham's (sic) Congressional Office on Capital (sic) Hill."
"The Audacious": Capital Gains Tax Payments The memo details how Cunningham sold a home in Del Mar, Calif., at a greatly inflated price to defense contractor Mitchell Wade, who pleaded guilty Friday in the case, and then asked the contractor for more money to help pay the capital gains tax on the transaction.
In another instance, Cunningham demanded that Wade pay to ship a collection of expensive antiques, rugs and other furnishings from Virginia to California items that he had bought for Cunningham.
The memo: "Cunningham instructed Coconspirator No. 2 to write him a check for $115100 and send it to his San Diego congressional office.
To conceal the transaction, Cunningham asked that the check (no. 4704) be made payable to Cunningham's military memorabilia business, Top Gun Enterprises Inc." "The Self Indulgent": Cars, Yachts, Homes and Antiques The memo describes the complex deals through which Cunningham acquired a $350000 Virginia condo and a $2.55 million California mansion with the bribe money from defense contractors.
Equally convoluted agreements provided the congressman with two yachts, one a 47 foot boat he named the "Duke Stir," the collection of antiques and rugs, and a Rolls Royce, as outlined here.
The memo: "In approximately April 2002, Cunningham demanded $10000 from Coconspirator No. 2 to purchase a used Rolls Royce.
Coconspirator No. 2 gave Cunningham the money.
When the car arrived at the Port of Baltimore, the contractor dropped off Cunningham to pick up the vehicle.
Cunningham then demanded, and the contractor paid, thousands of dollars to restore the car."
"The Truly Astonishing": Mortgage "Financing" The memo outlines how Cunningham inveigled contractors to provide him with funds to pay off more than a million dollars in two mortgages on the $2.55 million mansion that they had essentially bought for him.
One contractor paid him $525000 on condition that he receive an additional $6 million in government funds, the other paid him $500000 in return for Cunningham's promise to support a specific defense appropriations request.
The memo: "But Cunningham was still not done.
In August 2004, Cunningham demanded that Coconspirator No. 2 pay him $500000 to eliminate the remaining mortgage burdens for his Rancho Santa Fe mansion.
In return, Cunningham promised to support a specific defense appropriations request.
Coconspirator No. 2 agreed.
To disguise this bribe, Coconspirator No. 2 divided the $500000 into two unequal checks ,both made out to Top Gun Enterprises," "The Bribe Menu" For nearly 10 years, Cunningham in effect "erected a 'for sale' sign upon our nation's capital," the memo says, showing as evidence what it called a "bribe menu," a handwritten list on Cunningham's stationery.
The memo: "In this 'bribe menu,' the left column represented the millions in government contracts that could be 'ordered' from Cunningham.
The right column was the amount of the bribes that the Congressman was demanding in exchange for the contracts."
The memo also urges the maximum sentence because Cunningham "tampered with witnesses to interfere with the administration of justice."
Once Cunningham's schemes began to be made public in newspaper reports in 2005, the memo says, he fabricated and tampered with evidence to try to make his actions see plausible.
The memo outlines how, among other actions, he pressured a real estate agent to justify the inflated sales price of one of his homes and trued to persuade a rug dealer to vouch for a false cover story for him.
Rep.
Randy Cunningham, a Republican from San Diego, resigned from Congress on Monday, hours after pleading guilty to taking at least $2.4 million in bribes to help friends and campaign contributors win defense contracts.
Cunningham, a highly decorated Navy fighter pilot in Vietnam, tearfully acknowledged his guilt in a statement read outside the federal courthouse in San Diego.
"The truth is, I broke the law, concealed my conduct and disgraced my office," the eight term congressman known for his emotional outbursts and combative conservatism said.
"I know that I will forfeit my freedom, my reputation, my worldly possessions and, most importantly, the trust of my friends and family."
Cunningham, 63, pleaded guilty to one count of tax evasion and one count of conspiracy to commit bribery, tax evasion, wire fraud and mail fraud.
He faces up to 10 years in prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and forfeitures.
Prosecutors said he received cash, cars, rugs, antiques, furniture, yacht club fees, moving expenses and vacations from four unnamed co conspirators in exchange for aid in winning defense contracts.
None of this income was reported to the Internal Revenue Service or on the congressman's financial disclosure forms, the government said.
Cunningham, who is known as Duke, lived while in Washington on a 42 foot yacht, named the Duke Stir, owned by Mitchell J. Wade, the founder of MZM Inc., a defense contracting firm that received tens of millions of dollars in federal contracts that prosecutors said Cunningham helped steer its way.
Cunningham served on the defense subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee and as chairman of the House Intelligence subcommittee on terrorism and human intelligence.
"He did the worst thing an elected official can do," Carol C. Lam, the U.S. attorney, said in a statement.
"He enriched himself through his position and violated the trust of those who put him there."
Under California law, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has 14 days to call a special election to fill Cunningham's seat.
The election must occur within 120 days.
Washington defense contractor Mitchell J. Wade is expected to enter a guilty plea in federal court here Friday morning for his role in the bribery related case involving former Rep Randall "Duke" Cunningham, R Calif., according to sources familiar with the investigation.
Wade, who founded Washington D.C. based MZM Inc., started cooperating months ago in the inquiry of Cunningham's alleged trading of "earmarks" in congressional appropriations for $2.4 million in cash, furniture, boats and house payments, sources said.
The probe began last June after the San Diego Union Tribune reported that Wade bought Cunningham's San Diego home and then resold it months later for a $700000 loss.
A short time later another newspaper reported that the congressman also was living rent free on Wade's 42 foot yacht while in Washington.
Cunningham first denied the reports, but then pleaded guilty last November to tax evasion and conspiracy to commit bribery and resigned from Congress.
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the agreement has not yet been presented in court, said Wade is expected to admit to his sweetheart purchase of Cunningham's home and to providing hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and gifts to the congressman.
At the time, he was using his position to set money aside for defense and intelligence programs for contractors, one of which was identifiable in Cunningham's plea agreement as Wade's MZM.
Wade is also expected to acknowledge that he attempted to improperly influence Defense Department contracting and procurement officials with inducements and gifts, including offers to hire members of their families, the sources said.
The plea agreement will note too how Wade and his employees gave tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to two other House members.
There is no indication that the House members face any liability.
Wade's attorney, Reginald Brown, had no comment Thursday night.
Wade has been negotiating a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington for several months, according to the sources.
The deal is expected to be presented to U.S. District Judge Ricardo Urbina Friday morning.
Channing Phillips, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office, declined comment about the case Thursday.
MZM grew from a small company in 2002 to one last year that had more than $50 million in defense contracts and 400 employees, many with high security clearances.
The company was sold last fall to a New York investment firm and renamed Athena Innovative Solutions Inc.
Rep.
Randy "Duke" Cunningham, R Calif., who is under federal investigation for his financial dealings with a defense contractor, ended a weeklong silence with a statement Thursday that asserted his innocence while acknowledging that he exercised "poor judgment" in the relationship.
The statement presented the congressman's predicament as a problem of public perception, and emphatically denied any suggestion that he had funneled taxpayer paid benefits to the contractor in exchange for personal favors.
Cunningham was responding to newspaper accounts in his district over the past two weeks about his friendship with Mitchell Wade, president of MZM Inc., a Washington based defense contractor.
Cunningham serves on the powerful House Appropriations subcommittee that hands out funds for the military.
One report detailed the sale of Cunningham's house in Del Mar, Calif., to Wade two years ago.
Wade paid Cunningham $1.675 million and took a $700000 loss when he resold it months later.
Another report said Cunningham, while in Washington, has been living on a 42 foot yacht owned by Wade.
The boat, which Wade named the Duke Stir, apparently after the congressman, is docked on the Potomac River.
In the statement, Cunningham said it was not appropriate to answer specific questions because "there is now a legal inquiry underway" and that he had hired an attorney.
Cunningham had not previously commented on reports that the FBI is investigating his activities with Wade.
"I want my constituents to know that I have acted honorably and honestly," he wrote.
"I recognize, however, that I showed poor judgment in selling my home in Del Mar to a friend who does business with the government."
"I failed to adequately consider how this transaction might be perceived by others," he added.
The congressman characterized the house sale as a transaction of convenience for both men.
Cunningham's statement said Wade expressed interest in buying the house for his company after Cunningham told Wade that he and his wife were thinking about selling it.
Cunningham said he did not put the house on a public multi listing or hire a real estate agent, in order to save money "like most people selling their own home."
He said he and Wade consulted comparable home sale data before agreeing on a purchase price.
Cunningham asserted that Wade wanted a house and office space close to MZM's operations near Miramar Marine Corps Air Station.
It could not be determined what business MZM had then in San Diego.
The lawmaker also defended his boat arrangement as proper.
He disclosed that in lieu of rent, he has paid "dock fees" and "service and maintenance" charges for the boat that have totaled "well over" $13000 since April 2004.
Previously, he had been living on his own, larger boat at the Capital Yacht Club.
The congressman told the San Diego Union Tribune that he had supported the efforts of Wade's firm to get federal contracts.
In his statement Thursday, Cunningham said: "I want my constituents to know that, despite my personal friendship with Mr Wade, I gave his company, MZM, no preferential treatment."
Cunningham said he "advocated funding" for a human intelligence program, which he did not name, that was supported by other lawmakers and the Bush administration.
MZM has done extensive work for an Army intelligence center in Charlottesville, Va., among other agencies, under a contract that has paid it more than $163 million since late 2002, according to Defense Department officials.

On display at the Aerospace Museum in Balboa Park is one of the F 4 Phantoms that made Randall "Duke" Cunningham famous and propelled him into national politics.
Twenty miles up Interstate 5 is the house in upscale Del Mar Heights that threatens to scuttle his political career and result in criminal charges after eight terms as a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
Cunningham, 63, a former Navy fighter pilot who shot down five MiGs during the Vietnam War and was a role model for Tom Cruise in the movie "Top Gun," is being investigated by the FBI and other federal agencies for selling his house in November 2003 to a military contractor for what may have been an inflated price.
Mitchell Wade, 42, president and chief executive of Washington based MZM Inc., bought the house for $1675000, then sold it seven months later for $975000, a $700000 loss.
The house deal was first disclosed earlier this month by The San Diego Union Tribune.Critics suggest that Wade paid Cunningham for the house as a way to illegally funnel money to a congressman who has supported his company.
The fact that for months Cunningham has lived on Wade's yacht, named the Duke Stir, berthed in the Potomac River, has raised further questions about improper financial links.
Numerous questions remain about the relationship between Wade and Cunningham, among them, how the sale price for the house was decided upon, how Wade lost $700000 on the resale amid one of the hottest real estate markets in the state and whether Cunningham is paying an appropriate rent for the use of Wade's boat.
After San Diego's North County Times revealed the yacht deal last week, Cunningham's office issued a statement offering to prove that he pays rent, but no records have been produced.
Congressional committees rarely vote on individual government contracts, but members of key panels can influence who gets the awards.
The Defense Appropriations Subcommittee on which Cunningham sits is one of the most influential.
Wade, a reserve officer in the Navy, was a program manager for communications and intelligence for the Navy and the Department of Defense for eight years before founding MZM in 1993.
The firm specializes in sophisticated intelligence gathering and analysis.
Records show that MZM has more than $66 million in at least 93 government contracts, enough to make the company No. 100 on Washington Technology magazine's list of the top federal contractors.
Cunningham has said that MZM is among those defense contractors he has favored.
A watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, has filed a Freedom of Information Act request for information about contacts made by Cunningham in favor of MZM with officials at the Pentagon or the Department of Homeland Security.
One of the few unclassified contracts between MZM and the federal government is a $1.2 million program to provide linguists and interpreters for Iraq and elsewhere.
In another contract, MZM has joined General Dynamics and other firms to upgrade "warfare services" for the Air Force.
Like most defense contractors, MZM has a political action committee that contributes to the campaigns of politicians who influence the awarding of contracts and shape public policy.
The MZM PAC has contributed to several politicians, including giving $7000 to Cunningham's 2004 campaign.
Wade has also contributed to Cunningham's own political action committee, the American Prosperity Political Action Committee, which doles out money to candidates and causes of his choosing.
In addition, Cunningham's wife, a chief of staff for an Education Department official, and one of his daughters are on the advisory council to the Sure Foundation, a nonprofit group created by Wade and his wife to raise funds for projects to aid refugee children.
Last year a congressional subcommittee on District of Columbia operations, with Cunningham as a member, allocated $100000 to the foundation.
A month after selling their Del Mar Heights home, Cunningham and his wife, Nancy, paid $2.5 million for an 8000 square foot home in exclusive Rancho Santa Fe owned by Douglas and Karen Powanda.
Douglas Powanda is a former executive vice president at Peregrine Systems, a San Diego based business software company.
Peregrine was Cunningham's third largest corporate contributor in 2004, giving $14000 in individual and corporate donations.
In late 2004, Powanda was among eight former Peregrine executives indicted by a federal grand jury in an alleged multibillion dollar securities fraud, he awaits trial.
Cunningham, known as accessible and cordial even to reporters who have written critically of him, has hunkered down in the wake of the disclosures about the Del Mar Heights house sale.
County Supervisor Bill Horn pleaded for the public to reserve judgment.
"I know everybody's pounced on him, but I think he's due his day in the public square, to explain himself," said Horn.
Cunningham serves on the Select Committee on Intelligence, and as chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Intelligence Analysis and Counterintelligence in addition to his appropriations post.
He has become a favorite for defense contractors and their lobbyists.
For his 2004 campaign, he raised $832173: of that, $74550 came from the defense electronics industry, $42500 from the defense aerospace industry, $33550 from miscellaneous defense firms, and $45250 from lobbyists with varied clients.
Times staff writers Richard Simon and Maura Reynolds contributed to this report.
Federal agents Friday raided the home of Rep Randall "Duke" Cunningham, R San Diego, as part of a grand jury probe of the congressman's links to a defense contractor.
Agents also served search warrants on the Washington offices of MZM Inc. and the yacht owned by MZM founder Mitchell Wade where Cunningham has been living for more than a year.
K. Lee Blalack, Cunningham's lawyer, called the raid "an appalling abuse of government power."
Cunningham and his wife, Nancy, were not in when agents arrived at the house in Rancho Santa Fe, an exclusive community 25 miles north of San Diego.
Blalack said that Cunningham had earlier offered to cooperate fully with FBI authorities probing the sale of his house in Del Mar Heights to Wade in 2003.
"They will apparently not take yes for an answer and have instead opted to use strong arm tactics that were designed to generate headlines," Blalack said.
An attorney from Blalack's law firm arrived at the Rancho Santa Fe house during the search, which was authorized by a secret affidavit issued by a federal grand jury in San Diego.
FBI officials declined to say what agents were searching for.
Cunningham, 63, an eight term member of Congress, is scheduled to return to his northern San Diego County district this weekend for July 4th celebrations, his first home visit since controversy began.
The federal investigation centers on the sale of Cunningham's house in November 2003 to Wade for $1675000.
His critics insist the price was inflated so that Wade could funnel money to a congressman who has been helpful in obtaining contracts for MZM.
The home was never offered publicly for sale.
Cunningham says he offered to sell the house to Wade after the contractor said he needed a place near Miramar Marine Corps Air Station where MZM has a project.
Wade sold the home months later for $975000, a $700000 loss.
Cunningham and his wife bought their 8000 square foot home in Rancho Santa Fe for $2.55 million soon after selling the Del Mar Heights house to Wade.
In a three page statement issued last week, Cunningham said that he showed poor judgment in selling home to Wade but said he never gave preferential treatment to the defense contractor.
According to the Defense Information Systems Agency, MZM has received $163 million in federal contracts, mostly for classified projects involving the gathering and analysis of intelligence.
Last month, the agency halted the awarding of any new contracts to MZM as part of a change in federal regulations requiring more competitive bidding.
The change is not related to the investigation and MZM will be allowed to bid for new projects, said Mike Thiem, spokesman for the Defense Information Systems Agency.
The federal probe into the relationship between Wade and Cunningham involves the FBI, U.S. attorney's office, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, and Internal Revenue Service, according to Jan Caldwell, spokeswoman for the FBI office in San Diego.
Cunningham has lived aboard Wade's 42 foot yacht, the Duke Stir, berthed at a Washington area yacht club on the Potomac River.
In his statement last week, the congressman said he has paid $13000 in berthing fees and maintenance costs.
Cunningham said the price of the Del Mar Heights house was determined by comparing sales of similar sized homes in the same neighborhood.
He said the work was done by real estate agent Elizabeth Todd, a longtime friend and contributor.
Todd has also received a subpoena.
Rep.
Randy "Duke" Cunningham, R Calif., is asking his contributors including the Washington defense contractor at the center of a federal grand jury probe for permission to use their campaign donations to pay for his legal defense.
Cunningham announced last month that he is not running for re election because of the investigation, which focuses on his relationship with Mitchell Wade, founder of MZM Inc.
The company has worked on several Pentagon intelligence programs that Cunningham supported as a member of the House intelligence and appropriations committees.
In letters that went to Wade and other donors earlier this month, the congressman said the government investigation could last well into next year and that his legal expenses "could exceed a million or more dollars."
Cunningham's campaign fund had $672115 in cash at the end of June.
The Federal Election Commission has approved similar requests to use campaign donations to pay legal bills.
Separately, Cunningham is setting up a legal expense trust, which will permit him to accept as much as $5000 a year from individual and corporate donors.
Investigators last month searched the homes of both men, as well as Wade's office and his yacht on the Potomac River, where Cunningham had lived rent free for more than a year.
The inquiry began after the San Diego Union Tribune reported in June that Wade had bought the congressman's home in late 2003 and sold it several months later at a $700000 loss.
Wade and his wife, Christiane Wade, donated $12000 to Cunningham between 2001 and last fall.
Cunningham told his donors that if they objected to their money paying his legal expenses, he would donate it to the House GOP campaign committee.
Mark Olson, a Cunningham spokesman, said any donor who asks for a refund will get one.
Rep.
Randall "Duke" Cunningham, R Calif., caused a stir Monday by having the clerk of the House of Representatives announce that his office has been subpoenaed.
The routine subpoena was not related to the ongoing federal investigation into the sale of Cunningham's San Diego home to a defense industry executive, but that was not part of the announcement.
Besieged by calls from reporters, Cunningham's office later said the subpoena involved a resident from Imperial County who had sought the congressman's help dealing with a federal agency.
At issue in the federal probe is the November 2003 sale of Cunningham's home in the Del Mar Heights neighborhood to Mitchell Wade, president and chief executive of MZM, for $1675000.
A month later, Wade put the house on the market where it remained for seven months before he sold it for $975000, a $700000 loss.
Profits from the November 2003 sale allowed Cunningham and his wife, Nancy, to buy a much larger home in nearby Rancho Santa Fe for $2.55 million.
Cunningham was not accessible to reporters on Monday a stance he has taken since the home sale became public a week ago.
Officials at the Imperial County Superior Court said the subpoena was part of a civil lawsuit against the county government by a man who alleged he was roughed up by Bureau of Land Management agents while in Glamis, a popular spot for dune buggy enthusiasts.
The man's father, like Cunningham, is a former Navy aviator.
He asked for help from Cunningham, who inquired of BLM about the incident.
Now the case has become a civil lawsuit and the man is seeking correspondence between BLM and Cunningham's office.
House members are required to announce when their offices have been received subpoenas.
When Cunningham's announcement did not specify the nature of the subpoena, reporters assumed it related to the home sale.
The bicoastal buzz is an indication of how intense the scrutiny Cunningham has become as federal authorities probe the circumstances surrounding the home sale to see if it was an effort by the executive to repay Cunningham for his support in gaining federal contracts.
Back in his district in northern San Diego County, critics of the home sale are writing angry letters to local newspapers and picketing Cunningham's new home in Rancho Santa Fe.
Citizens For Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a national political watchdog group, filed a Freedom of Information Act request Monday with the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to see what contacts Cunningham has made on behalf of the company, MZM Inc.
Rep.
Randall "Duke" Cunningham, R Calif., promised Thursday to produce financial records to prove that he has done nothing inappropriate by living aboard a yacht owned by the executive of a defense company that he has supported in its bid to win government contracts.
While declining to be interviewed, Cunningham issued a statement from his Washington office: "I am putting information and records together so that you will know how much I pay to stay there and you will see that everything we've done is appropriate."
The statement was issued in response to a story in The North County Times, a newspaper in Cunningham's district, reporting that Cunningham lives aboard a yacht owned by Mitchell J. Wade, president and chief executive of MZM Inc., while in Washington.
The 42 foot yacht is docked at a yacht club on the Potomac River at a boat slip rented by Cunningham.
Cunningham's own boat is being repaired.
Cunningham's real estate dealings with Wade have become a matter of partisan bickering.
Wade bought Cunningham's home in the upscale Del Mar Heights section of San Diego in November 2003 for $1675000.
Wade put the home on the market a month later and in July 2004 sold it for $975000, a $700000 loss.
Democrats have suggested that Wade may have paid an inflated price to reward a congressman who has supported his company's bid to get involved in the lucrative and highly competitive world of defense contracting.
Wade's company, which does classified intelligence work, received $40 million in contracts in 2003.
Cunningham, 63, an eight term member of Congress, sits on the Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
Free, unreported rent would be a violation of ethics laws for members of Congress.
The district, centered in the coastal communities of northern San Diego County, is considered "safe" for Republicans, with the GOP enjoying a 44.52 percent to 29.75 percent registration edge over Democrats.
Last November, Cunningham defeated Democratic candidate Francine P. Busby 58.5 percent to 36.5 percent, with the rest of votes split between American Independent, Green, and Libertarian candidates.
Busby has announced her intention to seek the Democratic nomination for next year's election.
On Thursday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced it plans to "target" the district, a move that usually means enhanced funding and campaign assistance for the party candidate.
Rep.
Randall "Duke" Cunningham, R Calif.,after a weeklong silence about his controversial home sale to a defense contractor, issued a statement Thursday saying that he showed poor judgment in selling the house to "a friend who does business with the government."
Vowing to fight to defend his reputation, Cunningham said he did nothing wrong and that he never gave preferential treatment to the contractor's firm.
Cunningham, who has also been criticized for living on the contractor's 42 foot yacht, the Duke Stir, said he paid $13000 in the past year in berthing fees and maintenance costs.
Living aboard the yacht for free would violate ethics laws.
After releasing the statement, the 63 year old, eight term congressman declined, through a spokesman, to answer questions and said all further inquiries should be directed to his Washington, D.C., attorney.
The house sale is being investigated by the FBI.
"I would never put the interests of a friend or a contractor above the interests of my country," said Cunningham's statement.
"I trust that the facts will bear out this truth over time."
Cunningham sold his home in the Del Mar Heights neighborhood of San Diego to Wade Mitchell, president and chief executive of Washington based MZM Inc., for $1675000 in November 2003.
Wade sold the home seven months later for $975000, a $700000 loss.
Critics contend that Wade paid an inflated price as a way to reward Cunningham for backing MZM's bid for lucrative defense contracts.
The company has more than $66 million in federal contracts, most to provide sophisticated intelligence gathering and analysis.
MZM's political action committee contributed $7000 to Cunningham's 2004 re election campaign.
In his statement, Cunningham repeated previous assertions that the sale was based on comparative sales figures developed by a real estate agent with a reputable firm.
He said Wade wanted to buy a home in San Diego because MZM was beginning work on a classified project at the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station.
Cunningham said he and his wife, Nancy, an official with the U.S. Department of Education, had become friends with Wade and his wife, Christiane.
Their friendship led the Cunninghams to help with a foundation that the Wades founded to help refugee children, the statement said.
The statement said any suggestion that he secured contracts for Wade's company or improperly influenced the awarding of contracts was "simply false."
A watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, has filed a Freedom of Information Act request for records of contacts Cunningham has had with Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security officials about MZM.
Francine Busby, Cunningham's Democratic opponent in last November's election, said that Cunningham's response did little to clear up ethical questions raised by Cunningham and his connection to Wade and MZM.
"Coming clean is more than just admitting what everyone already knows," she said.
"It's about showing that your actions meet the high standards of honesty and integrity."
Republicans defended Cunningham.
"When this is all over, I think the final story will be exactly what Duke says: he made an error in judgment and showed naivete in real estate but he's done nothing wrong and has always put America first in everything he's done," said Rep Darrell Issa, R Calif. Issa backed Cunningham's statement that no member of Congress is powerful enough to guarantee that a defense firm will receive a contract.
"We all champion particular technologies or companies whose products we have confidence in," Issa said in a telephone interview, "but not even a full committee chairman can put a company into legislation."
Cunningham serves on the Select Committee on Intelligence, the Military Appropriations Subcommittee and as chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence.
Cunningham said he knew that Wade wanted a home near the Miramar base and had a real estate agent send him a list of prices for comparable homes.
"At the time of the sale, I failed to adequately consider how this transaction might be perceived by others who don't know me," Cunningham's statement said. "
,Again, I recognize that I showed poor judgment in not listing the house publicly for sale."
Wade and Elizabeth Todd, the agent who provided the comparable prices, have not responded to repeated requests for interviews.
When Kay Coles James left her job as director of the Office of Personnel Management Jan 31, her story resembled that of a hundred other political appointees headed out the revolving door of government.
Now it's a case study of the potential perils of cashing in.
James, 56, appeared to be the kind of well connected player who could quickly land a lucrative private sector post and glide back into government when the right opportunity came along.
Her resume includes stints as a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, senior vice president of the Family Research Council and a Cabinet secretary for then Virginia Gov. George Allen, R. But James chose poorly.
On May 3, MZM Inc., a small and relatively unknown defense and intelligence contractor, announced that it had hired James as a senior executive vice president for national security transformation.
"Ms James brings with her a wealth of tested expertise demonstrated over twenty years in public service," MZM President Mitchell Wade said in news release trumpeting the hire.
"We look forward to Ms James providing the same quality leadership for the employees and clients of MZM Inc. as she has so successfully demonstrated on behalf of our country."
The company needed more than James could offer.
By June, MZM was under federal scrutiny after reports that Wade bought the home of Rep Randall "Duke" Cunningham, R Calif., in 2003 and sold it for a $700000 loss.
Wade also allowed the lawmaker to stay on his yacht rent free.
Investigators searched MZM's headquarters, as well as Wade's and Cunningham's homes.
Cunningham announced last month that he will not seek re election.
Wade stepped down as chief executive and president of MZM.
In the ensuing management shuffle, James briefly became the chief operating officer.
But in July the company issued a statement saying that James and another executive had "voluntarily resigned" on June 24.
All in all, it wasn't the softest landing for a former presidential appointee.
Down but not out, James remains a member of the board of directors of Amerigroup Corp., a Virginia Beach, Va. based managed health care provider.
And on July 8, Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt named her to a 28 member advisory commission that will search for ways to stabilize and strengthen Medicaid.
Kent Jenkins, a spokesman, said Amerigroup was "lucky" to have James.
"She's being sought after by a number of corporations for board seats," he said.
"She's extremely knowledgeable in a lot of critical areas.
This other business aside, she already is extremely busy."
The following editorial appeared in Friday's Washington Post: If any more proof were needed that it's imperative to resolve the standoff preventing the House ethics committee from functioning, it arrived this week in the form of news stories about Rep Randy "Duke" Cunningham, a San Diego Republican.
When Cunningham wanted to sell his house in 2003, he didn't bother to put it on the market.
Instead, according to reporting by Marcus Stern of Copley News Service, Cunningham who sits on the defense appropriations subcommittee turned to a defense contractor.
The contractor, Mitchell Wade of MZM Inc., bought the house for $1675000.
He then put the house back on the market, where it languished for 261 days before selling for $700000 less than the original purchase price.
Cunningham, meanwhile, upgraded to a $2.55 million house, with 7 1/2 baths and a five car garage.
MZM, one of Cunningham's top campaign donors, obtained millions in government contracts, the congressman, who also sits on the House intelligence committee, acknowledged to Stern that he had helped MZM win contracts, as he said he has helped other firms.
Government contracts for the company, whose Web site describes it as helping solve "enigmatic problems ,in the areas of intelligence collection and analysis," grew from $41 million in 2003 to $66 million in 2004, according to Washington Technology magazine.
Cunningham said in a statement that he didn't do anything wrong.
He said the sale price was based on "comparables from an independent source" but it turns out that source was a real estate agent whose family also has contributed heavily to Cunningham, Wade simply paid the asking price.
"I have no reason to believe the value of the house was inflated then, and I have no reason to think so today," Cunningham said.
So why did Wade take such a loss, when the San Diego housing market was booming?
And why does Cunningham, when in Washington, live on a yacht, the Duke Stir, owned by Wade?
These questions cry out for an ethics investigation.
Unfortunately, the committee is sidelined by a dispute between its chairman and ranking Democrat.
The chairman, Rep Doc Hastings, R Wash., wants his longtime chief of staff to serve as staff director, the ranking Democrat, Rep Alan Mollohan (W.Va.), says that contravenes committee rules that require bipartisan agreement on committee hiring.
As we've said before, on this one, Mollohan has the stronger argument, the last thing the committee needs is another whiff of politicization.
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R Ill., this week called the gridlock "unconscionable" but said he won't get involved in trying to end it.
"Two adult chairmen ought to be able to sit down and hire staff and go to work without somebody meddling in how they operate," Hastert said.
Maybe so, but since they can't, and since the House needs a functioning ethics committee, it's time for the speaker to lead.
Rep.
Randy "Duke" Cunningham, a Vietnam War hero and "top gun" fighter pilot, serves on the House subcommittee that appropriates money for the nation's defense.
The California Republican also lives on a yacht berthed on the Potomac that is owned by the president of a local defense firm whose contracts Cunningham has supported.
The relationship between Cunningham and the defense executive, Mitchell J. Wade, doesn't stop there.
Two years ago, Wade bought Cunningham's house in California at a price that turned out to be much higher than it fetched at resale.
Wade, who put the property up for sale soon after he bought it, had to swallow a $700000 loss.
Cunningham said that he supported government contracts for Wade's firm, Washington based MZM Inc., according to the San Diego Union Tribune, which first reported the real estate transaction Sunday.
But the congressman said in written statements that he has done nothing wrong, did not sell his house at an inflated price and would disclose additional details about paying for his stay on the yacht as soon as he compiled them.
Cunningham declined to be interviewed Thursday.
Officials at MZM did not return phone calls or respond to a visit.
Cunningham's relationship with Wade has created a furor among Democrats and interest groups, which demanded an investigation.
Naomi Seligman, deputy director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said Cunningham's "sweetheart" deals should be investigated because they might violate House rules.
Asked about the Cunningham disclosures, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D Calif., said: "I think the ethics committee has to do its job."
Wade is also involved in Cunningham's housing situation in Washington.
The North County Times of Escondido, Calif., reported Thursday that Cunningham is living at least temporarily on a 42 foot yacht owned by Wade and kept at the Capital Yacht Club.
The boat's name: Duke Stir.
It could not be determined Thursday whether the name is a reference to the congressman's nickname.
MZM and Wade also donated money to Cunningham's re election effort.
The company and its affiliates, for instance, contributed $20000 in "soft money" to Cunningham's American Prosperity PAC State Fund between 2000 and 2002, according to PoliticalMoneyLine.com.
Cunningham's ties with MZM go further.
The congressman was the keynote speaker at MZM's Christmas party for 385 people at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington last Dec 8, where he helped dispense silver dollars to recovering Iraq war veterans whom the company invited to the festivities, according to an attendee who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Cunningham also is listed on the Web site of the Sure Foundation, a charitable group with ties to MZM and Wade, as a member of an "honorary committee" for the Foxfield Races.
The twice yearly Charlottesville, Va., horse race raises money for the foundation.
Nancy and April Cunningham are among four people listed on the foundation's Web site as members of the "advisory council."
Nancy is the name of the lawmaker's wife, and he has a daughter named April.
The foundation, which tax forms said was created with a loan from Wade, lists its address as MZM's headquarters in the District.
Wade is listed on the foundation's Web site as the foundation's treasurer and his wife, Christiane, is named as its "president emeritus."
MZM also has ties to Rep Virgil Goode, R Va.
In the 2004 election cycle, Goode's largest contributor was MZM, its political action committee and its employees, including Wade, gave a total of $48551, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Goode was the principal sponsor of a provision in 2003 defense legislation that called for the creation of a military center in his district, known as the Foreign Supplier Assessment Center, which MZM was hired to run, said a senior defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The official added that the center, which is meant to check on the ownership of foreign companies that contract with the Defense Department, will do useful work, but was not a Pentagon priority and was not requested by the Defense Department.
It was mandated by Goode on MZM's behalf, the official said.
A November 2003 press release by Virginia Gov. Mark Warner, D, said Goode was "instrumental in securing this project for Virginia."
Goode himself, in the release, said, "I believe that MZM will add a new dimension to the economy of Martinsville," where the center is located.
In March, April and May of 2003 the year that Goode sponsored the legislation, Wade, his wife, MZM officer James C. King, and King's wife gave Goode's election campaign a total of $12000, according to PoliticalMoneyLine.com.
MZM's political action committee also donated $10000 to Goode's campaign in 2003.
Goode's office did not respond to requests for comment.
Wade founded MZM 1993.
Last fiscal year, the firm had about $65 million in Pentagon contracts, ranking it among the 100 largest federal information technology contractors, according to Washington Technology magazine.

Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili on Tuesday called for a new Yalta conference, a voluntary association of new European democracies whose goal would be to extend the rule of liberty throughout the Black Sea region and beyond.
In an editorial column in The Washington Post, Saakashvili said the diplomatic agreement reached at Yalta after World War II by the United States, Britain and Russia "relegated millions of people to a ruthless tyranny."
He said the division of Europe created at Yalta and the Iron Curtain that marked its boundary were history, with much of the territory allocated to Russian leader Josef Stalin now democratic nations.
"After recent discussions with Presidents Traian Basescu of Romania and Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine," Saakashvili said, "I believe it is time for a new Yalta Conference" with three main goals.
He said nations must work together to consolidate democracy in the region, and said Georgia achieved it only 18 months ago.
But Saakashvili said two regions of Georgia South Ossetia and Abkhazia "remain untouched by the freedom the rest of Georgia enjoys.
We can and must resolve these disputes to better the lives of Georgians."
He also said other nations in the region must work towards democracy.
"Moldova, like Georgia, faces a separatist region that maintains itself with cast off Soviet weaponry and the profits from an illicit economy based on trafficking in weapons, drugs and women," Saakashvili said.
"These are the last razor sharp splinters of the Soviet empire."
Saakashvili said the world can do more to aid the people of Belarus in their qeust for freedom.
"The new Yalta conference will press for liberty in Belarus through increased travel restrictions on government officials, expanded financial and material support to the opposition and enhanced training for civic society in the methods of peaceful protests that helped free the people of Ukraine and Georgia," he said.
A new Yalta conference should seek to expand the frontiers of freedom far beyond the Black Sea, he said, mentioning Cuba, Zimbabwe and Burma.
"It is time to return to Yalta."
Saakashvili said.
"This time we will not engage in a secret diplomacy in which our values are compromised and our people enslaved.
In this new association of democracies, our diplomacy will be open ,and we will begin to make Yalta a symbol of hope ."
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili, attending a major military parade celebrating independence Thursday, called on two separatist regions in the ex Soviet republic to end their isolation and reunite.
Against the backdrop of a march past by 10000 soldiers through the centre of the capital Tbilisi, Saakashvili told the people of Abkhazia, on the Black Sea coast, and South Ossetia, at the foot of the Caucasus mountains, that their future lay within Georgia.
"Nothing separates us.
All that we have, including this army, is also yours.
The time of isolation is over.
We must live together," Saakashvili said.
Saakashvili said Georgia would only "be fully free" when independence day celebrations also took place in Sukhumi, capital of Abkhazia, which like South Ossetia ousted Georgian authorities in separatist wars in the early 1990s after the Soviet collapse.
"I promise you that will happen," he said.
Saakashvili, who came to power in the "rose revolution" of 2003, has made reuniting Georgia a central theme of his presidency.
However, the Russian backed rebel leaderships in Abkhazia and South Ossetia are adamant that they are independent from Tbilisi.
Georgia's army is widely considered too small and poorly trained to retake either region by force, although units being trained by US military advisors were prominent in the Tbilisi parade.
Georgian officials frequently complain about Russian support for the separatist republics.
Saakashvili said in his speech that he wanted "friendly, but equal relations" with Moscow.
High ranking officials from Georgia and the separatist region of Abkhazia met with a United Nations envoy Thursday to discuss security issues in the tense region.
The meeting between Georgian Minister for Conflict Resolution Georgy Khaindrava and Abkhazia's foreign minister, Sergei Shamba, took place in the Gali district, which is patrolled by U.N. monitors.
It was to focus on such themes as cooperation between law enforcement authorities, minimizing bellicose propaganda and providing maps pinpointing the location of minefields to a British de mining organization, the Interfax news agency reported.
The participants agreed to meet again in mid June, and they agreed to establish a joint group to investigate reports of cease fire violations, Interfax said.
Abkhazia has run its own affairs since 1993, when separatists drove out Georgian government troops.
The Black Sea region is not recognized internationally, but has cultivated closer ties with Russia.
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili has vowed to bring Abkhazia and another separatist region, South Ossetia, back under Tbilisi's rule.
U.S. President George W. Bush expressed support for Saakashvili's policy on the regions during his visit to Tbilisi earlier this week, saying Georgia's territorial integrity must be respected.
The International Red Cross said Thursday that it would end most food aid to needy Abkhazians because the humanitarian situation in the region was improving.
The group currently gives monthly and quarterly food parcels and hot meals to more than 13000 Abkhazian residents.
It will provide quarterly aid to some families while providing others with the opportunity for training in agriculture, commerce or a craft.
President George W. Bush and US backed President Mikhail Saakashvili on Tuesday discussed Tbilisi's handling of political reforms and its prickly pro Russian separatist regions, the White House said.
Bush also reiterated "our condolences on last week's death of the prime minister, who was a champion of freedom," spokesman Scott McClellan said, referring to the February 3 demise of Zurab Zhvania.
"The two presidents had a good discussion about Georgia's ongoing efforts to advance democratic reforms, to fight corruption and to expand freedom for the Georgian people," McClellan told reporters.
"They also discussed the Georgian government's serious settlement plan to resolve its separatist conflict in south Ossetia by peaceful means," he said.
Zhvania had been the key interlocutor with Russia over Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two separatist regions that the president has promised to bring back under Tbilisi's control.
Last summer, fighting broke out on the border between Georgia and South Ossetia between Georgian and Ossetian forces.
"The two leaders underscored their commitment to deepen our country's cooperation in pursuit of freedom, prosperity and peace, in the region and beyond," said McClellan.
Two Georgian police officers have been abducted in South Ossetia in what Georgian authorities described Thursday as an attempt to sabotage the peace process with the separatist region.
The two officers, Lado Chalauri and Gochi Gvimradze, were taken hostage by an armed group in the village of Ergneti, on the administrative border between South Ossetia and Georgia.
The governor of the Georgian border region of Chida Kartli, Mikhail Kareli, told AFP that the two officers had been taken to a detention centre in Tskhinvali, the major city of South Ossetia, and the abduction was designed to disrupt peace talks with the separatist region.
"The abduction of the Georgian police officers is a provocation by the government of (South Ossetian president) Eduard Kokoity," Kareli said.
"This crime was committed when Georgian authorities and non government organisations are examining the question of a new statute for South Ossetia which could bring an end to the conflict and bring peace to the people of the region".
The head of Georgia's Security Council, Guela Bejouachvili, said security forces were conducting intense negotiations with their Ossetian counterparts to free the two police officers as soon as possible.
The Georgian government was expected to meet soon and the worsening of the situation in the conflict zone with South Ossetia would be one of the main items on the agenda, officials said.
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said on January 12 he would present official proposals to the separatist and Russian backed territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by the end of this month.
Abkhazia fought a civil war against Georgia with the help of Russian mercenaries in the 1990s, and it remains a de facto Russian protectorate.
Both the government and the opposition reject its incorporation into Georgia.
South Ossetia also fought a brief war with Tbilisi in the early 1990s.
Moscow has sent peacekeeping troops to the region and has granted most of the region's ethnic Ossetian residents Russian citizenship.
Brought to power by a peaceful "rose revolution" one year ago, Saakashvili has set reuniting his country as his most urgent priority.
Around 100 people, including family and friends of the two hostages, gathered Thursday morning in front of the Ergneti border post, demanding the authorities take action to free the hostages.
The Hotel Iveria, a Soviet era showpiece on prime Tbilisi real estate, is an empty hulk, the wind whistling through its glassless windows.
For Georgia, that's a sign of progress.
For the past decade, the 20 story hotel on the capital's main avenue, commanding a stunning vista of mountains and valleys, had been a slum with a view: It was jammed with more than 1000 refugees from one of the separatist wars that keep the Caucasus region in sporadic turmoil.
Then a developer bought the refugees out for US$7000 (euro5485) a room in order to redevelop the hotel for the upmarket guest trade.
But many refugees complained the payoff wouldn't buy them suitable replacement housing.
One problem dispensed with, another created.
It's a pattern characterizing much of Georgia's effort to pull itself out of the abyss of poverty and corruption it had plunged into under longtime leader Eduard Shevardnadze, who was ousted in the "Rose Revolution" protests of November 2003.
His reform oriented successor, Mikhail Saakashvili, was inaugurated on Jan 25, 2004.
Now comes the death of Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania, who had been in office slightly less than a year when he succumbed to apparent carbon monoxide poisoning by a faulty space heater, and new anxieties have arisen about Georgia's prospects for real change.
What would seem a preposterous way for a high ranking official to die in a developed country doesn't necessarily seem far fetched in Tbilisi, where the central heating system has been out for a decade.
But neither is the official explanation entirely accepted by Georgians.
It reflects the lingering distrust of a government many of whose members served under Shevardnadze, says Georgian political analyst Davit Usupashvili.
Some of the transformations over the past year have been unambiguously positive: long delayed salaries for teachers and civil servants have been paid, highways once infamous for wheel eating potholes are under repair, military restructuring has boosted the once ragged armed forces' confidence.
"They've accomplished a remarkable amount," U.S. Ambassador Richard Miles said of the government's moves, adding praise of moves to purge government agencies of unproductive bureaucrats.
Some other moves are a matter of going forward at an oblique tack.
Georgia and Russia have agreed to restore rail links, severed since the conflict over Georgia's breakaway northwest region of Abkhazia.
But with Abkhazia still refusing to countenance possible reintegration into Georgia, the trains will skirt Abkhazia by taking to the Black Sea on ferries.
Initial satisfaction over a series of well publicized arrests in a war on corruption and criminal gangs darkened after many of those arrested were allowed to avoid prison terms by refunding what they allegedly stole.
The practice was censured this year by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the continent's top human rights body, dealing a blow to the respect widely accorded to Saakashvili's reformist government.
"The government should say an absolute 'no' to the absolute abuse of power," said analyst Usupashvili.
But Miles said one could argue that the system has its merits, especially given the still shaky court system.
"It doesn't fit exactly with the rule of law," the ambassador said, but added that it may work better than submitting cases to "a judicial process that might or might not prove successful."
Abkhazia isn't the only restive corner of this South Carolina sized country of 5 million.
Adzharia and South Ossetia have also proved problematic.
One of the new government's most notable early successes was reasserting control over Adzharia, an autonomous region whose feudal style leader, Aslan Abashidze, had defied Tbilisi and withheld tax revenues for years.
Abashidze's decision to blow up bridges into Adzharia, supposedly to forestall a Georgian invasion, galvanized Adzharians' long simmering dissatisfaction with him.
But although Abashidze essentially drove himself out of office, his downfall appeared to make the Georgian authorities confident that South Ossetia could be brought to heel just as easily.
Instead, South Ossetian and Georgian forces launched into a brief but intense spasm of fighting, and South Ossetia is now figuring in the rumors and conspiracy theories surrounding the strange death of Prime Minister Zhvania.
Zhvania had been pushing for a negotiated settlement, which could include an offer of autonomy apparently similar to that in Adzharia which so irritated Tbilisi.
Some have claimed to see the hand of Georgia's giant neighbor, Russia, which has powerful interests in a neighbor that also is close to oil fields, and abuts both war torn Chechnya and NATO member Turkey.
The Kremlin has sharply dismissed these suspicions.
Georgian officials, while insisting Zhvania's death was an accident, have brought in the FBI to investigate.
Usupashvili, the analyst, declined to say whether he believed the official explanation for Zhvania's death but noted that the authorities who made it "are well known for signing false statements in the past."
Twelve residents of Georgia's separatist republic of South Ossetia were abducted Saturday by kidnappers seeking the release of a Georgian police officer seized three days earlier in the region, authorities in Tbilisi and in South Ossetia said.
One of the 12, identified as Makhar Gassyev, a member of the South Ossetia's self declared "government", was released later in the day, according to pictures shown on Georgian television.
The 12 were seized in Ergneti, near the border between South Ossetia and the rest of Georgia, by kidnappers demanding the release of policeman Lado Chalauri.
Chalauri and another Georgian policeman, Gochi Gvimradze, were kidnapped Wednesday night, also in Ergneti, but Gvimradze was later released following negotiations.
"We will do all we can to prevent an escalation of violence from taking place.
But Georgian authorities will never exchange the Georgian policeman for the Ossetian delinquents," said the head of Georgia's National Security Council, Guela Bejouachvili.
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili was to attend an emergency meeting of the national security council to discuss the crisis.
"We will not release the hostages until the Georgian policeman is freed," one of the kidnappers told Georgian television.
"Otherwise, we will block all roads leading to Tskhinvali," the major city of South Ossetia, "and we will keep hold of the hostages."
Russia's foreign ministry Saturday demanded the release of the 12 hostages, warning in a statement of "escalation of the conflict" between Tblisi and South Ossetia.
The governor of the Georgian border region of Chida Kartli, Mikhail Kareli, said Thursday that the abduction of the two officers was designed to disrupt peace talks with the separatist region.
On January 12 Saakashvili said he would present official proposals to the separatist and Russian backed territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by the end of this month.
Abkhazia fought a civil war against Georgia with the help of Russian mercenaries in the 1990s, and it remains a de facto Russian protectorate.
Both the government and the opposition reject its incorporation into Georgia.
South Ossetia also fought a brief war with Tbilisi in the early 1990s.
Moscow has sent peacekeeping troops to the region and has granted most of the region's ethnic Ossetian residents Russian citizenship.
Brought to power by a peaceful "rose revolution" one year ago, Saakashvili has set reuniting his country as his most urgent priority.
Mikhail Saakashivili, the pro Western leader of Georgia who came to power last year after leading a popular revolt against a Soviet era regime, visited Moldova Wednesday ahead of key legislative elections and denounced separatism in the former Soviet Union.
Saakashvili and Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin held talks here and afterwards issued a joint declaration in which both leaders criticized separatist movements in their own ex Soviet republics and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union.
"Separatist leaders have created an international criminal alliance," Saakashvili told reporters after meeting Voronin.
He accused the leader of Moldova's pro Russian breakaway region of Transdniestr of helping supply weapons to pro Russian separatist forces in Georgia's regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and described separatism as a source of crime, smuggling and general lawlessness.
"There is a link between our countries," Saakashvili said, referring to Georgia and Moldova.
"It is the link of countries that have a shared European history and that aspire to a shared future in a united Europe where there is no place for separatism, lawlessness and crime," the Georgian leader said.
He said it was imperative that Sunday's legislative elections in Moldova were democratic, saying "very much depends" on the the conduct of the vote.
If the elections were peaceful and democratic then Moldova "will enter an entirely new phase" of its political development since the breakup of the Soviet Union, he said.
Voronin, who on Tuesday paid a suprise visit to Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko, another pro Western leader who recently led a popular revolt against a Soviet era regime, agreed with Saakashvili.
In the joint declaration he and Saakashvili signed, "we called things by their real names," he said, adding: "We concluded that separatist republics are a 'black hole' where chaos rules.
And we stated our determination to join forces to resolve these problems," the Moldovan leader said.
Voronin's Communist Party is expected to hold on to power that it assumed during the last parliamentary polls in 2001.
In an interview with the Russian daily Kommersant published Tuesday, Voronin said he feared fraud will mar Sunday's polls and warned against "provocations" in Transdniestr.
He said he also had word of a Russian inspired plot against him.
President Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia, seeking to reunite his country, Wednesday offered autonomy to the separatist republic of South Ossetia but the offer was immediately rejected by the Ossetian leadership.
Unveiling how he plans to keep his election campaign vow and reunited fractured Georgia, Saakashvili told European parliamentarians that he was willing to give more independence to separatist regions, as long as Georgia remained whole.
But South Ossetia's leader Eduard Kokoity said in Moscow that "I see our future in Russia."
Saakashvili said in a speech at the Council of Europe that autonomy would comprise "the right for a local government elected freely and directly that would include an executive branch and a parliament."
Speaking in Moscow, Kokoity said 95 percent of the breakaway republic's inhabitants have Russian citizenship, and that "for several years now we have lived by following Russian legislation." he said.
Saakashvili did not raise the issue of Abkhazia, another separatist republic, which fought a civil war against Georgia, a former Soviet republic, with the help of Russian mercenaries in the 1990s.
He said talks with the republic, which is a de facto Russian protectorate, "would be of no use" sin'ce the Abkhazian leadership "walked out of the negotiations" and there was noone with whom to deal on the other side.
South Ossetia also fought a brief war against Georgia in the early 1990s.
Moscow has sent peacekeeping troops to the region and has granted most of the region's ethnic Ossetian residents Russian citizenship.
Brought to power by a peaceful "rose revolution" one year ago, Saakashvili has set reuniting his country as his most urgent priority.
He said that that as far as South Ossetia was concerned, the possibilities he outlined were realistic.
He urged the local population there to prompt their politicians to accept the plan.
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili has stressed his determination to bring the separatist republic of Abkhazia back into national fold, despite its newly elected leader's resolve to go it alone.
"As for Abkhazia, we do not intend to yield anything to anyone, we will never pretend that nothing happened," Saakashvili told reporters late Monday.
Earlier this month Sergei Bagapsh, the new self styled president of this mountainous Black Sea territory said his victory proved Abkhazia to be a viable state and pledged to fight on to have its de facto independence internationally recognised.
However, Saakashvili shrugged off Bagapsh's statement as coming from "a man hard pressed during a difficult election campaign".
"When separatists say they will not return to Georgia, I answer don't, it is we who will return to Abkhazia," Saakashvili quipped.
The Georgian leader also called on Russia, whose ties with Georgia's separatist republics have long complicated relations between Moscow and Tbilisi, to join his efforts.
"If Russia helps us resolve regional conflicts, we shall become the nicest and sweetest of neighbors," Saakashvili said.
A small appendage on Russia's southern flank, Abkhazia won its de facto independence from the former Soviet republic Georgia in a war shortly after the break up of the Soviet Union.
Saakashvili, who rode to power on a wave of popular protests a little over a year ago, has pledged to reunite Georgia with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, another separatist region, before the end of his presidency.
One year ago, young Georgian opposition leader Mikhail Saakashvili led massive street protests that toppled the old regime after the parliament was stormed November 22, promising a breath of change to transform this troubled ex Soviet republic into a modern state.
Having easily swept to the presidency months later, the 36 year old US educated lawyer faced a massive challenge widespread corruption, separatism and economic and social decay had turned one of the richest regions in the Soviet Union into a massive challenge.
Saakashvili attacked the problems with the zeal of a revolutionary, raising heckles from some, praise from others, and all the while under the watchful eye of Russia and the United States, former Cold War foes who are vying for influence in the strategic nation.
"Without the rose revolution, it would have been a catastrophe, but Saakashvili continues to have the approach and rhetoric of a revolutionary," Avto Dzhokharidze of the Caucasus Institute for Peace and Development said.
Critics have accused Saakashvili of being a closet authoritarian, who has strengthened his power and sees no qualms in going after critics.
As evidence, they point to the constitutional changes that he instituted in January, greatly strengthening his powers at the expense of the fractious parliament.
"Today, there is no more balance of power in Georgia," said Vakhtang Khmaladze, a former lawmaker.
They also say that under his stewardship, media in Georgia have faced increasing pressure to toe the party line, leading to self censorship in the press.
"Since he became president, it has become impossible to write articles criticizing the authorities," said Revaz Okruashvili, an editor of independent regional newspaper Khalkhis Gazeti.
Meanwhile Saakashvili's aggressive fight against corruption, under which former top officials have been forced to pay back large sums to avoid imprisonment, has also raised eyebrows.
"The anti corruption campaign is selective, it depends on the personal will of the president and not on the law," says Levan Berdzenishvili, an opposition deputy.
Nevertheless, Georgians have nearly all welcomed the disbandment of the notoriously corrupt traffic police, the bane of every driver, and its replacement by a small, well paid force modelled on the US highway patrol.
Separatism remains one of Saakashvili's biggest challenges though Saakashvili succeeded in bringing the semi autonomous Adjara region under central control, separatist Abkhazia and South Ossetia show no intention of following suit.
At least 17 Georgian soldiers were killed this summer in clashes with South Ossetian forces, raisinnew government," the opposition deputy Berdzenishvili said.
While pensions have gone up by two dollars per month, inflation estimated at 10 percent has eroded the purchasing power of the population.
Analysts say Saakashvili has yet to deplete the enormous amount of hope and trust that he got after assuming power.
"It's been a hard year for me, but I still think that Saakashvili is the best president Georgia could ever have now," said Nino Aznaurashvili, a 26 year old former government employee who was fired after Saakashvili's election.
Residents of the separatist Black Sea region of Abkhazia choose a new president Sunday in an election that will throw a new spotlight on tensions with Georgia.
The vote is the first time residents of the breakaway Georgian region will cast ballots since its leader, Vladislav Ardzinba, took the helm more than 15 years ago when Abkhazia and Georgia were still part of the Soviet Union.
No matter what the outcome, the vote is likely to increase tensions with Tbilisi, which, under President Mikhail Saakashvili's leadership, has sought to rein in renegade regions.
"It's written in our constitution that Abkhazia is a sovereign country," said Manana Gurgulia, a well known Abkhazian journalist.
"All candidates for president are unanimous on this question.
Abkhazia will never be part of Georgia."
The five candidates running for president have focused their rhetoric on Abkhazia's languishing economy, which has been crippled by sanctions from Tbilisi and a lack of international recognition.
Most Abkhazians are unemployed.
Ardzinba, 59, has been ill in the past year reportedly with cancer and largely turned over day to day affairs to Prime Minister Raul Khadzhimba, who is considered the front runner among the five candidates.
His main challenger is Sergei Bagapsh, head of the Chernomorenergo state energy company and leader of the United Abkhazia opposition movement.
Bagapsh, who is running with the support of other opposition groups, has campaigned on promises of raising the average wage and combatting rampant crime.
"Of course, we have real hope for these elections," said Arda Inalipa, 47, who runs a non governmental organization in the region's capital, Sukhumi, providing counseling to women who suffered during the war with Georgia.
"It's a difficult situation for us here, but we're trying to create our own small, democratic republic."
Georgia's Minister for Conflict Resolution Georgy Khaindrava said in Moscow on Friday that all the candidates are anti Georgian but that it might be easier to negotiate with Khadzhimba, who he said is considered to have Russia's backing after a meeting with President Vladimir Putin.
"For Tbilisi it doesn't really matter who wins, because they don't have any pro Georgian politicians at all," Khaindrava told a news conference.
Since winning a landslide election in January, Saakashvili has repeatedly vowed to reunify his fractured country.
Earlier this year, he forced the leader of the autonomy minded Adzharia region, Aslan Abashidze, to flee to Russia.
Saakashvili has had less luck in bringing Abkhazia and another region, South Ossetia, back into the fold.
Abkhazian separatists drove out Georgian government troops in a war in the early 1990s, displacing roughly 300000 ethnic Georgians.
The region has effectively run its own affairs ever since and cultivated close ties with Georgia's giant neighbor, Russia.
Russian peacekeepers have been deployed in the region since 1994, but Georgia distrusts Russian intentions.
Abkhazia's lush Black Sea coast is a popular destination for Russian tourists, who commonly arrive by boat.
About 70 percent of Abkhazia's residents have Russian citizenship, and the region uses the Russian ruble not the Georgian lari.
Tensions spiked in August after Saakashvili ordered all ships arriving in Abkhazia to be screened by Georgian customs and immigration authorities and he ordered patrols to open fire on boats violating Georgia's waters.
The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted angrily, accusing Georgia of trying to damage the Abkhazian economy.
Saakashvili has cooled his rhetoric somewhat since the summer.
At the U.N. General Assembly in New York last week, he said Tbilisi was prepared to offer "the widest possible autonomy" to Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
But as far as Nugzar Ashuba, speaker of the Abkhazian parliament, is concerned, Saakashvili isn't to be trusted.
"Abkhazia never was part of Georgia so how is it possible for us to have 'the widest possible autonomy'?"
Ashuba said.
Georgia and its pro independence region of South Ossetia Friday agreed to withdraw troops from conflict areas at a bilateral meeting held in Russia's black sea resort of Sochi, said reports reaching here.
Georgian Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania and South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity agreed that all the armed forces, but the peace keepers by the two sides and Russia and some police, would be pulled out of the conflict zone.
The agreement was reached under the mediation of the Russian Foreign Ministry.
Topics discussed during the meeting also included resuming rail transportation between Georgian capital Tbilisi and South Ossetian capital Tskhinvali.
Zhvania said the talks would promote dialogues between the two sides and ensure a territorial integrity for Georgia.
Kokoity, for his part, said he hoped the agreement, which would help stabilize the region, would be successfully implemented.
South Ossetia proclaimed its independence after the former Soviet Union broke up and then fought a war with Georgia's government forces in early 1990s.
To end the conflict, Russia, Georgia, South and North Ossetia set up a joint supervision committee in 1992, and a tripartite security force by the Russia, Georgia and South Ossetia was sent to the conflict region.
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili, who took office in January, has vowed to reunify the country by bringing South Ossetia and Abkhazia back under Tbilisi's control.
Tensions between Tbilisi and South Ossetia have heightened since late May this year when Saakashvili briefly sent troops into the region.
A temporary calm was brought by a bilateral cease fire agreement signed on Aug 15 in the South Ossetian capital Tskhinvali.
One year ago, Mikhail Saakashvili led massive street protests that toppled the old regime in Georgia, promising to transform this impoverished former Soviet republic into a modern state.
Today Saakashvili has retained overwhelming support in this strategic Caucasus nation, over which Russia and the United States are vying for influence, even though many of Georgia's problems corruption, economic malaise, separatism remain.
After leading the "rose revolution" that forced longtime leader Eduard Shevardnadze to resign on November 23, Saakashvili easily swept to the presidency on a wave of hope that this onetime prosperous republic could climb out of the poverty where it had wallowed since the Soviet Union's collapse.
Support for the 36 year old US educated lawyer may not be as fervent as a year ago, but it remains strong his job approval rating currently is 86 percent, compared with 90 percent last February following his inauguration, according to a poll released last week by the Gorbi polling agency.
"It's been a hard year for me, but I still think that Saakashvili is the best president Georgia could ever have now, especially after Shevardnadze," said Nino Aznaurashvili, a 26 year old former government worker.
The tall polyglot Saakashvili speaks fluent English and French, in addition to Georgian, Russian and Ukrainian admits that his reforms have a way to go.
"When we started, this country didn't look like a state, we did everything from scratch," he said in an interview last week.
"It's a long way before (the benefits) get to the ordinary people."
The major challenges facing Saakashvili have not changed corruption, an economy largely unreformed since Soviet times, and separatism.
Saakashvili's aggressive fight against corruption, under which former top officials have been forced to pay back large sums to avoid imprisonment, has raised eyebrows.
"The anti corruption campaign is selective, it depends on the personal will of the president and not on the law," says Levan Berdzenishvili, an opposition deputy.
Saakashvili denies the charge.
Georgians have nearly all welcomed the disbandment of the notoriously corrupt traffic police, the bane of every driver, and its replacement by a small, well paid force modelled on the US highway patrol.
Separatism remains one of Saakashvili's biggest challenges though Saakashvili succeeded in bringing the semi autonomous Adjara region under central control, separatist Abkhazia and South Ossetia show no intention of following suit.
At least 17 Georgian soldiers were killed this summer in clashes with South Ossetian forces, raising tensions to fever pitch in the rebel territory, which like Abkhazia declared independence following a civil war in the early 1990s.
"The operation in South Ossetia was a total defeat.
Trust built up over years was destroyed by Saakashvili's lack of strategy," said Georgi Tarkhan Muravi of the Institute for Political Studies.
But Saakashvili remains upbeat.
"I am confident that Abkhazia and South Ossetia will return to Georgia within the next five years," he said.
Relations with Russia, the traditional power broker in the region which backs the separatists, have taken a turn for the worse as a result of the anti separatist drive.
On the economic front, several important reforms are underway in areas including education and tax, and big efforts have been made to cut the layers of bureaucracy inherited from the Soviet era.
"Unfortunately, the systematic replacement of professionals by young people who are often unqualified is one of the most serious problems created by the new government," says one opposition deputy.
While pensions have gone up by two dollars per month, inflation estimated at 10 percent has eroded the purchasing power of the population.
Saakashvili, who has named an ethnic Georgian oligarch from Russia as his economy minister, has put emphasis on privatization and reforming the tax code in economic reforms and remains confident of their effect.
"Next elections are in almost four years' time," Saakashvili said.
"That's exactly when we should start to get a return from reforms."
The old white Zhiguli fairly flew down the highway, skimming precariously over the potholes as Garri Nersesov clutched the wheel and declared victory in the war on corruption.
"There's no police!" he proclaimed, waving a hand when he mustered the nerve to take it off the wheel toward the empty roadside.
"It used to be, you had a policeman sitting under every bush.
I could never drive this fast,They would stop you and rob you!"
Score one taxi driver on the side of President Mikheil Saakashvili's drive to end the tyranny of Georgia's notoriously corrupt street cops.
Half the nation's police force nearly 15000 officers was fired earlier this year.
Those remaining got jaunty, American style police uniforms, new Volkswagen Passats and salaries high enough to help resist the urge to collect on the spot traffic fines.
Saakashvili was elected after Georgians flooded the streets last November and ousted President Eduard A. Shevardnadze in an uprising known as the "Rose Revolution."
In less than a year, Saakashvili has succeeded in slashing the state bureaucracy by 35 percent, wresting back the breakaway region of Adzharia, raising pensions and nearly doubling the nation's tax and customs revenues.
But the brash 36 year old with the boyish, pudgy cheeks and a Columbia University law degree also has engaged in some brinkmanship with neighboring Russia.
He is finding it increasingly difficult to convince his constituents and the world that the dysfunctional Caucasian backwater he inherited can be transformed overnight into a prosperous democracy by the force of his own audacious determination.
Disappointment fueled by impatience is on the rise.
Almost daily, protesters take to the streets over low wages and the sale of state owned factories to companies abroad.
Moreover, the government which swept to power under the banner of democracy faces challenges to its human rights record.
Police have broken up at least three demonstrations since July and jailed a former state audit official who was allegedly tortured after his arrest.
In the town of Gori, a respected newspaper editor who published articles critical of the Saakashvili appointed governor was arrested.
He says a packet of drugs was shoved into his pocket.
For many, disillusionment with the new Georgia is as simple as being as poor now as they were a year ago.
Worse, prices have escalated sharply in the last few months, and many worry that Saakashvili's tough talk against Russia has hurt their chances to sell goods there.
"It's ,bad," said Yuri Koloskov, a 57 year old shoe repairman who was an engineer before the collapse of the Soviet Union and Georgia's subsequent independence.
"Whatever he promised us, he delivered nothing.
I'm not against being friendly with America, but we mustn't forget that ordinary people need a market to sell their stuff, and our market is Russia.
As long as we have tense relations with Russia, we'll see nothing here."
Gyorgy Dzhangidze, a college economics student, said he and his friends didn't expect to find a job paying more than $400 a month.
"We were fighting for him in Rustaveli Street.
And it's not that he failed us," he said.
"But we didn't see the results we expected."
Saakashvili's team, many of them also young, U.S. educated professionals, said they realized their time to turn the country around was short.
"We understand now that the honeymoon is over.
We realize every single day how hard it is to run a small country in this part of the world," said Georgia's national security adviser, Gela Bezhuashvili.
"The revolution gave people hope, but nobody talked to them about what democracy is, what independence is, how much it costs."
After his stunning electoral victory in January with 96 percent of the vote, Saakashvili dismissed several ministers and other senior officials suspected of corruption and declared his intention to end the de facto secession of the pro Russian regions of Adzharia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
By May, the young president had sent Adzharia's feisty strongman, Aslan Abashidze, packing to Moscow, in the process, he regained access to the busy Black Sea port at Batumi and its millions of dollars in revenues.
Next, Saakashvili set his sights on Abkhazia and South Ossetia, virtually independent since conflicts frozen in the early 1990s.
There, he hit a brick wall entrenched Russian support and a population viscerally opposed to union with Georgia quickly ignited new conflict.
Seventeen Georgian soldiers died in clashes in South Ossetia after Saakashvili closed down a booming $20 million annual trade in Russian goods smuggled through the lawless region.
In Abkhazia, where thousands of Russian tourists spend their summers at low budget Black Sea resorts, Saakashvili threatened to sink Russian tour boats.
Russia has been doing its own share of blustering.
After the terrorist seizure of a school at Beslan, Moscow declared that it was prepared to launch pre emptive strikes against terrorist refuges.
In view of Russia's frequent complaints that Georgia shields Chechen rebels in the remote Pankisi Gorge, most took the declaration as a thinly veiled threat to bomb Georgia.
(Begin optional trim) The newly assertive Georgian president clearly has Moscow worried.
"He is extremely popular, and while he is popular, he fancies himself invincible.
He destabilizes the situation with his simplistic moves ,," Gleb Pavlovsky, an analyst close to the Kremlin, told the Russian newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta.
"It means that Russia will have to stop this man sooner or later."
(End optional trim) The prospect of a new war in the Caucasus would provoke unease in the United States, which last year spent $20 million on democracy building programs in Georgia and is Saakashvili's biggest international booster.
At home, Saakashvili still enjoys a confidence rating of more than 80 percent, according to a poll two months ago by the GORBI Sociological Survey, and many Georgians say they are proud of their tough new president.
"Of course we support him.
One hundred and fifty percent," said Lasha Chechua, an unemployed gas industry engineer.
"If he needs to go to war in South Ossetia, people must understand that this is Georgia's territory, and this whole conflict was created by a third party, Russia."
"We're up to our ears in debt," his wife, Tsetsino, said.
"But that's not Saakashvili's fault.
Everything was destroyed when he came to power.
There was nothing.
Now, we need time.
He needs time."
Yet how much time is required to turn around a nation with 17 percent unemployment, falling living standards and an industrial output barely a quarter of what it was in 1991?
For some of those who stood with Saakashvili last November demanding a more accountable government, there is a sense of urgency the new government, they say, must be held to its commitment to democracy, before the authoritarian habits that are so entrenched in most post Soviet republics are allowed to slip in.
A Tbilisi organization, Former Political Prisoners for Human Rights, has compiled 72 cases of beatings of prisoners and other police abuses since the beginning of the year.
"The right to freely express yourself no longer exists.
People have been thrown into prisons for participating in mass rallies," said Nana Kakabadze, head of the prisoners group.
(Optional add end) "I think we are on the right road.
We want to build a good, strong, free, democratic state," said the deputy speaker of Parliament, Mikheil Machavariani.
"Our partners are helping us with this, and our neighbors in Russia are very jealous of this relationship with the United States, probably because they love us so much.
"But they love us as a little brother, and we are not little brothers.
We want to be equal partners in a big family."
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili vowed Tuesday to step up preparations to defend Georgia's territorial integrity and restore control over Abkhazia, according to the Interfax.
Reports reaching here from the Georgian capital of Tbilisi said that Saakashvili promised to solve the Abkhazia issue either through negotiations or by use of state power.
But he added that Tbilisi is not prepared to start a war.
Saakashvili said that some countries are not willing to see a strong Georgia or satisfied with Georgia's control over Abkhazia.
Last Week, the Abkhazian authorities claimed that Georgia has mobilized 700 troops along the administrative border of Abkhazia.
On Sunday, Georgia's Defense Ministry refuted the above allegation, saying that all the accusations by the Abkhazian authorities were not true and were made up by some people in the Abkhazian republic trying to divert people's attention.
Abkhazia, bordering with southern Russia, announced independence in 1992, which was not recognized by any country.
In July, the Abkhazian authorities announced its withdrawal from the negotiations with the Georgian government after Georgian coast guards fired at a Turkish ship in the Abkhazian waters.
The situation in the republic has been tense after two presidential candidates disputed over the results of the elections held on Oct 3.
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said Wednesday he would present official proposals to separatist territories Abkhazia and South Ossetia by the end of this month, hoping that the people if not the Russian backed self proclaimed governments will listen.
He told the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta, "we do not expect a quick, favorable reaction from the self proclaimed governments, above all in Abkhazia," where voters were electing a new administration Wednesday.
"But we do count very much on the reaction of ordinary people, who understand perfectly well that it is impossible to live for long in a beseiged fortress," he said.
"It is necessary to find a common denominator, an understanding.
In the present circumstances, we are all losers."
Abkhazia fought a civil war against Georgia with the help of Russian mercenaries in the 1990s, and it remains a de facto Russian protectorate.
Both the government and the opposition reject its incorporation into Georgia.
South Ossetia, also protected by Russia, has declared itself independent, although no country has recognized it.
Brought to power by a peaceful "rose revolution" a year ago, Saakashvili has said that reuniting his country is his most urgent priority.
He told the newspaper that he seeks good relations with Moscow and does not wish to be involved in any dispute between Russia and the West.
He said that if the Russians had shown good will, the problem of South Ossetia would be solved already, while that of Abkhazia would have made "important progress" toward a solution.
Saakashvili said he hoped to finalise a framework agreement on relations between his country and Russia during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Tbilisi next month, and to sign a definitive agreement with President Vladimir Putin later in the year.
He said he enjoyed good personal relations with Putin, and that the Russian leader was always welcome to visit Georgia.
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili offered Friday to open talks with one of the candidates in a disputed election in the separatist region of Abkhazia, but the move was almost instantaneously rejected as a provocation.
Speaking before reporters in Tbilisi, Saakashvili said voters in Abkhazia who supported Sergei Bagapsh to be their leader "are expressing the will of the majority of the population of Abkhazia.
At this point, there is no alternative to dialogue."
But Bagapsh scorned the offer to talk.
"He's the last thing I need!"
Interfax news agency quoted Bagapsh as saying of Saakashvili.
The Georgian leader's offer of talks "is a provocation aimed at creating division within Abkhazia and between our republic and Russia.
I have no intention of negotiation with Mr Saakashvili," Bagapsh said.
Bagapsh was proclaimed winner of an October 3 election in Abkhazia to choose a new "president" to replace Vladislav Ardzinba, the man who led the republic's fight to break away from Georgia in the early 1990s.
But Ardzinba's anointed successor, Raul Khajimba, also claims to have won the poll.
Both Bagapsh and Khajimba have vowed to consolidate Abkhazia's declaration of independence, which is recognized officially by no one although Russia has tacitly supported it.
Bagapsh however rose through the ranks of the Georgian Communist Party during Soviet times, has a Georgian wife and is seen as more sympathetic to the central Georgian government.
He is therefore doubly eager to prove his credentials as a real Abkhaz nationalist.
The youthful Saakashvili, a US trained lawyer, was elected early this year and enjoys backing in the West for his campaign to bring Abkhazia and other wayward parts of Georgia back under central government control.
The United States called Monday for a resumption in talks to end the conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia but made clear it recognized neither the independence of the breakaway Georgian region nor the legitimacy of its weekend elections.
The State Department said it had no comment on the result of Sunday's poll contested between five pro independence candidates and would take no position on claims of fraud and irregularities from the presumptive favorite, Raul Khajimba.
Instead, deputy spokesman Adam Ereli said that Washington wanted whoever emerges as the new "president" of Abkhazia to resume talks with Georgian authorities.
"The United States does not recognize Abkhazia as an independent state, so I don't really have any comment on these elections," he told reporters.
"Our position is to support an international approach to a peaceful resolution of the Abkhaz conflict that respects Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and whatever leadership is in Abkhazia, we would hope that it returns to negotiations toward that end in the near future," he said.
The identity of Abkhazia's next chief matters because the picturesque enclave on the Black Sea coast is seen as a potential flashpoint between Georgia's pro Western leaders and Moscow, which has given its tacit support to the Abkhaz separatists.
Sunday's election was the first competetive vote in Abkhazia since the republic declared its independence from Georgia after winning a war 11 years ago, and was held up as proof of its democratic credentials and internal stability.
The conflict cost about 10000 lives and created hundreds of thousands of refugees, most of them ethnic Georgians who were forced to flee Abkhazia.
Fears of a new conflict have resurfaced though, since Mikhail Saakashvili, a tough talking US trained lawyer backed by Washington, was swept to power in Tbilisi late last year in a bloodless revolution.
Saakashvili has said he will not rest until Georgia's wayward regions South Ossetia and Abkhazia are back under Tbilisi's control.
This summer he announced Georgian warships would sink any vessels carrying tourists from Russia to resorts in Abkhazia.
That provoked a furious war of words with Moscow.
Renewed fighting over Abkhazia would destabilize a south Caucasus region which is soon to become a strategic gateway for oil exports from the Caspian Sea to Western markets.
Georgia on Tuesday accused Russia of interfering in its internal affairs, citing a visit to Moscow by two rival presidential candidates in the breakaway Georgian province of Abkhazia.
Former Abkhazian Prime Minister Raul Khadzhimba and his challenger, opposition leader Sergei Bagapsh, arrived in Moscow on Monday to meet with Russian officials and discuss the fiercely contested presidential vote in Abkhazia, Russian and Abkhazian media reported.
"Just as it has been for the last 10 years, who will become the next leader will be decided in Russia," Georgy Khaindrava, Georgia's minister for conflict settlement, said at a Moscow news conference, according to the Interfax news agency.
Abkhazia, which has enjoyed de facto independence since Georgian troops were driven from the region 1993, has been in turmoil after its first contested presidential vote on Oct 3.
Abkhazian election officials said that opposition leader Sergei Bagapsh won the vote, and the region's highest court later confirmed it.
But hours after issuing the verdict, the court overturned the ruling when hundreds of supporters of Bagapsh's rival, ex Prime Minister Raul Khadzhimba, broke into the court building.
Outgoing President Vladislav Ardzinba, who supported Khadzhimba, then ordered a new election a decision Bagapsh has refused to recognize.
Georgian parliament speaker Nino Burdzhanadze, also visiting Moscow, made similar accusations about Russian meddling.
She said Georgia was mulling over withdrawing from the Commonwealth of Independent States, a group uniting 12 former Soviet republics, which she called "inefficient," the ITAR Tass news agency reported.
She indicated that no final decision had been made.
Abkhazia and another separatist province of Georgia, South Ossetia, have cultivated close ties with Russia.
Tensions have escalated between Tbilisi and the two provinces as well as Russia after Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili vowed to bring the regions back under central control.
Burdzhanadze criticized Russia for unilaterally handing out Russian passports to citizens in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
"I think it's clear to everyone that the granting of Russian citizenship is being used for a single reason: to be able to say that Russia has the right to interfere in these conflicts because many Russian residents reside there," Interfax quoted her as saying.
The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) will host twin international conferences on planetary exploration and space law at Bangalore, the capital city of southern Indian State of Karnataka from June 27.
The two day international conferences, being held for the first time in India, will be attended by about 225 delegates, including 75 from the United States, China, Japan, Canada, France, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Indonesia.
ISRO Chairman G. Madhavan Nair will inaugurate the twin events.
European Space Agency director R. Jean Jacques Dordain, International Institute of Space Law (IISL) President N. Jasentullyana and former International Academy of Astronauts (IAA) President Michael Yarymovych will address the delegates in the plenary sessions.
The meetings on "Advances in Planetary Exploration" and "Space Law on Bringing Space Benefits to the Asian Region" have been organized by the Astronautical Society of India (ASI) in association with the IAA and the IISL.
The conference on planetary exploration will address the scientific, technological and future perspectives by different nations.
The space law conference will take stock of the international scenario, with a special focus on the regional perspectives of national space policy, broadcasting, remote sensing and geographical information and disaster management.
"The international space law conference this year is the third in a series of regional space law conferences, initiated in 2001, by the IISL.
These conferences bring space law and policy specialists on a common forum to discuss legal and policy issues pertaining to the regions," an ISRO statement said here Friday.
Advances in planetary sciences will be dealt with in regional workshops.
Of special interest will be the unmanned moon mission ( Chandrayaan 1), scheduled for launch in 2007 08 in association with the United States, China, Japan and Europe.
The sessions will cover the challenges and results of outreach to Mars, Jupiter, and extra solar objects, the statement said.
The IAA, founded in 1960, has 1200 members and is the world's premier professional body of space and astronautical experts.
The academy focuses on exploring space research and the ongoing exploration of the solar system.
IISL, a premier body of legal experts, deals with issues related to space and articulates the perspectives of space activities and their legal implications through special space law meets.
The delay in Ariane space program has forced the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) to reschedule the launch of INSAT 4A around August September this year.
The satellite was to be launched in the first half of 2005.
Confirming this, ISRO chief G. Madhavan Nair said in Bangalore on Monday that the European Space Agency (ESA), which is in charge of the Ariane launch program, had sought more time to launch the Indian spacecraft in the INSAT 4 series.
"The launch is likely to take place either in the last week of August or first week of September.
Ariane has faced some difficulty and delay in launching the first two satellites of other countries.
INSAT 4A is the third launch for the ESA this year," Nair said on the sidelines of a twin conference on planetary exploration and space laws in Bangalore.
The Indian satellite will be launched from French Guyana in South America.
The three ton INSAT 4A will have 12 Ku band transponders for direct to home (DTH) satellite link telecast applications and 12 C band communication transponders.
INSAT 4A is the first in the INSAT 4 series, which is planned to have seven satellites.
INSAT will have about 225 active transponders in various frequency bands by 2007, which can cater to the demand up to 11 GBPS capacity with the present day technology.
India's first unmanned moon mission planned for 2007 08 will carry three European payloads for conducting various experiments relating to the lunar surface.
The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) Monday signed a memorandum of understanding with the European Space Agency (ESA) for carrying the payloads aboard the Chandrayaan 1 (the name given to India's mission Moon) spacecraft, in Bangalore on Monday.
Bangalore, the capital city of Karnataka in South India, is hosting a twin conference on "Advances in Planetary Exploration" and "Bringing Space Benefits to the Asia Pacific Region.
The three day international event, which is being attended by some 225 delegates, including 75 from the US, China, Japan, Canada, France, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, began in Bangalore today.
ISRO is also in discussion with the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to carry American payloads on board the Chandrayaan spacecraft.
A MoU with NASA is expected to be signed in the next couple of months once the instruments and their role are finalized.
ISRO chairman G. Madhavan Nair, who inaugurated the conference, said that the US payload would weigh some 10 15 kg and comprise an X ray detector, a particle detector and a multi spectral imager.
The ESA payload would comprise instruments from Britain, Bulgaria and Germany.
These include D CIXS, a low energy X ray fluorescence spectrometer and an X ray solar monitor from Britain, RADAM, a radiation dose monitor from Bulgaria, and SIR 2, a spectrometer from Germany."
The Chandrayaan 1 will place a spacecraft weighing about 525 kg in an orbit of the moon to enable high resolution chemical, mineralogical and photo geological mapping of the lunar surface to define the process leading to the formation and chemical evolution of the moon," Nair said.
"We have the capabilities to develop and manage a mission that would orbit the moon and enable a series of observations and measurements using specific instruments, Nair added.
India's space agency said Friday that a subsidiary of Boeing Co. has canceled an agreement to help produce communication satellites.
The Indian Space Research Organization, or ISRO, said Boeing Satellite Systems pulled out after deciding to withdraw from the business of producing light satellites for which the agreement had been signed a year ago.
"We are now looking for a different partner but that's going to take some time," G. Madhavan Nair, ISRO chairman said at the agency's headquarters in southern Bangalore city.
The U.S. government, in a bid to step up high technology cooperation with India, had granted an export license for a Boeing proposal to jointly produce and market the satellites with ISRO India's equivalent of NASA in June 2004.
Under the deal, Boeing Satellite was to provide transponders and other instruments to ISRO to help design newer versions of India's INSAT communication satellites.
The partners had hoped to start selling them to other countries in 2006.
An INSAT satellite typically weighs about 2000 kilograms (4400 pounds) and hovers nearly 36000 kilometers (22500 miles) above the Earth.
It provides telephone communications, Internet access and television broadcasting.
"It is this class of satellites that Boeing decided to exit," Nair said.
The deal had been reached even as ISRO and many of its subsidiaries remained under the United States' export restriction list.
American companies must obtain an export license before selling high technology items.
Economic sanctions were imposed by the United States on India after its nuclear tests in 1998, but most have been lifted.
ISRO has also been removed from the list.
Indian and European space agency officials signed an agreement Monday to put European scientific instruments on board an India rocket that is expected to orbit the moon in 2007 or 2008, India's space agency said.
G. Madhavan Nair, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization, and European Space Agency Director General Jean Jacques Dordain signed the agreement to put the three instruments on the unmanned spacecraft, an ISRO statement said.
They include an X ray camera developed by Britain's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, an infrared camera from Germany's Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research and equipment from the Swedish Institute of Space Physics to analyze the impact of solar wind on the moon's surface.
Indian and European scientists will share the data from the instruments, the statement said.
The spacecraft is to orbit the moon at an altitude of 100 kilometers (62 miles).
ISRO also is in talks with NASA to carry similar instruments from U.S. research organizations.
India's first unmanned spacecraft will carry three European payloads on its journey to the moon, scheduled for 2007, to be used in experiments on the lunar surface, the head of the country's space programme said Monday.
The Indian Space Research Organisation signed a memorandum of understanding with the European Space Agency Monday to carry the additional payloads aboard India's Chandrayan 1 spacecraft, ISRO chairman G. Madhavan Nair told reporters.
The payloads will include instruments such as an X ray detector, a particle detector and a multi spectral imager.
ISRO is also in talks with the US National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) to carry a miniature imaging instrument to detect water ice in cold traps on the lunar poles up to a depth of a few metres (yards), Nair said.
"We have the capabilities to develop and manage a mission that would orbit the moon and enable a series of observations and measurements using specific instruments," he said.
The 590 kilogram (1298 pound) Chandrayan 1 is expected to map the lunar terrain for minerals and conduct scientific experiments.
India has developed a tracking network to monitor the spacecraft while it is in orbit.
A special ground station is also being constructed near the southern city of Bangalore where ISRO is headquartered.
The prime minister on Wednesday criticized developed countries for restricting exports to India of "dual use" technology items the United States says could be converted from civilian to military use a news report said.
However, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the restrictions have not impeded India's scientific efforts, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.
Singh claimed that India has an unblemished record of nuclear nonproliferation, which deserves the recognition of developed countries, PTI said.
For decades, Washington has restricted exports to India of dual use technology due to concerns over missile and nuclear weapons proliferation.
"These denials were misplaced and anachronistic," PTI quoted Singh as telling scientists from India's Space Research Organization, or ISRO, on the southern island of Sriharikota.
"The denial (of technology) has not impeded India's scientific efforts.
In fact, they have spurred you to greater heights," Singh was quoted as saying.
He announced that a sophisticated new propellant plant would be set up in Sriharikota for India's next generation space launch vehicle.
Sriharikota is 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Madras, the capital of Tamil Nadu state.
The United States and other Western nations imposed economic sanctions on India after its nuclear tests in 1998.
Most have since been lifted.
ISRO's plans to develop its own engine for launching space vehicles were delayed after India tested nuclear weapons in 1998, prompting the United States to pressure Russia India's traditional ally not to transfer technology for such engines.
India began its space program in 1972, and has developed launch rockets and sent up its own satellites.
The space agency says it has mastered the rocket technology needed to launch high altitude satellites and send a man to the moon.
India says it now has the capability to put heavy satellites into orbit as far as 36000 kilometers (22500 miles) from Earth.
An Indian rocket blasted off Thursday, carrying with it the country's ambitions to be a major global space power and two satellites that it launched into orbit.
The liftoff in southeastern India was the first launch of a rocket with two satellites aboard and notched up another achievement in New Delhi's ambitious space programme, which hopes to send a probe to the moon by 2007 or 2008.
The launch "augments our launch capabilities considerably and reaffirms the emergence of India as a major space power," Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told parliament in New Delhi.
The 44 metre (147 foot) Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle carried a remote sensing satellite whose detailed imaging is aimed at putting every Indian household on the map and another for South Asian home radio operators that can be used during disasters such as earthquakes and floods.
The rocket lifted off from the Satish Dhawan space port, 100 kilometres (60 miles) north of Madras, to loud cheers from scientists and their families who watched the rocket streak into a clear blue sky.
"It was a fantastically accurate flight and (satellite) injection," G. Madhavan Nair, chairman of the Bangalore based Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), told reporters.
The satellites were placed into orbit soon after lift off.
President Abdul Kalam, a scientist dubbed India's "missile man" for his contribution to the country's satellite programmes, guided and ballistic missiles projects and nuclear weapons drive, watched the launch.
"We are all proud of you," Kalam told scientists.
Singh later sent a message to scientists at the space centre that "you are preparing India to take to the 21st century in terms of advancements in science and technology".
It was the heaviest payload ever carried by the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, a version of which is planned for use by India's debut moon mission.
On the launch's eve, space scientists placed tiny replicas of the rocket and the two satellites at a Hindu shrine and prayed for the mission's success.
The biggest satellite, the 1.5 ton CARTOSAT 1, will supply high resolution pictures for more precise maps for planning towns, laying new roads, digging canals, disaster assessment and water resources management.
Among CARTOSAT's special features are two cameras that will provide stereo pictures to generate three dimensional maps.
Until now, Indian mapmakers have relied on combining satellite data to create three dimensional maps.
The cameras are designed to read images smaller than a car by identifying features down to 2.5 metres (eight foot four inches) wide.
The smaller 42.5 kilogram (94 pound) HAMSAT communications satellite will provide ultra high and very high radio frequencies to broaden bandwidth that Indian home operators had been seeking for years.
India has grabbed headlines with its commitment to send a probe to the moon in two or three years time.
But its space programme has mainly been aimed at harnessing high technology for its population of more than one billion, particularly its rural masses.
The CARTOSAT 1 is India's 11th remote sensing satellite on top of several broadcast satellites.
India's other remote sensing satellites supply information for use in irrigation, agriculture and disaster management.
India has the world's biggest civilian cluster of remote sensing satellites.
Thursday's blast off was the second since September when India launched Edusat, a distance learning satellite to allow teachers to broadcast primary and secondary classes to remote regions via television.
India is all set to launch PSLV C 6 from Sriharikota Space Center on May 5, New Delhi TV reported Monday.
This will be the first time two satellites will be launched in a single mission from India.
The first one is Cartosat I, a 1.5 ton remote sensing satellite which will send 3D images with 2.5 m resolution, crucial for the country's mapping and town planning.
The other is a microsatellite called Hamsat.
Expert believes this will usher in a revolution in Amateur Ham communication across South Asia.
India has also developed a first of its kind universal launching pad at a cost of 4 billion rupees.
Besides the present vehicle, all future generation vehicles of India Space Research Organization (ISRO) can be launched from this pad, saving huge costs and enabling frequent launching of satellites, the report said.
The countdown to the launch will begin on May 3.
With a track record of seven successive launches, ISRO is quite confident of a successful mission.
India and Russia are working on a satellite that will enable communication between youths of the two countries, Indo Asia News Service quoted President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam as saying in South India's Hyderabad Thursday.
"The (Indian) government has approved the design and development of a youth satellite and its launching in collaboration with Russia," Kalam said while interacting with students at a science congress in Hyderabad.
"Later, this facility will be made available to other countries as well," Kalam said.
The satellite would be launched by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).
India will launch more missions to the moon if its maiden unmanned spacecraft Chandrayaan 1, slated to be launched by 2008, is successful in mapping the lunar surface, a top space official said Tuesday.
"If there are good prospects for minerals then we will go for one or more robotic missions," said Madhavan Nair, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the country's premier space agency.
"It depends on the success of the first mission," said Nair, who was in the northern city of Udaipur to attend a five day global conference on "Exploration and Utilization of the Moon."
Nair said the two planned missions would be launched before 2015.
India's 590 kilogram (1298 pound) Chandrayaan 1, which will map the lunar terrain for minerals and conduct scientific experiments, will also carry an "impacter" module, Nair said.
The "impacter" weighing 20 kilograms will descend from the lunar orbit and touch the moon's surface to examine the surface more closely, he said.
"At the impact it will kick up some dust which our master control room will pick up through the mounted cameras and analyse.
It is an one shot affair," Nair explained.
The European Space Agency and National Aeronautics and Space Administration's X ray and laser equipment will ride piggyback on India's Chandrayaan 1.
The ISRO chief called on the international community to draw a roadmap for future space programmes.
"International cooperation and collaboration is needed rather than competition, which exists today, to share space on an equitable basis.
All the five nations should join hands to minimise costs," Nair said.
The United States, the European Space Agency, China, Japan and India are all planning lunar missions during the next decade.
The conference being attended by more than 200 delegates from 16 countries will draft a declaration on Friday underlining future cooperation in space programmes.
Afghanistan's public health minister asked Indian officials on Friday to help bring modern health care to his war ravaged nation, officials said.
Afghanistan will set up a countrywide network of "telemedicine" centers with the help of India's space agency, the Indian Space Research Organization, said Abdul Salam Jalali, a member of the delegation.
Telemedicine centers are located in areas where hospitals don't exist or specialists are not available.
They are equipped with a computer, video camera, clinical equipment and a satellite connection which allow doctors in another location to examine patients.
He said Afghan Public Health Minister Syed Mohammed Amin Fatimie held talks with officials of India's health and family welfare ministry and visited hospitals in New Delhi.
"Two and a half decades of war and internal fighting have destroyed our infrastructure, including health care facilities," Jalali said in the southern city of Bangalore.
In the first phase, Afghanistan will set up telemedicine centers in 11 cities, including Kabul, Kandahar and Mazar e Sharif, Jalali said.
The first center in Kabul will become operational in early 2006, he said.
Jalali, also the director of the Indira Gandhi Institute for child health, a hospital in Kabul set up with Indian assistance, said Afghanistan lacks specialists to provide advanced medical care in several disciplines.
Afghan hospitals are in talks with several Indian hospitals to enable these patients to get treated in India at affordable rates, he said.
Federal prosecutors investigating the smuggling of nuclear technology disclosed Friday that a South African businessman has pleaded guilty to arranging illegal exports of American made equipment both to Pakistan and its regional rival, India.
Asher Karni, an Israeli who lives in South Africa, entered the guilty plea in September and has been cooperating with investigators, prosecutors said.
The prosecutors kept the proceeding secret until Friday, however, when they unsealed the plea agreement and charges they have brought against Humayun Khan, an Islamabad businessman with longstanding ties to Pakistan's military.
Khan is said to be Karni's partner.
As part of Karni's plea agreement, he acknowledged that he also was involved in 2002 in selling sophisticated electronic equipment to government agencies in India, some of which are involved in nuclear weapons and missile research.
It is not clear whether the goods he sold were useful for making nuclear weapons.
The disclosures in the two cases shed additional light on the black market trade in nuclear related equipment to countries regarded as proliferation risks.
They provide new details on the smuggling operations and, for the first time, indicate that India, as well as Pakistan, sought at least some banned equipment.
Khan's indictment states that he employed Karni in 2002 and 2003 to purchase 200 high speed electrical switches that can be used in a nuclear device, as well as oscilloscopes, and to export them to Pakistan without the required U.S. export licenses.
The switches, known as triggered spark gaps, are used in medical equipment but also have military applications, including as detonators for nuclear weapons, the prosecutors said.
Khan is believed to be in Pakistan and a Pakistani embassy official said he was unaware of an American request to have him detained.
Efforts to reach Khan on Friday were unsuccessful, but in interviews, including one with The New York Times in 2004, he has denied smuggling American made triggers to Pakistan.
Because of the large number of triggers sought, American officials said they strongly suspected the devices were intended for government agencies involved in nuclear weapons work in Pakistan and possibly other countries seeking nuclear weapons.
Several U.S. officials said that they have not been able to tie the Pakistani government directly to the trigger purchases.
A senior Commerce Department official said Friday that, with Karni's help, the investigation has turned up indications that Khan was involved in sales of nuclear related technology to countries other than Pakistan using a network of suppliers and middlemen similar to that used by A.Q Khan, the Pakistani nuclear scientist who confessed in 2004 to providing nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea for more than a decade.
The two Khans are not believed to be related, officials said.
"Humayun Khan is a black marketeer involved in the proliferation of nuclear weapons and once this is all spelled out we're going to see the same scale of network that A.Q. Khan was involved in," said the Commerce Department official.
The official would not identify countries other than Pakistan that the United States suspects of involvement with Humayun Khan.
Mohammad Sadiq, deputy chief of mission at Pakistan's embassy in Washington, denied that Humayun Khan was involved in procuring triggers or other equipment for its nuclear program.
"I'm not aware of why Humayun Khan was buying these," Sadiq said.
"The government of Pakistan has nothing to do with this, that is for sure."
American investigators have not been able to interview Khan in person, they said.
Sadiq said he was not aware that any formal request to question Khan had been made by U.S. authorities.
Karni, the Israeli businessman who worked with Khan, was arrested in Denver in 2004 after traveling to the United States with his family for a vacation.
Karni ran a company called Top Cape Technology from Cape Town, South Africa.
Karni's relationship with Khan began in 2002 when the Pakistani asked him to buy an oscilloscope manufactured by Tektronix Inc. of Beaverton, Ore., according to the documents released on Friday.
Such devices display graphs of electric signals and have numerous applications, including in weapons research.
He warned Karni to "approach these cases carefully as all items are controlled," according to an e mail message quoted in Khan's indictment, which says that Karni eventually shipped three oscilloscopes to Pakistani companies that were clients of Khan.
In 2003, Khan sent an e mail message seeking triggered spark gaps and advising Khan not to "disclose the end destination."
In July of that year, an unidentified informant tipped off Commerce Department and customs agents about Karni's activities.
The American supplier, Perkin Elmer Optoelectronics of Salem, Mass., agreed to cooperate in the case, sending 66 disabled triggers in a shipment to Pakistan, routed through South Africa and the United Arab Emirates.
In one transaction, Karni was asked by Humtek Communications in Bangalore, India, to buy electrical components for India's Space Applications Center, which works on rockets and is barred from receiving advanced American technology.
The space agencies of India and France signed an agreement on Friday to cooperate in launching a satellite in four years that will help make climate predictions more accurate.
The project, named Megha Tropiques, "is a major milestone in the long standing relationship between Indian and French space agencies," G. Madhavan Nair, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization, said in a statement.
ISRO and the French National Space Center, known by its French acronym CNES, signed the memorandum of understanding following five years of talks.
ISRO will build the satellite, launch it sometime between April 2008 and March 2009, and control the spacecraft in space.
CNES will build the scientific instruments that will observe atmospheric conditions and send back data.
ISRO will spend about US$24 million (euro18.6 million), while CNES will contribute US$62 million (euro48 million) to the mission, the agencies said.
The satellite will track tropical atmospheric conditions, such as rain above oceans, monsoon patterns, humidity, water vapor and radiation, that have an impact on global climatic changes.
"These systems interact with the general atmospheric circulation in ways we still do not fully understand one reason why weather forecasts and predictions of climatic events such as cyclones, monsoons, flooding and drought are not more accurate," CNES said.
"The Megha Tropiques mission will improve our understanding of these processes," it said.

India's space agency is ready to send a man to space within seven years if the government gives the nod, while preparations have already begun for the launch of an unmanned lunar mission, a top official said.
Madhavan Nair, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the country's premier space agency, said the scientific community in the country had already started a debate on the manned mission.
"The question of a manned mission is glaring before us now," Nair told AFP ahead of a lunar conference which kicks off in the northern Indian city of Udaipur on Monday.
"The thought process has begun and various agencies have come up with ideas.
Whether it is now or later is a question to be considered," Nair said.
"We have not taken it up to the government level yet.
But if we are asked to ,and are given adequate funding, we can achieve it in six to seven years from today," he said.
India sent its first astronaut, Rakesh Sharma, aboard Soviet spacecraft Salyut 7 in April 1984 while another astronaut, Kalpana Chawla, was killed along with six others in the Columbia shuttle disaster in February last year.
Nair said "a lot of debate" had to take place in India before a final decision is taken on a manned space flight.
"The benefits and the costs involved have to be examined.
Various facilities and equipment such as a space capsule for human habitation, shielding, control and safety features have to be built a large amount of funding is required," he said.
India's unmanned lunar flight, Chandrayaan (Moon Journey), slated to launch by the end of 2007 or early 2008, was on schedule, Nair said.
"The design work for Chandrayaan has been completed and we are in the phase of implementing various types of prototypes," he said.
"Building instruments and calibrating them to match exact conditions on the moon is a big challenge.
"We do not expect any difficulty with respect to the spacecraft and launch vehicle.
The acquisition of land for deep space exploration has also been completed.
Things are progressing well for the targetted launch latest by early 2008," he said.
The mission, to place a 525 kilogram (1125 pound) orbiter using an indigenously built polar satellite launch vehicle, is slated to cost the agency 83 million dollars.
The satellite will go around the polar orbit about 100 kilometers (62 miles) above the moon.
Critics have slammed the mission saying it is outdated and the organisation was wasting its money from a limited budget of 25 billion rupees (543 million dollars) allotted by the government.
They say cash strapped India should not undertake the mission but instead restrict its space programmes to satellite launches and use its funds for social welfare.
But ISRO chief Nair defended the mission and said it would spur the Indian scientconference in Udaipur is being attended by about 200 Indian and foreign delegates from countries such as the United States, Europe, Japan, Russia and China.
The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has short listed experiments from five nations including the United States, Britain and Germany, for a slot on India's unmanned moon mission Chandrayaan 1 to be undertaken by 2006 2007, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Monday.
"We have short listed scientific experiments from researchers in five countries US, UK, Sweden, Bulgaria and Germany.
We will finalize the right partners by December," PTI quoted ISRO sources as saying in Bangalore in south India.
India plans to put a 525 kg orbiter using Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket 100 km over the moon to explore the earth's satellite.
ISRO had allotted 10 kgs and 10 watts of power for space agencies of other nations and had invited international bids for the purpose that had evoked 15 responses from 10 nations.
"The best suited proposals have been short listed.
We have to find out whether they finally fit into our mission payload," the sources said.
India's mission is aimed at expanding the scientific knowledge about the moon, upgrading India's technological capability and providing challenging opportunities for planetary research to the younger generation.
ISRO officials said a three dimensional atlas of regions of scientific interest of the moon will be mapped with instruments on board the mission, besides exploring the lunar surface for elements such as magnesium, aluminium, silicon, calcium, iron and titanium.
A three member Afghan delegation is in Bangalore seeking help to set up a high tech telemedicine facility in 10 Afghan cities linked via Indian satellites, Indo Asian News Service reported Saturday.
The satellite based networks that will be established later this year with the help of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) will offer connectivity to major hospitals in India to improve healthcare in the war ravaged country.
An ISRO team will visit Afghanistan soon to install the network at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Chid Health (IGICH) which will be linked with New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).
After the recent visits of Afghan President Hamid Karzai to Delhi and Indian foreign minister K. Natwar Singh to Kabul last month, the Afghan health ministry decided to upgrade IGICH with a polyclinic, a diagnostic center and a surgical block, IGICH director Abdul Salam Jalali told media.
After the telemedicine network becomes operational in Kabul, the ISRO and the Afghan health ministry will jointly work on expanding the facility to other provinces.
Afghanistan has a population of 23 25 million, a majority of the people scattered in semi urban and rural areas where public health system has remained neglected due to the quarter century of strife, civil war and Talibanization, Jalali recalled.
India is "a step ahead" of China in satellite technology and can surpass Beijing in space research by tapping the talent of its huge pool of young scientists, India's space research chief said Monday.
G Madhavan Nair said India and China were "on par (with each other) as far as rocket technology is concerned," the Press Trust of India news agency reported.
Though China was ahead in planning a manned mission to the moon, "We are a step ahead of China in satellite technology," Nair, chief of the Indian Space Research Organisation, told a gathering in the southern city of Coimbatore.
Two years ago, India announced it would launch a mission to the moon the Chandrayan I or Moon Vehicle I by 2007.
The 590 kilogram (1298 pound) Chandrayan 1 is expected to map the lunar terrain for minerals and conduct scientific experiments.
The 2007 mission also aims at landing a small probe an "impacter" module weighing about 20 kilograms (44 pounds) on the surface of the moon.
Besides India, the United States, the European Space Agency, China and Japan are planning lunar missions during the next decade.
An ambitious telemedicine system to connect through satellite doctors of some of the best hospitals across India with patients in Jharkhand will be launched, according to Indo Asian News Agency.
The Jharkhand Space Application Center (JSAC) of the Information Technology Department has proposed the telemedicine system to help poor people avail of diagnostic facilities from good hospitals.
The 130 million rupees (2.9 million US dollars) project will be launched with the help of the Indian Space Research Organization ( ISRO).
Bangalore based ISRO will provide satellite connectivity infrastructure to JSCA, like bandwidth and VSAT facilities and hardware.
"Under the telemedicine system, villagers will get the advice of doctors of renowned hospitals without having to shift to any place," said an official of the IT Department.
It would benefit the state's 54 percent population living below the poverty line ( BPL).
The state has a population of 26.91 million.
"Doctors within and outside the state will be made available to rural people through mobile vans.
It will cover the remotest areas of the state," said R.S Sharma, IT secretary of Jharkhand.
The project will be a joint venture of the IT and health and family welfare departments of the state with the expense being shared among them.
The project has been designed to cover three phases.
In the first phase, seven district hospitals, one mobile van and two medical college hospitals would be connected through e health of the IT Department.
In the second phase, eight district hospitals and one mobile van would be added, while in the third phase seven district hospitals, one medical hospital and one mobile van would be connected.
All the 22 district hospitals, three medical hospitals and three mobile vans would be connected with master control facility located at the state capital Ranchi.
A specialized center would come up in every district hospital with facilities like video conferencing, telemedicine software and hardware, communication system, diagnostic equipment and medical equipment.
The mobile vans would also have video conferencing facilities.
The U.S. space agency NASA is in talks with its Indian counterpart on whether to take part in New Delhi's first unmanned moon mission set for 2007, an official said Saturday.
NASA plans to put two sets of imaging equipment aboard India's spacecraft to study the moon's surface, said G. Madhavan Nair, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization, or ISRO.
"The talks are on," he said.
"It is an opportunity we are looking forward to."
NASA plans to outfit the Indian craft with a radar device that can map the moon's terrain, as well as a special camera able to take high resolution pictures, Nair said.
India's lunar mission, named Chandrayan 1, involves sending a 525 kilograms (1157 pound) satellite a polar orbit 62 miles (100 kilometers) above the moon's surface.
The orbiter is expected to last two years.
The mission is intended to develop a chemical map of the moon, with a three dimensional atlas of specific regions such as the polar zones, that have high interest to scientists, Nair said.
At India's invitation, European countries including Bulgaria have decided to place experimental equipment aboard the orbiter.
Meanwhile, ISRO plans to flight test India's newly developed cryogenic rocket engine later this year, Nair said.
Cryogenic engines work on the principle that more fuel can be stored in a limited space if the fuel's temperature is at an extremely low temperature.
That would enable users to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles or place heavy communication satellites into orbit 36000 kilometers (22370 miles) from Earth.
Only a few countries including the United States, Russia and France have so far been able to build cryogenic engines.
"Results from our ground tests have been good so far," Nair said.
"We are now developing the launch vehicle with a cryogenic engine."
ISRO's plans to develop its own cryogenic engine were delayed after it tested nuclear weapons in 1998, prompting the United States to impose sanctions and to pressure Russia, India's traditional ally, not transfer the technology for such engines.
A judge in this conservative area of Eastern Washington on Monday rejected claims by Republicans that fraud and illegal votes wrongly put a Democrat, Christine O. Gregoire, in the governor's office, and in response the Republican candidate, Dino Rossi, said he would end his five month legal effort to remove her.
Rossi's decision came as a surprise because his lawyers had long said they expected to the case to be appealed to the state's Supreme Court if they lost.
A spokeswoman for Rossi attributed his decision to the forcefulness of the ruling, issued by Judge John E. Bridges of Chelan Country Superior Court.
An appeal "just wasn't going to be possible, and it was time to end it," said the spokeswoman, Mary Lane.
In his ruling, Bridges said lawyers for Rossi had failed to meet their burden of proof, providing no "clear and convincing" evidence that illegal votes were responsible for Gregoire's 129 vote victory over Rossi last year.
It was the closest race in the state's history.
"There is no evidence in this record that Ms Gregoire received any illegal votes," Bridges said in a ruling that had been eagerly awaited by each side.
Bridges noted that the only illegal votes that had been proved during the trial were five cast by convicted felons, four were for Rossi, and one was for a Libertarian candidate, Ruth Bennett.
Although Bridges cited widespread errors in the election, particularly in King County, the state's most populous and liberal county, he said it was plain that those human errors did not amount to fraud.
"There is no evidence that the significant errors that occurred resulted from intentional misconduct or someone's desire to manipulate the election," he said.
The ruling left Democrats euphoric.
Gregoire said in a statement that it was "great news."
After Rossi announced that he was dropping the case, her spokeswoman, Althea Cawley Murphree, said, "She's very pleased that this is finally something that the whole state can put behind us."
Other Democrats painted Rossi as a sore loser who had wasted taxpayer time and money on a frivolous lawsuit.
"The Republicans never had a case," said Paul Berendt, the chairman of the state Democratic Party.
"There was no fraud, there were no serious irregularities."
Berendt argued that the lawsuit was more about trying to burnish Rossi's image at the expense of Gregoire.
"They have shown that they will say anything, they will spend anything and they will do anything to tear down Christine, and that needs to stop," he said.
Dale Foreman, a lawyer for the Republicans, rejected that accusation.
"We filed an election contest because we felt the election was unfair," he said.
In the election, the more than 2.8 million ballots cast were counted three times.
The first two tallies gave Rossi a victory by very small margins that shrank from one count to the next, and the final count, conducted by hand, put Gregoire in office.
Republicans claimed in court to have identified 754 votes cast by felons, but they could not prove that even one had cast an illegal ballot for Gregoire, largely, Foreman said, because they did not interview the felons about which way they voted.
Democrats did interview some of the felons, providing depositions from five of them, including the four who said they voted for Rossi.
It hasn't been much of a political honeymoon for Gov. Christine Gregoire.
In a normal political atmosphere, she would have been guaranteed time to convince voters that the 9.5 cent a gallon gasoline tax increase she pushed through the legislature a few days ago was the right thing to do.
Before being asked to cast their ballots again, voters might have seen the fruits of her plan to ease the Puget Sound region's mind boggling transportation problems.
But this isn't a normal political world.
Since Washington state voters went to the polls in November, Gregoire routinely has awakened to headlines about mishandled ballots, deceased voters and what the alternative Seattle Weekly recently called "the election that won't die."
Her erstwhile challenger, Republican Dino Rossi, is suing to get the election overturned.
Many legal experts say that when his case goes to trial May 23, the Republicans certainly have a shot at getting an unprecedented revote.
The number of ballots that have come under question far exceeds Gregoire's 129 vote margin of victory.
If their race were a 100 yard dash, the distance between them at the finish line was barely one third of an inch.
The post election fight has become what state Republican chairman Chris Vance calls "the legal equivalent of Gettysburg."
Both parties have spent millions of dollars on legal challenges and, in fact, U.S. Sen John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, last year's Democratic presidential nominee, is scheduled to fly here Sunday to help raise money for Gregoire's cause.Through it all, however, even the governor's detractors say she has remained remarkably focused.
In the just ended legislative session, Gregoire managed to achieve most of her stated goals including passage of her $8.5 billion transportation plan.
She has made nearly all of her major personnel appointments, and says she is confident of prevailing in the legal battle ahead.
"I cannot and, in fact, I refuse to get distracted by what is going on (in the legal case)," Gregoire, 58, said in an interview in Tacoma.
"My philosophy is, the only thing I can do is to be a good governor."
Gregoire was sworn in in January, just days after state elections officials certified her victory after a hand recount of all 2.9 million ballots.
Before that, two machine recounts had given Rossi a 42 vote lead.
If a revote happens, said Gregoire, a former state attorney general, "I'll deal with it.
But frankly, I can't see getting there."
Plenty of election law experts here agree with her.
Washington courts have never ordered a statewide revote, they say, and Gregoire appears to have followed the recount provisions to a T.
Recent polls also suggest that Gregoire has prevailed in the court of public opinion: A majority of Washingtonians now oppose a revote, which Rossi says is the only fair way to settle the matter.
One dynamic in any future Gregoire Rossi matchup, however, will have changed profoundly: Gregoire now has a record to run on.
While Democrats say the governor has accomplished much in a short time, Republicans call her a thief, or "Gov. Fraudoire," and say she has resorted to big spending, tax hiking Democratic ways.
"For good or for bad, she'll be running as an incumbent," said Stuart Elway, a Seattle based pollster.
"Rossi's campaign will be: 'See, I told you nothing would change if she became governor, and nothing did.
They just raised taxes again.'
He'll run the same campaign, only this time with an exclamation mark."
A spokeswoman for Rossi, a former state senator, called the election "a giant mess."
"At this point," said Mary Lane "not even Christine Gregoire can continue to say with a straight face that ,anyone can know with certainty who won."
It is also impossible to know, Elway said, whether in a revote the electorate would focus on the gas, tobacco and state estate tax increases passed under Gregoire or give the Democrat controlled legislature credit for tackling big problems.
Those include reconstruction of Seattle's Alaskan Way Viaduct, which was damaged in a 2000 earthquake, and replacement of the busy Highway 520 bridge over Lake Washington that connects Seattle with its eastern suburbs.
"Transportation is on top of the charts of issues that people want resolved," Elway said.
"So if the sense coming out of this session is: 'We're finally doing something about it,' it could be a huge plus for her.
"But these projects have such a long lead time," Elway said, "and in the meantime people are not going to be happy about these new taxes."
(Begin optional trim) Gregoire plans to travel around the state in the coming days for a series of public bill signings where she will tout the passage of legislation that expanded health coverage for nearly 20000 poor children, increased enrollment and tuition aid at public universities and created a $1 billion fund for biomedical and agricultural research.
As a public speaker, political watchers here said, Gregoire can come off as somewhat wooden and controlled, although she routinely is described as funny and warm in more personal settings.
"My frustration is, did people get to know me (during the November election)," the governor said.
"I don't think they did."
(End optional trim) In the November election, Gregoire targeted issues in her television ads without talking much about her life: She is the daughter of a single mother who said she fled an abusive relationship and raised her child while working as a short order cook.
The governor herself is the mother of two accomplished daughters, the wife of a Vietnam War veteran, a breast cancer survivor and a three term attorney general who helped lead the landmark tobacco litigation that brought tens of billions of dollars to the states.
Rossi, in contrast, ran an ad campaign that featured his children and described how he'd worked as a young man polishing floors at the Space Needle.
Since being sworn in, Gregoire said, she has received support from around the country.
"All I get is, 'We are so proud of you, you are courageous, you are strong," she said, describing the letters and e mails.
"People somehow or another have seen what happened here as kind of the model (for the way disputed elections should be resolved)."
But former U.S. Sen Slade Gorton, R Wash. who was ousted in 2000 by Democrat Maria Cantwell in another bitterly close race recently blasted King County officials for having what he called "the worst elections administration of any county in the United States of America."
Ballots from King County, where Seattle is located, gave Gregoire her edge in the final recount.
They have been the focus of charges that dead people, felons, ineligible provisional voters and others who should have been struck from the polls all got to vote.
Democrats have a different view, saying that problem ballots occur in virtually every statewide election and that the real news is how well the vast majority of ballots were counted.
State Democratic Party chairman Paul Berendt called the 2004 vote "the most accurate election in state history."
During a recent call in television program, Gregoire told one state resident: "I really wish we could move on."
Being governor, she said, is a 24/7 job, and "I'm doing what I would've done if I had won by a landslide."
A trial to determine whether the results of Washington state's gubernatorial election last fall should be thrown out opened with Republicans charging Democrats "stole" the contest for Christine Gregoire, who won by 129 votes out of 2.9 million cast.
The Republicans want Dino Rossi declared the winner or a do over election held.
"This is a case of election fraud," Republican attorney Dale Foreman said in his opening statement in the trial, which is being heard by a Superior Court judge without a jury.
"This election was stolen from the legal voters of this state by a bizarre combination of illegal voters and bungling bureaucrats."
Democratic attorney Kevin Hamilton argued Republicans lack the "serious proof" they need to make their case and justify the removal of the governor.
He also said the Republicans' belated claim of fraud demonstrates "desperation" on their part.
"Imperfection is not enough to overturn an election," Hamilton said.
"It's not enough to throw a lot of dust in the air and make allegations."
Foreman surprised the court with a new claim: that the Democrats rigged the election by stuffing ballot boxes in Gregoire's two strongest precincts and by "losing" votes in two of Rossi's strongest precincts.
The findings in Seattle's heavily Democratic King County show "partisan bias and not random error," Foreman said.
"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck."
Up to now, the Republicans have largely complained of bungling rather than outright fraud on the part of election officials.
Chelan County Superior Court Judge John Bridges ruled that Republican lawyers could present evidence about possible fraudulent actions during the nine day trial, though he said the court "does not believe there is a fraud causation element to this case."
Rossi, a former state senator and commercial real estate agent, won the first count last year by 261 votes and a machine recount by 42 votes.
But during a hand recount of 2.9 million ballots, the Democratic stronghold of Seattle made Gregoire, a former attorney general, the winner by 129 votes.
Gregoire was inaugurated in January amid protests from Rossi supporters.
Neither Gregoire nor Rossi planned to attend the trial.
They still answer the phone "Rossi for Governor" at the suburban office where Republican Dino Rossi runs the campaign that has yet to die.
And the candidate has hardly been in exile making speeches, attending fundraisers and counting the days until he gets his shot in court at unseating the woman who beat him by 129 votes last November.
"I'm going to be governor sooner or later," Rossi said.
"I'm working on sooner."
He may get his best chance starting Monday, when a two week trial is scheduled to begin before Judge John Bridges of Chelan County Superior Court, in the apple country east of the Cascade Mountains.
Republicans have sued to overturn the results of the gubernatorial election, which Christine Gregoire, the Democratic candidate, won after two recounts and about 2.9 million ballots cast.
The trial will center on human and machine error in the thinnest of margins: the 0.07 percent of the vote that is being contested because felons or other illegal voters might have cast ballots.
The judge has set a high bar before he will consider throwing out the November results and ordering a new election, or handing a victory to Rossi.
The Republicans will have to prove that Rossi received more votes than Gregoire, after deducting hundreds of supposedly illegal votes, the judge has indicated.
It is a case that will pit one list of felons against another, both sides have tallied hundreds of illegal voters.
But there is no way to know whom those people voted for, short of calling them all to the witness stand.
So while Republicans will argue that most of the felons voted in the heavily Democratic King County, and therefore should be deducted proportionally from Gregoire's total, the Democrats will counter with their own experts who say that felons in the state tend to vote Republican.
"The Republican base has always been nonunion, white, blue collar males, and that's who the felons are in the state of Washington," said Paul Berendt, chairman of the state's Democratic Party.
At the root of both arguments is an assumption that illegal voters follow the same political pattern as legal voters a challenging legal proposition for throwing out an election, according to election officials elsewhere.
Gregoire said in an interview that if the courts were to rule based on "guessing" which way voters would go because of past patterns, it would set a dangerous precedent.
"If this type of argument is allowed to stand," she said, "you would have no end to the challenges and trolling for illegal votes after a close election.
Elections would go on and on and on."
Gregoire said she was confident of winning in court.
But Rossi was equally upbeat about his chances, even while acknowledging that the proportional analysis argument is not perfect.
"This is the closest we'll get to figuring out the intent of these ballots," he said in an interview.
"But if you allowed illegal votes to stand, that would be worse."
Rossi also said the Republicans had done a better job of finding people who should not have voted because their registrations were never taken off the books after their criminal convictions.
"The difference between their felons and ours is we have all the documentation," he said.
"What you're going to see is that a lot of their names won't stick once you throw them up against the wall."
Republicans are also arguing that fraud occurred, pointing to errors made in counting, sorting and certifying ballots in King County, which includes Seattle.
Democrats say errors are always a small part of the election process and are not evidence of willful fraud.
"The elections people have no idea how many people actually voted in King County, but they say their tally is close enough," said Chris Vance, chairman of the state's Republican Party.
"Well, excuse me, but close enough for government work doesn't count in deciding who the governor is."
Rossi and Gregoire have been trying to buttress their images as they wage their seemingly unending campaigns.
Gregoire, the former Washington State attorney general who led the states in their legal settlement with the tobacco companies in the late 1990s, has governed as if she had a big mandate.
The Legislature, which is controlled by the Democrats, passed more bills this year than in any session in recent history and raised gas taxes for $8.5 billion in transportation projects.
"People have asked me if I would govern any differently if I'd won by a million votes, and the answer is no," Gregoire said.
"There is nothing I can do about the lawsuit, so I need to stay focused on the business of the state."
Rossi has tried not to act like a governor in exile, he said, and has rarely second guessed Gregoire.
A former real estate investor and state senator, Rossi now works full time trying to overturn the election.
Until last week, he had maintained a relatively low profile.
Polls show that Rossi's approval rating has risen, while Gregoire's has fallen.
And Rossi has been careful not to appear as a sore loser, leaving it to Republican Party officials to throw the sharpest punches.
Vance, for example, calls Gregoire "our fake governor."
In addition, conservative talk radio shows and the blogosphere are crowded with critics who have hammered Gregoire while praising Rossi as a victim of sloppy or criminal election processing.
But there is also considerable evidence that the public has grown tired of the contested election and want to move on.
Stuart Elway, an independent pollster, said that his latest survey, of 400 registered voters in March, showed that a nearly two to one majority wanted to accept the vote rather than hold a new election.
Elway's survey had a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.
"In December, most people did not accept her as governor," Elway said of Gregoire.
"Now most people have, and they want to move on."
Washington, like many states, is polarized between its Democratic urban centers and Republican rural and suburban areas.
Leading up to this week's trial, Republicans have turned up the heat on King County, trying to show that the Democratic heavy Seattle metro area has an incompetent elections divisions.
Rossi has enlisted the help of Slade Gorton, the former Republican senator who was ousted by a narrow margin five years ago by Maria Cantwell, primarily because of large Democratic turnout in King County.
In a news conference, Gorton said King County "had the worst election administration of any county in the United States."
But Democrats, who were once united in defending the county's election operations, now say they plan to use evidence of mistakes to help their case.
They say that several hundred ballots, which are likely to favor Gregoire, were never counted because King County officials did not adequately try to verify them.
Berendt, the Democratic Party chairman, said, "We have a basic belief that we're going to lay out in court that the problems in King County hurt Gregoire more than they hurt Rossi."
Rejecting claims that fraud and illegal votes wrongly put a Democrat in the governor's office, a judge in this conservative area of eastern Washington dismissed a Republican lawsuit on Monday that had sought to overturn the election of Gov. Christine Gregoire.
The judge, John E. Bridges of Chelan County Superior Court, said lawyers for the Republican candidate, Dino Rossi, had failed to meet their burden of proof, providing no "clear and convincing" evidence that illegal votes were responsible for Gregoire's 129 vote victory over Rossi last year.
It was the closest race in the state's history.
"There is no evidence in this record that Ms Gregoire received any illegal votes," Bridges said in a ruling that had been eagerly awaited by each side and seemed likely to be appealed to the state Supreme Court.
Bridges noted that the only illegal votes that had been proved during the trial were five cast by convicted felons, four were for Rossi, and one was for a Libertarian candidate, Ruth Bennett.
Although Bridges cited widespread errors in the election, particularly in King County, the state's most populous and liberal county, he said it was plain that those human errors did not amount to fraud.
"There is no evidence that the significant errors that occurred resulted from intentional misconduct or someone's desire to manipulate the election," he said.
The ruling left Democrats euphoric.
Gregoire, in a statement, called the ruling "great news," and said she hoped it meant that, almost five months after her inauguration, "we can put this election behind us."
Other Democrats painted Rossi as a sore loser who had wasted taxpayer time and money on a frivolous lawsuit.
"The Republicans never had a case," said Paul Berendt, the chairman of the state Democratic Party.
"There was no fraud, there were no serious irregularities."
Berendt argued that the lawsuit was more about trying to burnish Rossi's image at the expense of Gregoire.
"They have shown that they will say anything, they will spend anything and they will do anything to tear down Christine, and that needs to stop," he said.
Dale Foreman, a lawyer for the Republicans, rejected that accusation.
"We filed an election contest because we felt the election was unfair," he said.
In the election, the more than 2.8 million ballots cast were counted three times.
The first two tallies gave Rossi a victory by very small margins that shrank from one count to the next, and the final count, conducted by hand, put Gregoire in office.
Republicans claimed in court to have identified 754 votes cast by felons, but they could not prove that even one had cast an illegal ballot for Gregoire, largely, Foreman said, because they did not interview the felons about which way they voted.
Democrats did interview some of the felons, providing depositions from five of them, including the four who said they voted for Rossi.
The swearing in ceremony here that made the Democrat Christine A. Gregoire the new governor of Washington on Wednesday after one of the closest elections in history had all the somber ritualistic touches, complete with prayers and bagpipes wailing "God Bless America."
But outside, on the airwaves, on billboards and in statements made by Republicans, Gregoire's hold on the office was questioned even as she gave her inauguration speech.
Republicans and their candidate, Dino Rossi, have sued to overturn the election, which Gregoire won by 129 votes after two recounts.
The court case, filed in a Republican leaning county, will most likely be settled only when this state's Supreme Court weighs in.
Republicans say the election was flawed because of irregularities in the biggest and most Democratic county, while Gregoire supporters say the problems were not unusual for a large turnout, and did not change the outcome.
But Washington's state constitution has no specific provision on a revote, leaving leaders of both parties struggling over the high ground of public esteem as the politics of the state enters a legal frontier.
For Republicans, that means building a base of discontented voters using their allies in conservative talk radio and the building industry.
As Gregoire was giving her speech, the Building Industry Association of Washington ran radio advertisements saying, "We don't even know who our legitimate governor is."
They were backed by conservative radio hosts, who helped to organize a rally of about 2500 opponents to Gregoire here on Tuesday.
They called on legislators to delay the swearing in while the court heard the legal challenge.
The motion was defeated along party lines.
For Democrats, the new campaign means trying to build a base of majority popular support for Gregoire, should a new vote occur.
In her inaugural speech, Gregoire, the former state attorney general, struck a conciliatory tone, reaching out to Rossi and calling for election reform.
She announced a task force, chaired by Secretary of State Sam Reed, a Republican, to review the state's election process.
In her speech, before a packed house in the Capitol rotunda, Gregoire recalled her blue collar background, thanked her mother a "short order cook" and her parish priest, who gave a prayer.
She talked about her survival from breast cancer, and praised her husband, a Vietnam veteran.
"Many have asked how I can govern without a clear mandate from voters," she said.
"I believe the voters have given us a mandate a mandate to overcome our differences and to solve problems."
After the speech, Republican leaders tried to walk a line between acknowledging Gregoire as governor and saying it was not quite over.
"The fact is we will never know who really won this election," said Rep Bruce Chandler, in giving the Republican response.
"That's very disconcerting."
Republicans said their party base is angry, and not willing to give up.
At the Tuesday rally, Republicans chanted "Re vote!
Re vote!," while Democrats, in a much smaller rally, held signs that read, "Don't waste our tax $ on your hurt feelings."
The leader of the Republican minority in the Senate, Bill Finkbeiner, seemed to take a small step toward reconciliation.
"She's now the governor of Washington state and we're ready to work with her," he said.
"In the meantime, this is going to be sorted out."
What happens next is uncertain.
Democrats said the court could throw out the results, but any remedy would be in the Legislature.
A Democratic leader in the House, Rep Helen Sommers, also said it would be uncharted territory for a court to order a new election.
Among the questions are whether there would be a primary, or whether third party candidates could run.
A Libertarian candidate received more than 60000 votes in the race, more than enough to tip the balance.
"If the court were to set aside the result, I assume they would direct the Legislature to find a remedy," said Sommers.
"But I don't even think a court could set it aside."
Republicans have not detailed any plans on how a new election would take place.
They circulated an online petition, and with their allies in industry, have backed an electronic billboard message for a re vote, which flashes along Interstate 5.
Rossi led after the initial count of the votes and in the first recount, performed by machine, and lost in the second performed manually.
At nightfall, both sides appeared ready to put differences aside for the inaugural ball, even as they said it could be the only semblance of a honeymoon for Gregoire.
In a defeat for Democrats as they defend Gov. Christine O. Gregoire from a Republican lawsuit that challenges her election, a judge said on Friday that his courtroom, not the Democratic controlled Legislature, was the proper forum to investigate the contest.
The ruling thrilled Republicans who have been pushing to remove Gregoire since December, when she was declared the winner by 129 votes out of nearly 3 million cast.
The race, unusual in its tiny margin of victory and the bitterness it has prompted, featured three official counts, only the last of which went in Gregoire's favor.
Persistent Republican accusations of serious flaws in the ballot counting and recounting led to the suit.
The suit, seeking a revote, has been under way in Chelan County, east of Seattle, since Jan 7.
"We are very pleased with this ruling," said Mary Lane, a spokeswoman for the Republican candidate, Dino Rossi, who has become something of a governor in exile among his supporters.
"This election contest can move forward, which is very good news."
At the packed hearing before Judge John E. Bridges of Chelan County Superior Court, whom a Democratic governor appointed in 1988, a cryptic sentence from the state constitution kept being repeated, first by Democratic lawyers who argued that it meant that the Legislature should decide the case, and then by Republican lawyers, who argued that it meant that the courts should decide, and finally the judge as he ruled.
The sentence, which is 116 years old, says contested races for governor "shall be decided by the Legislature in such a manner as shall be determined by law."
Until Friday, its meaning had never been parsed by a state court, Bridges said.
Surrounded by the thick white binders filled with briefing materials from the two parties and complaining wryly of a lack of sleep from all the reading, Bridges ruled that the Legislature had, through a longstanding state law, already delegated the authority to hear election contests to the state's courts.
Thus, "by law," he ruled, the Legislature had given him the authority to hear the case.
Republicans had originally named more than 80 defendants in the case, including officials in all 39 Washington counties.
Later in the day, Bridges ruled in favor of the Democrats and several of the counties on motions to dismiss all county officials from the suit, saying the number of defendants was unwieldy and unnecessary.
That took the number of defendants down to three, chief among them Secretary of State Sam Reed, a Republican.
Democrats said they were not surprised by the rulings and were happy that the Republicans would be required to prove their case within the confines of the election law, a process that could take some time and be much like putting the election on trial.
"This is going about the way we expected," a lawyer for the Democrats, David McDonald, said.
"If you've got to decide this case under the election contest statute, these guys are in trouble."
One of the closest and most bizarre elections of any state in U.S. history may have finally come to a close Thursday, nearly two months after ballots were cast.
Or maybe it didn't.
Democrat Christine Gregoire was certified Thursday as the governor elect, after losing two machine read vote counts, but prevailing in an unprecedented hand recount of the 2.9 million ballots cast.
Gregoire, the state attorney general, quickly convened a post election victory celebration with her family that winning candidates usually throw within hours of the polls closing.
"An election night without end has concluded," Gregoire, 57, told cheering supporters in Olympia, the state capital.
"And I am honored to stand before you as governor elect of the great state of Washington."
However, the angry Republican response was essentially: Certification, schmertification.
Gregoire's opponent, former State Sen Dino Rossi, vowed to continue to contest the outcome, and he and his supporters also stepped up calls for an extraordinary solution: a new vote entirely.
The confusing and downright wacky nature of the race was highlighted Thursday when the two candidates held dueling public events within a half an hour of each other.
Rossi went first, producing parents holding a photograph of their son stationed in Fallujah, who, they said, received a ballot so late that he threw it out, thinking it would not be counted.
Democrats disputed the assertion, but Rossi said it was evidence of an election so "muddied" and botched that a new vote needed to be held.
"I wouldn't want to take office with this cloud overhead.
I would want a re vote," said Rossi, 45, who last month had called on Gregoire to concede when what he called the "more accurate" machine recount had put him ahead by 42 votes.
Gregoire said the recount process had worked exactly as outlined in state law, with the "gold standard" of a hand recount having uncovered roughly 4000 votes that for various reasons had gone unread by the machines, as well as some absentee ballots that had been wrongly disqualified.
She dismissed the notion that a new election was necessary.
"A do over, to Mike and I, is only in golf," said Gregoire, referring to her husband.
"We call it a mulligan.
This is not golf."
Gregoire was declared the winner Thursday by Secretary of State Sam Reed, a Republican, putting him in the unusual position of having certified both Rossi and Gregoire as governor elect.
On Nov 24, Reed, following state election law, declared Rossi the winner, by 42 votes, or a stunningly small 0.0015 percent of the vote.
But the Democrats, also following election law, demanded the hand recount allowed for when a statewide margin is 150 votes or less.
It is that contentious process albeit one overseen by the members of both major parties who make up county election boards that produced a different set of results, with Gregoire winning by 129 votes.
Reed said he believed the election was fair and not "botched," but he did not declare it indisputably over.
"I would not say I think somebody ought to be conceding at this point," he said.
A new election would need authorization from the courts or the Legislature where Democrats control both houses.
The constitutionality of another vote would surely be contested in the courts.
The inauguration is set for Jan 12 and Republicans have hinted they might boycott it.
If Gregoire is inaugurated, the event would mark a political milestone: The first time any state would have a female governor and two female U.S. senators.
The GOP moved quickly on several fronts Thursday to undermine Gregoire's legitimacy, fighting for any leverage they can give Rossi in his bid to become the first Republican governor here in 20 years.
The powerful architect of several statewide anti tax initiatives, Tim Eyman, called on his supporters to "bury Olympia" with angry phone calls.
"Tell them all that you demand a revote on the governor's race," Eyman wrote in an e mail message.
"Tell them that they're kicking a hornet's nest by rejecting your vote and your decision for governor."
Other Republicans suggested Rossi supporters tie Ukrainian style orange ribbons around their car antennas.
Democrats said the protest was petulant.
Some election law experts said Gregoire's victory would be less than rock solid until the state Supreme Court gets involved in the certification issue.
The court's nine members are elected in non partisan races.
It did essentially rule in Gregoire's favor earlier this month when it ordered that roughly 500 previously uncounted absentee ballots in the Democratic stronghold of King County be counted.
Those ballots, sealed in the inner envelopes a voter signs when mailing in an absentee ballot, had been erroneously cast aside because of a computer error.
Republicans protested, accusing King County of conducting a partisan treasure hunt for votes, but Democrats noted that some more Republican friendly counties also turned up new ballots.
Neither Democrats nor Republicans objected to counting those votes.
While it's never happened in Washington state, a re vote took place in 1975 in New Hampshire.
A U.S. Senate race there came down to a two vote difference between the candidates, and in the ensuing legal fight, the two candidates eventually agreed to a new vote, held 10 months after the first.
The Democrat won.
Invoking the tumultuous legal and political battle over the 2000 presidential contest in Florida, Gregoire said the manual recount had amounted to an "absolutely professional" model for how a razor close election should be handled.
In Florida, a state court ordered recount of the votes was halted by the U.S. Supreme Court, leaving George W. Bush the winner.
"We worked together to ensure that votes were counted, problems were revealed, mistakes were fixed," Gregoire said.
"We proved that Washington state is not Florida, and now we move forward."
Democrat Christine Gregoire, winner of one of the closest governor's races in U.S. history, was inaugurated Wednesday amid a legal challenge that could undo her election.
Gregoire, 57, a scrappy three term attorney general who took on the tobacco industry and polluters, took the oath of office before a joint session of the Legislature.
Republicans had battled for weeks to delay her inauguration.
Backers of her Republican rival, Dino Rossi, continue to push for a whole new election to decide the race.
Although the state is dependably Democratic, Gregoire narrowly lost the first two vote counts.
But when Democrats ordered one final hand recount, she pulled ahead for the first time, winning by a minuscule 129 votes out of 2.9 million ballots cast.
Republicans say widespread irregularities, including votes cast by felons and dead people, spoiled the election to the point where it is impossible to truly know who won.
Invoking a rarely used law that allows an election "contest," Republicans have asked the courts to set aside the election and order a redo.
In a nondescript courtroom in this small farming town, America's electoral system is about to stand trial.
The battle over Washington's contested governor's election touches on many of the questions that divide this country between rural and urban, Republican and Democrat, red and blue and echoes frustrations of the past two presidential elections.
Republican Dino Rossi is challenging Democratic Governor Christine Gregoire's victory in the closest statewide election in national history, alleging widespread problems including illegal votes cast by felons and dead people.
The challenge goes to trial Monday, months after Gregoire was sworn in.
Rossi won the first count and a machine recount, but the Democratic stronghold of Seattle pushed Gregoire to a 129 vote win in a final, hand recount of 2.9 million ballots.
In rural Washington, the complaint is pretty simple: They're tired of Seattle choosing their political leaders.
"Seattle is the tail that wags the dog in the state," complained Republican King County Councilman Steve Hammond, whose working class, suburban district is a 20 minute drive from downtown Seattle.
"There is a disenfranchised feeling out there."
Add to those regional tensions the continuous parade of errors from the King County elections division officials acknowledged finding 94 uncounted ballots in boxes as recently as last month and you get a Republican brew of suspicion and resentment that resembles how Democrats felt after President George W. Bush won the 2000 and 2004 elections.
Gregoire, a three term state attorney general, was the anointed successor to popular two term Democrat Gary Locke.
But she struggled against Rossi a moderate Republican, former state senator and self made real estate millionaire who charmed voters with a savvy campaign.
Gregoire won only eight of Washington's 39 counties when all the votes were counted, recounted by machine, and recounted again by hand.
She was losing until Seattle counted its last votes the same thing that happened in 2000 when Senator Maria Cantwell defeated Republican Slade Gorton.
In the trial, Republicans are alleging widespread problems in the election, including illegal votes cast by felons and dead people, and provisional ballots that were illegally tallied without being properly checked.
Rossi wants a new election, although most Washington residents do not.
A March poll of 800 voters by a Republican consulting firm found that while 56 percent believed Rossi was the true winner, only 39 percent wanted a new election.
Rossi acknowledges that many people want to move on.
But he can't.
"I told my kids, sometimes the right thing to do isn't the easy thing to do.
The easy thing to do would be to turn a blind eye to it," said Rossi.
"It's really basic, and having a system you can have faith in is really the foundation of our democracy."
Gregoire, meanwhile, believes the trial will simply dredge up old bitterness.
"We're going to see more rhetoric, more accusations," Gregoire said.
"I'm a person that lives by the law, and the law in the state of Washington says I'm governor."
Whoever loses will appeal to the state Supreme Court, which will make the final decision.
Rossi hopes the Supreme Court will hear the case in June and nullify the election, creating a vacancy in the governor's office that will be temporarily filled by Lieutenant Gov. Brad Owen.
Then candidates will file in July, compete in a primary in September, and voters will chose a new governor in November.
That's an ambitious timetable, and perhaps an exhausting proposition for voters who just survived a messy election season.
The closest governor's race in Washington history was forced into a recount as counties finished tallying the ballots and found only a few votes separating the candidates out of 2.8 million cast.
Republican Dino Rossi held a mere 261 vote lead over Democratic Attorney General Christine Gregoire after all counties reported their final tallies to the state.
A recount is required by state law when there is less than a 2000 vote margin.
"After this election, I'm going to have 'Every vote counts' tattooed on my forehead," Gregoire spokesman Morton Brilliant said Wednesday.
Wednesday was the deadline for counting the ballots.
The recount means Washington voters will have to wait until next Wednesday to find out who their next governor is a stunning scenario considering the experts never thought it would be this close.
Gregoire was considered the favorite.
"We really aren't going to know before we do this recount who the governor is going to be," said Secretary of State Sam Reed, a Republican who will oversee the recount process.
"I feel sorry for Attorney General Gregoire and Senator Rossi."
Washington is one of two states (the other is Alaska) that allow voters to mail ballots on Election Day, so votes have trickled in at an agonizingly slow pace.
As political junkies across the country have recovered from their presidential election withdrawal, they have turned to the Washington governor's race for entertainment.
Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat who is stepping down after two terms, said he has "never seen anything like this before."
"It's fun, it's exciting, it's like a two week playoff series.
But it's a lot more important than a ballgame," said Joe Arko, a Texas doctor who has been following the Washington election religiously on the Internet.
The election is reminiscent of the 2000 U.S. Senate race in Washington that took several weeks of counting and recounting before Democrat Maria Cantwell was declared the winner over Republican incumbent Slade Gorton.
Washington is a Democrat leaning state that has not elected a Republican governor since 1980.
John Kerry won the state with 53 percent of the vote, Locke easily defeated Republican opponents in the past two elections, and Democrats control the Legislature.
So why is this election so close?
Gregoire was the Democrats' Wonder Woman.
Polished and popular, the 57 year old attorney general won national recognition as lead negotiator of the national tobacco settlement in the late 1990s.
But her campaign struggled to find a message that resonated with voters.
Rossi, meanwhile, surprised everyone with a slick, strong campaign that painted him as a compassionate conservative.
The 45 year old Rossi, a wealthy real estate agent, lacked name recognition outside his district, but his promise of a fresh start in state government caught on with voters.
"Gregoire ran a front runner, media based race, where she did not take controversial positions, and focused her resources on the media rather than the grass roots, and that's very dangerous," said political scientist Ken Hoover, a professor at Western Washington University.
"Rossi had a somewhat sharper message."
Washington elections are usually clean to the point of dullness.
But the twists and turns in the vote counting have sparked conspiracy theories and court battles.
"We have arrived at the moment which all reasonable Washingtonians have dreaded for four years: the moment when the Court is asked to micromanage an election," Judge Dean Lum wrote in a decision ordering that certain provisional ballots be counted.
On the Net: Election results: http://www.vote.wa.gov
NORTHWEST WASHINGTON: REPUBLICANS CRITICIZE RECOUNT The head of the state Republican Party, Chris Vance, sharply criticized ballot counting procedures in King County, where a manual recount completed last week nudged the Democratic candidate for governor, Christine O. Gregoire, ahead of the Republican, Dino Rossi, by 130 votes.
It was the third count in the close race, and the first time Gregoire had taken the lead.
"We have extreme concerns about the way King County conducted this election," Vance said, citing what the party claimed were illegally altered ballots and changing standards for evaluating voter intent.
Bobbie Egan, a spokeswoman for King County Elections, responded, "We have followed the letter of the law, and I think that's been proven many times."
Two weeks after the election, Washington state still doesn't have a new governor.
And voters are weathering the suspense the way Seattle residents shrug off the rain.
"People in this part of the world tend to be rather pleasant.
They expect people to be civil in the way they behave," said Ken Hoover, a political scientist at Western Washington University.
"New York, this isn't.
That's why people like to live here."
The vote counting is still going on.
As of Tuesday night, Republican real estate agent Dino Rossi led by just 19 votes out of 2.8 million cast.
Rossi had 1367365 votes to Democratic Attorney General Christine Gregoire's 1367346.
Across the state, about 6000 votes remained to be counted.
Of the four counties with the most votes outstanding, two favor Rossi and two Gregoire.
Democrats scored a victory on Tuesday when a judge rejected the state Republican Party's attempt to stop King County from counting hundreds of provisional ballots.
Party leaders sniped at one another, but even their bickering conveyed a sense of superiority to other, messier election dramas.
"We live in King County, not Broward County (Florida)," Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels said.
"Let's count every vote."
While protests broke out in Florida after the 2000 presidential election, no angry mobs have stormed the county canvassing centers in Washington not even slightly ticked off mobs.
People may be on the edge of their seats, but they are sitting quietly and politely.
"Washington voters have come to expect to wait for returns," said Bobbie Egan, King County elections spokeswoman.
"Counting absentee ballots just takes a long time."
Glacially slow vote counting goes with the territory in Washington politics.
In most states, mail in ballots must be received by Election Day.
Washington and Alaska, however, require only that ballots be postmarked by Election Day.
With an estimated 60 percent of Washingtonians voting by mail, close races can drag on for weeks as absentee ballots trickle in to county offices.
The 2000 U.S. Senate race took several weeks of counting and recounting before Democrat Maria Cantwell was declared the winner over Republican incumbent Slade Gorton.
Wednesday is the deadline to finish counting, so Washington should know who the next governor is by then.
Unless, of course, there are recounts.
Under state law, a recount must be held if the final margin of victory is less than 2000 votes.
Six statewide vote recounts have been conducted since 1968, though none of them changed the outcome.
Gregoire was heavily favored going into the race.
If Rossi continues trending upward, he could pull off a huge political upset and become Washington's first Republican governor in 20 years.
Some glitches have surfaced.
Elections officials in Grays Harbor County started recounting all 28000 ballots Tuesday after discovering a problem in the computer reporting system.
The pressure may be getting to some.
Democratic State Party chairman Paul Berendt wept openly after a judge ruled in favor of the party's effort to track down 929 people whose provisional ballots were in danger of being invalidated.
"We were just trying to get people their right to vote," he said.
"It meant a lot to me."
Outside the campaign headquarters, though, people are taking the drawn out election in stride.
"We're civilized enough out here.
We have faith in our democracy," said Jean Wright, 44, a construction inspector in Olympia, Washington's capitol city.
"To have every vote counted, that's most important to me."
Still, she said, "I am dying to find out."

New ballots continued to pop up here in King County as the second recount in the race for Washington governor descended into an alphabet soup of intrigue and, in a neighboring county, a judge issued a restraining order preventing King County from counting the newfound ballots.
The fight over the new ballots began this week when a King County councilman complained that his absentee vote had not been counted, leading to the discovery of 573 absentee ballots that election officials said had been rejected in error, including the councilman's.
On Friday morning, the number of newfound ballots grew by 150 as King County announced it had failed to include in its earlier count of 573 ballots those from voters whose last names began with A, B and C. They were found tucked away in a cage holding all of the county's ballots.
Because King County, which includes Seattle, is predominantly liberal, the Democrats hope those 723 ballots can push their candidate, Christine O. Gregoire, to victory.
The initial count after the Nov 2 election had the Republican candidate, Dino Rossi, ahead by 261 votes out of 2.9 million cast.
When the first recount, done by machine, ended last month, Rossi's lead had shrunk to 42 votes.
The second statewide recount, done by hand, had Rossi leading by 50 votes as of Friday.
King County, the state's most populous county, is the only one that has not completed the hand count.
On Friday afternoon Judge Stephanie Arend of Pierce County Superior Court ordered King County not to count the new ballots so the Republican Party could gather more information on their origins.
The Republicans had gone to court in Pierce County, just south of King County, because they wanted to ensure a fair hearing, said Chris Vance, the state party chairman.
State law allows plaintiffs suing one county to be heard in a neighboring county for that reason.
This week the state Supreme Court said it would not force counties to reconsider ballots they previously rejected if the counties chose not to do so.
King County elections officials had decided to review the rejected absentee ballots, but Arend stopped them on Friday.
The gubernatorial elections in Washington state and the US island of Puerto Rico have finally ended, seven weeks after the close results of their respective elections led to bitter political and legal fights, officials said Friday.
The more high profile race in Washington state evoked memories of the 2000 presidential election quagmire in Florida, as a recount gave Democrat Christine Gregoire a 130 vote lead over Republican contender Dino Rossi.
Rossi had led the election by just 261 votes after the November 2 vote when 2.9 million voters cast their ballots, leading to an automatic hand recount.
Rossi's lead shrank to 42 votes following the recount, but a new review was ordered after authorities realized that 735 ballots from a county around Seattle were never counted.
After the latest recount, Gregoire, the state's attorney general, led by 130 votes.
"The election is over," Gregoire said.
But Rossi has refused to concede, reserving his right to challenge the result in court.
State law allows a challenge until January 20.
Washington's secretary of state, the state's top election official, must certify the vote next week.
In the US commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Anibal Acevedo Vila of the ruling Popular Democratic Party defeated former governor Pedro Rossello by 3228 votes, or 48.4 percent to 48.2 percent.
The state's election commission will finish the recount Monday and certify Acevedo Vila as the winner Tuesday in one of the island's tightest elections.
A month and a day after voters went to the polls, the closest governor's race in Washington state history and one of the nation's closest ever statewide contests lurched forward Friday, as state Democrats announced they had raised enough money to start a third count, this one by hand, of nearly 3 million ballots.
The statewide hand recount is expected to take about two weeks and seems certain to trigger court challenges from both Democrats and Republicans.
The Democratic Party said Friday it would ask the state Supreme Court to rule that all ballots be counted under uniform rules from county to county.
"We are going to count every vote in every county," said Paul Berendt, chairman of the state Democratic Party.
After the second count, Republican Dino Rossi led Democratic Christine Gregoire by just 42 votes.
The phenomenally tight election appears to have motivated national Democratic Party leaders stung by criticism of Al Gore's concession in 2000 and Sen John Kerry's concession last month to make sure that the party not look weak kneed when there is a legal avenue for reversing an election's outcome.
The $730000 down payment that will start a statewide recount came from cash leftover in Kerry's presidential campaign, from the Democratic National Committee and, in the past two days, from 15000 smaller donations, many of them from individuals reached by Democracy for America, an organization created by Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and presidential primary candidate.
"I am grateful and humbled by the outpouring of support for a hand count of every vote," Gregoire said after learning her party had come up with the money.
"With the election too close to call, a hand count will finally determine the winner."
The first machine vote count showed Rossi, 57, a self made businessman and former state senator who ran a strong campaign in this Democrat leaning state, ahead by 261 votes over Gregoire, 45, whose three terms as attorney general had made her a well known name statewide and who had been widely expected to win the election.
The second machine count, which was mandatory under state law, whittled Rossi's winning margin down to just 0.0015 percent.
By comparison, George Bush's 539 vote victory over Al Gore in Florida in 2000 a margin of 0.0091 percent was robust.
When Secretary of State Sam Reed, a Republican, this week certified Rossi as governor elect a certification that by law allowed the hand count challenge announced here Friday he said the governor's election was uniquely tight: "We have checked with experts around the nation, and nowhere has there ever been an election of this magnitude that is this close."
Exactly which ballots will now be recounted by hand is in dispute.
This week the Democratic Party sent a letter to Reed asking that all ballots, including those disqualified in previous counts by county canvassing boards, be included in the recount.
Reed has said that only votes counted in the first recount should be counted again.
According to Gregoire, state law allowing for a hand recount to be supervised by observers from both parties was designed for just this kind of cliffhanger election.
Initially, Democrats wanted to only recount Democratic leaning King County near Seattle, but Gregoire said it should be statewide.
"My request of the state Democratic Party is simple: count the entire state or don't count at all," Gregoire said Thursday, when the state Democratic Party was about $100000 short of what it needed for a down payment on the statewide recount.
If the recount reverses the outcome of the election, which many Democratic Party leaders believe is likely, the state will pay for it and Democrats will get their money back.
The total cost of a recount is expected to be about $1.5 million.
Rossi's campaign and the state Republican party leaders have been saying for weeks that Gregoire should concede the election, for the good of the state and so Rossi can get on with the preparatory work for being governor.
But when reporters asked Rossi this week whether he would have demanded a hand recount if he were behind by just 42 votes he sidestepped the question.
Florida is settled this time around and the country knows who is president, but Washington state residents are still wondering: Who is the new governor?
"Neck and Neck," a phrase that was punctuated with an exclamation point Thursday on the Web site of the Republican candidate, one time underdog Dino Rossi, is almost an understatement at this point.
The latest vote tallies in a gubernatorial cliffhanger, whose outcome will be determined by hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots yet to be counted, show Rossi and his Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Christine Gregoire, within a hair of each other.
On Thursday evening, Gregoire had 49.45 percent of the vote and Rossi had 48.45 percent.
On Wednesday morning, Rossi, 45, a businessman who has a dog named "Dubya" and may be only the latest benefactor of the national Republican renaissance, was ahead by about 800 votes.
By Wednesday evening, though, Gregoire, 57, who was favored to win until the final days of the campaign, was ahead by about 14000 votes.
By Thursday night, Gregoire had widened her lead to 21234 votes.
But there were still 682645 votes left to count, and the possibility of a recount loomed in a state that has not sent a Republican to its governor's mansion in Olympia since 1980.
"I have a headache," said Paul Berendt, chairman of the Washington State Democratic Party.
"I never had a tension headache leading up to the election, but I've got one now."
Gary Locke, the current governor, who decided not to run for re election last year and threw his support behind Gregoire, said in a telephone interview, "Everybody is on pins and needles."
Still, Locke and Berendt said Thursday that they were optimistic, as were officials with the Gregoire campaign, the state's Republican Party chairman and Rossi campaign officials, all of them describing complicated formulas pointing to a win for each side.
The counting of absentee ballots is expected to continue at least through Friday evening.
"It's too close to call, but I'd rather be us than them," said Chris Vance, the state Republican Party chairman.
Vance added, "When you've got a really good Republican with a lot of money and a really good Democratic with a lot of money, that's what you get: dead even."
Fifty eight days after the election, Christine O. Gregoire was declared the governor elect of Washington on Thursday, the official winner by an infinitesimal margin after two recounts in a historically close race.
Far from conceding and bringing this long election to a close, though, her Republican opponent, Dino Rossi, who earlier led in the Nov 2 election by 261 votes out of 2.9 million cast and was ahead in the first recount by 42 votes, made it clear that he was not willing to recognize that Washington now has a governor elect.
He indicated that he was bound to contest the results but announced no specific plans.
Secretary of State Sam Reed, a Republican who certified the results of the final recount on Thursday, declaring Gregoire, a Democrat, the winner by 129 votes, indicated that he did not expect things to end here.
Asked if he thought Gregoire would be inaugurated as scheduled on Jan 12, Reed, said: "I don't have enough information to be able to make an educated guess.
I'm not sure what's going to be brought forward."
Reed said that while he believed in the accuracy of the election results and had no reason to suspect fraud or misconduct, he said he also believed that Rossi had the right to review the balloting for a possible legal challenge.
Rossi, 45, a former state senator and wealthy real estate broker, had sent Gregoire, 57, a letter on Wednesday evening asking her to join him in requesting that the Democratic controlled Legislature order a new vote for governor.
She refused, saying on Thursday that the most accurate count of the three conducted was the hand count the Democratic Party requested after an automatic machine recount gave Rossi an edge of only 42 votes.
She said she was moving forward as the state's governor elect.
Gregoire stopped short of asking Rossi to concede, saying: "I have been called on many times to concede.
It's up to Senator Rossi when and if he will."
Gregoire, the state attorney general, had a gubernatorial air about her at a televised news conference at the state legislative building in Olympia as she congratulated her opponent for a campaign well run, referred to statehouse reporters by their first names, tackled questions about the budget and raising taxes and alluded to being sworn in next month.
"I am prepared to take the oath of office," she said.
"Let us come together as one Washington state."
Republicans, or any voter who wants to contest the results of the final recount in court, have from now to 10 days after Gregoire is sworn in to contest the election legally.
Unless the Legislature decides to issue Gregoire her "certificate of election" on another date, Reed said, Republicans have until Jan 22 to contest the election.
After a bitter and protracted recount fight in the Washington governor's race, elections officials announced Wednesday that the Democratic candidate, Christine O. Gregoire, was leading her Republican opponent by 10 votes a minuscule margin but a stunning reversal of the Nov 2 election results.
The preliminary results elated Democratic Party officials and came only hours after the party scored another victory, when the state Supreme Court agreed with the Democrats' contention that more than 700 newly discovered and erroneously disqualified ballots in heavily Democratic King County should now be counted.
Since those ballots came from a county where Gregoire, 57, already had a solid lead, the ruling could well allow her to increase her extraordinarily tiny edge in a race that is the closest in state history.
The day's events dealt a serious blow to state Republicans and Dino Rossi, 45, a real estate executive and former state senator, who had been certified the winner of the Nov 2 vote after eking out a margin of 261 votes out of almost 3 million cast.
He later won a machine recount by only 42 votes.
Official results from the manual recount will not be announced until Thursday, after King County reviews the 723 disputed ballots.
Republicans, who fought hard to keep those ballots out of the tally, were already vowing Wednesday to press election officials to consider several hundred other disqualified ballots cast in other counties.
And whatever the final results, they are almost certain to be contested.
"This count, this election, is not over," said Chris Vance, the chairman of the state Republican Party.
The Supreme Court, he said, "basically threw the door open to start all over again.
I think that's crazy."
Vance said Republicans planned to "show up at 9 a.m." on Thursday "on the doorstep of every county auditor with people whose votes weren't counted for Dino Rossi."
At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Gregoire, looking upbeat for the first time since before the election, said she was not personally asking Rossi to concede.
"I leave the decision about conceding to Mr Rossi," she said.
"I have been called on many times to concede."
Gregoire steered clear of proclaiming victory.
"It is too early to declare victory," she said.
"Although we are ahead right now, there are still hundreds of votes left to be counted."
Alleging that dead people, felons and other ineligible voters cast ballots in Washington state's tortuously close election for governor, the Republican candidate filed a lawsuit Friday, seeking the extraordinary remedy of a new election.
Christine O. Gregoire, the Democratic attorney general, last week was declared the winner by just 129 votes of the nearly 2.9 million cast.
The candidate on the losing end of that certification, ex State Sen Dino Rossi, said he would petition a court for an unprecedented statewide revote, which he called the only way to fix the "certified mess" of the one conducted Nov 2.
"Most Washingtonians don't believe this has been a valid election," Rossi said at a news conference, where he was joined by former U.S. Sen Slade Gorton in the call for a new vote.
"They want a revote to make sure our state has a legitimate governor," Rossi said.
In the initial count of the results and a mandatory recount, both conducted with machine readers, Rossi was declared the winner, in the latter case by 42 votes.
That margin, 0.0015 percent, made the race one of the closest statewide contests in U.S. history.
But Gregoire, taking advantage of a state election law provision for a statewide hand recount of all the ballots, prevailed in the third round, as roughly 2000 ballots that were not read by the machines helped give her herrazor thin margin of victory.
The Republican secretary of state, Sam Reed, certified her election Dec 30, but it did not bring legal maneuvering to a close.
In recent days, some Republican poll watchers have emerged to say they saw so called "provisional" voters being allowed to cast their ballots directly into the election machines, rather than into special envelopes that should have gone to county election boards for certification that the voters were indeed eligible.
And The Seattle Times and the Seattle Post Intelligencer, in stories Friday, found at least 25 instances of people who had died before their absentee ballots were mailed, being listed as voting in the election.
Gregoire said Friday that the election and the recounts had been conducted in a "consummate professional way," and that she saw no evidence of the sort of massive fraud or malfeasance that would be necessary to undo her victory.
Regarding Rossi's lawsuit, which was filed in conservative friendly Chelan County, in a rural part of the state, Gregoire said: "I respect the rights of others to file an action in court.
That's their right.
I have to respect that, I'm the attorney general."
The bizarre race has taken so many twists and turns that nobody quite seems to know how it will wind up.
Some political experts here said it was striking how the two sides had reversed their roles when Rossi was ahead, Republicans called on Democrats to accept the results and "move on."
Gregoire and her supporters, planning for an inauguration ceremony in Olympia that Republicans may boycott, are essentially doing the same thing now to the Rossi camp.
Lance T. LeLoup, a political science professor at Washington State University, said that Gregoire seemed to hold the upper hand both legally and politically, and that the Republican idea of a revote could set a dangerous precedent.
"They're doing more to undermine public confidence in the election system than the election did itself," LeLoup said of the Republicans and their lawsuit.
"No matter what they say now, the fact is it is coming across as totally contrary to what the Republicans said about Bush in 2000 and what they said when Rossi was ahead in the count.
There's an element of sore loserism to it."
The thicket of issues raised in the lawsuit could take weeks to untangle, but on the other hand it might lead a judge in Chelan County to issue an injunction blocking the inauguration, which is what some Republicans seem to be hoping for.
If that happens, it is simply not clear how quickly the case could be moved along to the state Supreme Court.
Nor is it clear, if an injunction were in effect, just who would serve as the state's governor.
But for now, Gregoire remains scheduled to take the oath of office, and she insists she will do so.
The Seattle newspapers found some explanations for the dead voters, while others remained a mystery.
One man, who could now be subject to prosecution, confessed to the Post Intelligencer that he had followed his dying wife's wishes on how she would have wanted her ballot cast, even though she died Sept 29, well before the election.
She voted or rather he voted, twice for Rossi.
Liberia's exiled former leader Charles Taylor expressed concern Wednesday that his country may fall back into chaos if he is extradited from Nigeria to face war crimes charges, his spiritual adviser said.
Taylor met Wednesday with the renowned Indian evangelist Kilari Anand Paul in the eastern city of Calabar an AFP correspondent saw as pressure rose on Nigeria to extradite him to face war crimes charges.
Paul told journalists after meeting Taylor: "He said 'there will be tremendous destabilisation in Liberia if the extradition takes place'."
"There is no question in my mind that there will be chaos," added Paul.
The evangelist said he had spoken to "nine of Taylor's top 10 generals" and that he feared that Taylor could have sufficient support in Liberia so that his extradition and prosecution for warcrimes could provoke violent unrest.
Paul met Taylor in 2003 and was one of those who worked to persuade the Librian leader of the necessity for him to stand down and accept exile in Nigeria.
In a letter to the New York Times following Taylor's resignation, the warlord said the Indian preacher's intervention had been a decisive factor in his decision.
Under the terms of the asylum deal which brought Taylor to Nigeria in August 2003, the former president is forbidden from giving interviews to the media.
However, he exchanged greetings with an AFP reporter and other journalists who had been invited to his luxury Calabar villa by his guru Paul.
Since 2003, when an advancing rebel army forced him to flee Monrovia, Taylor has lived as a guest of Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo in the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar.
Obasanjo invited Taylor to Nigeria in order to bring an end to a 14 year civil war which pitched the guerrilla chief turned elected ruler against two powerful rebel groups.
Nigeria's move won widespread international support, but Obasanjo has since come under increasing international pressure to allow Taylor to be tried for alleged crimes against humanity.
Last week, Liberia's newly elected President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf confirmed that she had asked Obasanjo to send Taylor home.
Officials in Monrovia said he would be sent to Sierra Leone.
Many Liberians however themselves are fearful that Taylor's return might respark conflict in the fragile west African state.
The Bush administration is touting the rule of law and democracy as priorities in its effort to create stability and defeat terrorism.
Yet it remains curiously apathetic about the activities of one of the world's most notorious indicted war criminals, a man who is also an abettor of al Qaida and Hezbollah.
I am speaking of former Liberian President Charles Taylor, who has not only escaped answering for his crimes so far but who may be given an opportunity to repeat them if the United States does not act.
It seems to matter little here that Taylor's efforts to escape justice may well succeed because of U.S. inertia.
Indicted on 17 counts of crimes against humanity, Taylor poses a clear and present danger to West Africa and U.S. interests.
Yet the State Department continues to respond to congressional inquiries with bland assurances that everything is fine and Taylor is no longer a problem.
It's not true.
Unless Taylor is turned over quickly to the U.N. backed Special Court for Sierra Leone to stand trial, he will never face punishment for the crimes he committed in the region at the cost of tens of thousands of dead and hundreds of thousands of lives destroyed.
The mandate of the court, largely funded by the United States, expires at the end of the year.
It was established to try those "most responsible" for the atrocities in Sierra Leone.
Taylor is at the top of the list.
Taylor's were brutal, vicious crimes.
For more than a decade he presided over forces that murdered, raped and mutilated children, they also abducted children to use them as cannon fodder.
He created "Small Boys Units" made up of specially trained children who, while high on amphetamines, were used to raze villages and murder civilians.
He trained and supplied the Revolutionary United Front in neighboring Sierra Leone, whose signature atrocity was hacking off the arms, legs and ears of civilians, many of them children.
Taylor also hosted diamond buyers from al Qaida and Hezbollah for several years, allowing the two designated terrorist groups to earn and hide their wealth in an asset that is untraceable and easily convertible to cash.
In August 2003, under siege militarily, Taylor fled to Nigeria under an asylum deal backed by the Bush administration and Britain's Tony Blair.
The terms of the agreement with Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo were that Taylor not be allowed to participate in "active communications with anyone engaged in political, illegal or governmental activities in Liberia."
In return, Obasanjo would not be criticized for harboring an indicted war criminal.
Obasanjo promised to turn Taylor over only if the new Liberian government requested it.
There is clear evidence gathered by the court, U.N. officials in Liberia and European intelligence services that Taylor has made a mockery of the asylum agreement, meddling in Liberia's electoral process by phone, e mail, fax and cash payments.
The court has revealed evidence that Taylor funded and planned an unsuccessful January assassination attempt against Lansana Conte, the president of Guinea.
An investigation by the Coalition for International Justice has found that Taylor is spending some of the millions of dollars he looted to pay for campaigns of several of Liberia's presidential contenders.
His financial empire, built on shell companies and businesses stretching from Nigeria to Europe and the Caribbean, is feeding resources to his longtime business associates and military loyalists.
He will have the protection of whoever wins the October election.
The new government will then make sure Taylor can return home and never face the court.
Once he outlasts the court's mandate, he will have escaped prosecution and will continue to wreak havoc.
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan last month told the Security Council that Taylor's "former military commanders and business associates, as well as members of his political party, maintain regular contact with him and are planning to undermine the peace process" in Liberia.
David Crane, the court's chief prosecutor, said that "Taylor is still ruling the country from his house arrest."
Yet the Bush administration has offered no support for turning Taylor over to the court.
The State Department has, in several recent briefings, equivocated on whether U.S. policy really supports such a move.
Part of the reason may be Taylor's long association with U.S. intelligence services.
During much of the 1990s, Taylor was close to Moammar Gaddafi, the main financier of Taylor's wars.
Taylor regularly reported on his meetings to U.S. intelligence agencies and was paid for the information.
While the use of informants is necessary, protecting Taylor in the face of unspeakable atrocities just because of that historical relationship should not be tolerated.
Faced with the administration's apathy, a bipartisan group of legislators is taking the lead.
Reps. Ed Royce, R Calif., Sue W. Kelly, R N.Y., Frank R. Wolf, R Va., Victor F. Snyder, D Ark., and Tom Lantos, D Calif., are co sponsoring a concurrent resolution calling for Taylor's expeditious handover to the court.
The congressional action is helpful, but what is really needed is the administration's active support for Taylor's immediate extradition.
The administration must acknowledge that Nigeria acted in the best interests of the region by taking him and thank Obasanjo for his help.
Britain has already done this.
But Obasanjo must have the political cover of public U.S. support to hand Taylor over.
If Taylor escapes prosecution, West Africa will be endangered and U.S. moral leadership severely diminished.

The international pressure group Human Rights Watch on Saturday called on Nigeria to move quickly to make good its promise to surrender exiled former Liberian leader Charles Taylor to his home government.
Earlier Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo had said in a statement that Nigeria would honour a request from Liberia that the former president and war crimes suspect be handed over, but did not say when this would happen.
"We call for urgent steps to tighten security around his villa in Calabar and for him to be immediately taken into custody," said Elise Keppler, counsel to Human Rights Watch's international justice programme, in an email.
Taylor has been living in a luxury riverside villa in the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar since August 2003, when Obasanjo persuaded him to step down as president of Liberia and allow a 14 year civil war to come to an end.
When an AFP reporter visited the former warlord in his home on Tuesday there was no sign of any Nigerian security personnel on the approach road.
Taylor's black Jaguar saloon car has tinted windows and diplomatic plates and he appears to be able to drive in and out of his compound at will.
The Liberian leader greeted journalists, but was not allowed to talk to the press or make political statements.
He was equipped, however, with a battery of mobile telephones and held meetings with a stream of Liberian visitors.
"We welcome the Nigerian government's announcement that Taylor will be handed over to Liberia.
This is a tremendous moment for the people of Sierra Leone, Liberia, and all West Africa," Keppler said.
"Taylor can now face trial at the war crimes court in Sierra Leone where he is indicted on 17 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the armed conflict there," she added.
"The victims of the widespread murder and mayhem associated with Taylor will finally have the chance to see justice done," she said.
Liberia's former president Charles Taylor, accused of war crimes for his role in Sierra Leone's civil war, is a "menace to west Africa," Guinea's territorial administration minister said Wednesday.
"The investigators at the UN court have confirmed what Guinea has known and denounced for a long time," Kiridi Bangoura told AFP, stressing he was speaking for himself and not the government of President Lansana Conte, a longtime nemesis of Taylor's.
"The Liberian warlord is a real menace for peace in west Africa."
Taylor, who was offered asylum in Nigeria in August 2003 for stepping down and ending a seven year civil war in Liberia, has been accused by prosecutors at the UN backed war crimes court for Sierra Leone of complicity in a January assassination attempt on the ailing Conte.
"Our country has been forewarned and secured," added Bangoura.
"We want only that justice be done and that the troublemakers be prevented from doing more harm."
Conte is known to have backed rebels who rose in 1999 to oust Taylor two years after he became president at the end of his own seven year civil war, providing them with a rear base, training and military equipment according to human rights groups and regional diplomats.
Prosecutor David Crane has also alleged that Taylor is responsible for introducing the Al Qaeda terror network to west Africa through important transactions in so called blood diamonds mined during the complementary civil wars that raged in Sierra Leone and Liberia throughout the 1990s.
The prospect of the exiled former Liberian leader Charles Taylor being quickly sent to face trial appeared to recede Monday, as his country said it did not want him back and his host Nigeria said it had received no formal request to detain him.
Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo had on Saturday raised the hopes of international prosecutors that Taylor might soon be brought to court, when his government said Liberia was free to take the war crimes suspect "into custody".
But Liberia's President Ellen Sirleaf Johnson said: "Taylor should rather go to Sierra Leone rather than coming to Liberia.
Mr Taylor was not indicted by a Liberian court and therefore he is not needed by a Liberian court."
Following Nigeria's announcement, the chief prosecutor at Sierra Leone's UN backed Special Court called for extra security around Taylor's mansion in the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar, where he has lived since 2003.
"The watching world will wish to see Taylor held in Nigerian detention to avoid the possibility of him using his wealth and associates to slip away," prosecutor Desmond Da Silva said in a statement.
But Obasanjo's spokeswoman Remi Oyo told reporters: "We read of the request in the pages of newspapers, it hasn't arrived here."
Asked about the security measures surrounding Taylor, she said simply: "Taylor is not a prisoner here".
She refused to elaborate.
In August 2003, Obasanjo invited Taylor to step down as president of Liberia and accept exile in Nigeria in order to allow a 14 year old civil war to come to and end and enable a UN backed peace process to begin.
Since then, however, he has come under increasing pressure to send Taylor to Liberia's neighbour Sierra Leone, where he stands accused of sponsoring a bloody series of human rights abuses by a brutal rebel army.
Meanwhile, officials close to Taylor said he has remained in his luxury villa in the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar.
Taylor is accused of masterminding a policy of murder, torture, pillage and rape in the 1990s in Liberia and neighbouring Sierra Leone, where prosecutors have lodged a 17 count indictment alleging crimes against humanity.
In August 2003, in a bid to bring an end to a brutal civil war, Obasanjo invited him to step down as president, leave his besieged capital Monrovia and accept political asylum in Nigeria.
But the Nigerian leader has since come under pressure, notably from the United States, to send Taylor home.
Liberia would in turn be expected to hand over its former strongman to the special court in Sierra Leone.
Obasanjo is due to meet US President Beorge W. Bush on Wednesday in Washington.
White House spokesman Scott McLellan said that one of the items on the agenda will be "the need to bring Charles Taylor to justice."
Exiled former Liberian President Charles Taylor was not behind a failed January assassination attempt against Guinea President Lansana Conte, his spokesman said Tuesday, dismissing allegations by prosecutors for Sierra Leone's U.N. backed war crimes tribunal.
In Guinea, Yaya Camara, the top aid to the security minister, said his government had no proof that Taylor organized the Jan 19 attack and that the investigation was ongoing.
Allison Cooper, a spokeswoman for the special court, accused Taylor of plotting the assassination attempt, warning Monday it would "soon be repeated."
"Taylor didn't do any of those things alleged," his spokesman, Vaanii Paasawe, said from the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar, where the ex warlord turned president lives in exile.
Camara said from Guinea's capital, Conakry: "We don't know yet who tried to assassinate Guinea's president.
A lot has been said about this affair since the beginning, but it's important to say that the investigation is still going on."
Camara said his government had had no contact with the Freetown based court since the assassination attempt.
Taylor gave up the presidency and fled to Nigeria in August 2003, part of a peace deal brokered as rebels besieged the Liberian capital, Monrovia.
Taylor was later indicted by the war crimes tribunal for backing Sierra Leone rebels in a vicious 10 year insurgency in the diamond rich nation.
Cooper, the war crimes court spokeswoman, said Monday that Taylor "remains in contact with his political network in Liberia on a day to day basis," adding that he'll "remain a menace to West Africa until he is turned over for trial to the special court for Sierra Leone."
Nigeria has repeatedly rejected demands to surrender Taylor to the Freetown court to face war crimes charges, arguing it offered Taylor exile to end Liberia's war and bring peace to the region.
Nigeria has ordered Taylor to keep a low profile and not meddle in the affairs of Liberia or any other nation.
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo's spokeswoman, Remi Oyo, told The Associated Press her government had "no evidence that Taylor is breaching the terms of his stay in Nigeria."
Cooper said Taylor ordered the attempt on Conte's life to punish him for supporting rebels of the now defunct Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy.
Guinea was widely believed to have supported Liberian rebels during the war, and New York based Human Rights Watch accused Guinea of violating a U.N. arms embargo on Liberia to supply weapons to rebels there.
The government has denied the accusations.
Camara said Guinea "has nothing which says that it was he (Taylor) who fomented the attempted assassination.
What we know is that Mr Taylor went to Burkina Faso and that a Burkina Faso military plane went to Nigeria to take him to Burkina Faso.
But what he did after that, we don't know."
He gave no other details.
In March, U.S.
Rep Sue Kelly, a Republican from New York, alleged that Taylor had traveled to Burkina Faso to meet with Islamist groups and paid for the assassination attempt.
Conte has ruled Guinea since a 1984 military coup.
The ailing leader suffers from a severe stomach ulcer and diabetes, and many fear violence and a power struggle may follow his death.
"Guinea is a powder keg with its own political problems.
It can implode at any time and it won't be necessarily because Taylor is interfering," said Paasawe.
"Taylor is not in a position to do that."
Sierra Leone's insurgency launched by rebels seeking control of Sierra Leone's government and diamond fields ended by 2002, thanks largely to forceful military intervention by Britain and that of Guinea, which borders Sierra Leone.
Associated Press Writer Paul Fornier in Conakry, Guinea, contributed to this report.
Wanted on war crimes charges, Liberia's former President Charles Taylor is keeping out of sight as he nears a second year of exile in a jungle encircled African city.
His host country, Nigeria, is under increasing pressure to expel the one time warlord from his all expenses paid purgatory and hand him to a U.N. backed tribunal to be tried on accusations he meddled in another country's civil war Sierra Leone's.
The United States said Tuesday that "the time has come for this to happen."
Taylor's spokesman, Vaani Paasawe, denies allegations by the Sierra Leone based court that Taylor is plotting fresh turmoil in West Africa, where he has long been accused of playing a central role in the region's mayhem.
The U.N. backed tribunal has increased calls in recent weeks for Taylor to be immediately handed over for trial, accusing Taylor of violating his asylum agreement by meddling in the affairs of Liberia and its neighbors.
Prosecutors accuse him of ties to al Qaida.
The United States helped arrange Taylor's flight as rebels besieged his capital, Monrovia, in August 2003.
Then, the world applauded Nigeria for granting Taylor asylum, saying that was the only way to bring peace to Liberia.
Now, the United States is among those who say Taylor should be extradited.
"We believe that justice will not be complete until Charles Taylor appears before the court to answer the charges against him, and believe the time has come for this to happen," said Rudolph Stewart, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria.
He said that President Olusegun Obasanjo had not gone far enough by offering to hand Taylor over to Liberia, rather than the court in Sierra Leone, if the government that results from October elections requested it.
"We have asked them to expedite this timetable.
We do believe that Taylor will be transferred to the court," said Stewart in an e mail to The Associated Press.
The anti Taylor chorus has heightened its pitch in recent months as the U.N. backed court, based in the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown, said it has new evidence showing Taylor was behind a January attempt to assassinate Guinea President Lansana Conte himself accused of backing the rebels that fought against Taylor.
The war crimes court accuses Taylor of backing rebels notorious for hacking off hands and arms in the 1991 2002 Sierra Leone civil war, allegations Taylor denies.
After assassinating Conte, Taylor hoped to relocate to Guinea, where he is already forming a new rebel group, the court says.
Sierra Leone's government would be attacked next, and the war crimes court "disrupted," according to an internal document, which says all this is scheduled to take place by the time of Liberia's Oct 11 presidential elections.
Sierra Leone for the first time last week called for Taylor to be handed to the war crimes tribunal.
Until then, it had kept quiet so as not to be seen as trying to influence the court.
Taylor triggered Liberia's descent into violence when he launched an insurgency from neighboring Ivory Coast in 1989 hastening a cycle of violence across West Africa.
The peace deal under which Taylor left Liberia brought an end to 14 years of conflict, in which an estimated 250000 died.
The country's fragile peace is now monitored by 15000 U.N. troops.
Taylor vowed upon his departure to return to Liberia but Paasawe says a return to power is the last thing on the former ruler's mind and denied all the allegations.
"He has told me categorically, he does not want to be president," Paasawe said.
"He would like to return to Liberia, certainly as a former president.
He has finally realized that he has served his time."
Paasawe also said Taylor would break a long media blackout and hold a press conference Aug 11 two months to the day before elections in his homeland.
A spokesman for the Nigerian president, Femi Fani Kayode, said media interviews are not allowed under an unwritten asylum agreement with Taylor, and that Taylor has not informed Nigerian authorities of the planned statement.
"He is being monitored very closely and we certainly won't tolerate a situation where he operates outside the conditions.
If necessary, extra steps will be taken," said Fani Kayode.
Taylor himself was unavailable to speak to The Associated Press during a recent attempt to visit him in the verdant southeastern Nigeria town of Calabar.
The government has provided him with a cream colored villa overlooking a winding river and forest as far as the eye can see.
Armed Nigerian police guard his hillside road near the Cameroon border.
Some 200 family members and wards are in Calabar with him.
Paasawe was unwilling to say if Taylor accused of surreptitiously slipping from Nigeria to conspire against his many foes was even home.
Nigeria said Saturday that it would end the asylum of deposed Liberian dictator Charles G. Taylor and hand him over to the Liberian government for trial.
Taylor, a warlord turned president who presided over a country shattered by civil war, was indicted by the U.N. backed Special Court in Sierra Leone in 2003 for war crimes and crimes against humanity in neighboring Sierra Leone during that country's decade long insurgency.
But the court has been unable to arrest Taylor, who left Liberia as rebels narrowed in on him in 2003.
Instead, he went into exile in Nigeria, where authorities agreed in an internationally brokered deal to grant him safe haven in order to end 14 years of civil war in Liberia.
"God willing, I will be back," the flamboyant Taylor said he as bid farewell to his country.
Since agreeing to accept Taylor, the Nigerian government has rebuffed numerous attempts to put him on trial before the international court, saying it would violate the agreement.
But Liberia's newly elected president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, raised the issue earlier this month with President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, describing it as an important part of bringing stability to Liberia.
"Liberia's peace is fragile," Johnson Sirleaf said during a news conference this month in New York after announcing her extradition request to the U.N. Security Council.
"There are many loyalists in our country to Mr Taylor."
"We inherited a problem," she added.
"We are a small country, we have no powers that others have, we have no security forces to protect our people and the safety of our nation, so we are caught in a situation that we have to take a major decision that should have been taken long before."
Even so, she said that she wanted to ensure that in any proceedings, there is an environment that protects the human rights of all, including those of the accused.
In a statement released by Obasanjo's office on Saturday, the president said Liberia was free to take Taylor into custody.
Although he is not under indictment in Liberia, U.N. peacekeepers there have been authorized by the Security Council to transfer him to Sierra Leone.
No precise date for the transfer was indicated, but Obasanjo said he had never been against surrendering Taylor to a democratically elected government in Liberia.
Johnson Sirleaf was sworn in as Liberia's president in January, becoming Africa's first woman to be elected head of state.
In his statement, Obasanjo, the past president of the African Union, said that before he agreed to hand over Taylor he consulted the current leader of the continent wide body, President Denis Sassou Nguesso of Congo Republic, as well as the head of ECOWAS, a regional trade group.
Taylor was forbidden from leaving Nigeria during his exile, but he continued to meddle in his former country's affairs from his government guest house in Calabar, on Nigeria's southern coast, using some of the millions of dollars he is accused of stealing from Liberia's coffers.
The court, set up in 2000, had issued an arrest warrant for Taylor on 17 counts in 2003 but Nigeria ignored it.
Obasanjo had said that he might consider a similar request by Liberia's government, but until this year the country only had transitional leaders.
With the backing of Libya and other regional powers, Taylor unleashed a cycle of war that gripped Liberia and much of West Africa during the 1990s.
In Sierra Leone, he is accused of training and arming Sierra Leone's rebels, many of whom were children.
That bloody conflict left tens of thousands of people dead and thousands more maimed by soldiers who hacked off civilians' limbs.
The war in Liberia was similarly vicious, with Taylor's rebel forces known for their ferocity.
Al Qaeda's network is actively seeking to destabilize West Africa, partly through its links with ex Liberian president Charles Taylor, who has given sanctuary to its operatives, a UN backed court said Tuesday.
Taylor faces a 17 count indictment by the Special Tribunal for Sierra Leone.
He is accused of arming and training rebels in exchange for so called blood diamonds.
"Al Qaeda has been in West Africa.
It continues to be in West Africa and Charles Taylor has been harboring members of Al Qaeda," said David Crane, a prosecutor with the warcrimes tribunal.
Within a month of arriving in Sierra Leone in May 2002 "we ran smack dab in the middle of Al Qaeda," said Crane.
Taylor has been harboring Al Qaeda members, including those who participated in the 1998 US embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya, since the attack.
"We also have activities as late as 6 April 2005," he said.
Crane specifically linked Taylor and Al Qaeda to an attempt to overthrow the government of Guinea, whose president, Lansana Conte, was the victim of a January 19 assassination attempt.
Chief investigator Al White emphasized that the researchers have been "receiving credible, reliable information" on the destabilization plans "from sources and witnesses we've been dealing with for three years in the region."
The sources report that Taylor "is actively involved in trying to destabilize the region and there will be another threat and another attempt very, very soon," White said.
Until Taylor is brought to justice "he will be an immediate, clear and present danger to peace and security not only in Liberia but in the entire West African region," White added.
Taylor, the former president of Liberia, is charged with warcrimes and crimes against humanity by the Special Tribunal for Sierra Leone for his role in that neighboring country's 1991 2001 civil war.
Though he has been gone from Liberia for over two years, Charles Taylor's presence still hangs over the west African country ravaged by his greedy and murderous rule, amid mounting global calls for his extradition to face trial on war crimes.
Presidential candidates lining up for the October 11 elections have moved either to distance or align themselves with the warlord turned president, depending on their constituencies, while former allies including his ex wife Jewel Howard Taylor are making their own bids for legislative seats.
Front runner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has had to publicly apologize for a 1990s era comment that supported his siege of Monrovia in the quest to overturn Samuel Doe, and her loyalties have been regularly called into question by opponents who say she funded his rebellion, a charge she has vehemently denied.
Roland Massaquoi, the standard bearer for Taylor's National Patriotic Party, says if he wants to get in touch with Taylor in his luxurious exile in southern Nigeria he can at any time, but, he stressed, "he listens to us, I don't have to listen to him".
Within Liberia, however, there is less support than abroad for Taylor's extradition to next door Sierra Leone to face a 17 count indictment for having armed and trained the rebel Revolutionary United Front in its decade of civil conflict considered among the most brutal wars in modern history.
Only Charles Brumskine, a businessman who served briefly as senator under Taylor, has made Taylor's handover to the UN backed court a campaign promise.
Others, including Johnson Sirleaf and Massaquoi, have suggested a need for further evidence to be presented by the court and say the priority should be recuperating the billions of dollars allegedly siphoned off by the former president.
The tepid response to the Taylor issue at home has not mitigated bellicose action from within the international community with respect to the indictment at the Freetown court and his extradition from Nigeria, should evidence be presented to suggest that he has been meddling in Liberia's internal affairs.
Liberia's transitional government, along with its neighbors in the Mano River Union, Sierra Leone and Guinea, in July suggested that "there may now be a need for a review of the terms of the temporary stay granted Taylor (in Nigeria)" The United States last week circulated a draft resolution at the United Nations to boost the mandate of the 15000 strong UN mission to allow for peacekeepers to arrest Taylor should he return to Liberia and bring him to trial.
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was in Monrovia on Friday for a day long visit, his first since accompanying Taylor into exile in August 2003 to end the civil war, has resisted all calls for his handover to Freetown, saying he will only offer up his unwelcome guest to an elected Liberian government.
"If Taylor is to be turned over to a court it is vitally important to demonstrate that he has broken the terms of his agreement," Brussels based thinktank Crisis Group wrote in its September 7 report.
"Shortly after inauguration, the new Liberian president should call for a meeting of (west African) heads of state to take a collective decision as to whether Taylor has breached the terms of his stay in Nigeria,to justify terminating his asylum."
The former president of Liberia, Charles G. Taylor, vanished Monday night, two days after the Nigerian government said it would end his asylum and allow him to face indictment by an international court here.
Taylor, the warlord turned president who unleashed a series of civil wars that engulfed much of West Africa in the 1990s, killing more than 300000 people, disappeared from the seaside villa where he had been living in exile, according to a statement released Tuesday by Nigeria's government.
His sudden disappearance was a huge setback for the court, which is trying those suspected of atrocities in Sierra Leone's decade long civil war, and a major embarrassment for the Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, just as he left for the United States to meet with President Bush.
It was unclear late Tuesday whether Taylor fled to escape prosecution or was abducted.
"Taylor's disappearance is a disgrace," said Corinne Dufka, head of the West Africa office of Human Rights Watch.
"Not only for the victims for the brutal war in Sierra Leone, but also for efforts to establish the rule of law in West Africa."
Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, said Tuesday that Taylor's disappearance would not relieve Nigeria of its responsibility to turn him over to the special court in Sierra Leone.
K. A. Paul, an evangelical Christian leader who has acted as a spiritual adviser and spokesman for Taylor, said Tuesday that he had spoken to one of Taylor's aides and had been assured that Taylor was in hiding somewhere in West Africa.
Backed by Libya and other regional powers, Taylor incited a civil war in Liberia in 1989, which quickly spread to neighboring Sierra Leone.
He is accused of trading guns and diamonds with the rebels seeking to topple Sierra Leone's government, backing a rebel force made up partly of child soldiers abducted from their homes and plying them with drugs to make them ruthless killers.
These child soldiers, and the rebel practice of chopping off arms and legs of civilians, made Sierra Leone's war one of the most brutal African conflicts in a generation.
A close ally of former Liberian leader Charles Taylor Tuesday charged Tuesday that President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf knows the whereabouts of the war crimes suspect who went missing from his exile home in Nigeria.
"Ellen knows where Taylor is especially after,Nigeria has said that her government could come and take the former president," said Sando Johnson, one of several Taylor associates recently arrested and freed in Monrovia on charges of planning to stir up violence.
"Ellen has created a problem for Liberia.
Ellen has declared war on Liberia by unilaterally asking Nigeria to turn over former President Taylor," he told AFP in an interview.
Taylor's disappearance came just 48 hours after Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo had announced that Liberia was free to "take Taylor into custody" and human rights activists were quick to condemn what they said may be a bid to escape international justice.
A former senator during Taylor's reign and an active member of the former ruling National Patriotic Party (NPP), Sando said "as a result of this, Liberia is not safe."
Asked if he had an idea of where Taylor could be Johnson said "I do not know where he is."
Presidential press secretary Charles Nelson said the government does not have "any final position on this matter".
Sirleaf is expected to address the tiny west African nation Wednesday morning.
Taylor's estranged wife Jewel Howard Taylor told Liberia's Star radio, sponsored by a Swiss non governmental organisation, that her former husband could be still in Nigeria.
"I do not know what the situation is.
But I do not think he will run away.
Charles Taylor is not a person who runs away.
So I do not think it is possible," said the former first lady of Liberia.
Howard Taylor, has warned that trying Taylor for war crimes would open a pandora's box.
"It is not just one person that is responsible for the war," she said.
"If we are talking about freedom and justice and if they want to punish people then every one has to be punished from the beginning to the end.
"And if we want to pardon every one then we should pardon every one across the board," she said adding that the recently established truth and reconciliation commission should be allowed to conduct its probe "and find out what the real story is and then we can move forward."
Meanwhile, Liberia former caretaker president Moses Blah threw his weight behind Taylor's demands to be tried outside Sierra Leone, where the former warlord is accused of sponsoring rebels in a brutal war against President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government in the 1990s.
Blah who ran the country for just two months after Taylor went into exile in 2003, said Sierra Leone was not a "neutral" ground to try the former head of state.
"Sierra Leone is accusing Taylor.
You can not turn yourself in to the accuser.
He is supposed to be tried on neutral ground.
"Taylor could go anywhere in the world to be tried other than Freetown," said Blah.
Taylor's escape was condemned by the chief prosecutor of the UN backed war crimes tribunal in Sierra Leone, who has accused the warlord of overseeing the massacre, torture, rape and enslavement of thousands of civilians.
The United Nations peacekeeping force in Liberia (UNMIL) is ready to arrest and transfer to Freetown war crimes suspect Charles Taylor, who left Nigeria Wednesday, a UNMIL spokesman said.
"We have a mandate under the (UN) Security Council resolution 1638 to apprehend, detain and transfer him to the Special Court in Sierra Leone," said spokesman Paul Egunsola.
"If he should come to Liberia UNMIL is ready to implement the mandate that has been given to it by the Security Council," Egunsola told a news conference moments before Taylor was airlifted from a northeastern Nigerian town of Maiduguri.
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, according to Information Minister Frank Nweke, "ordered the immediate repatriation of Charles Taylor to Liberia" shortly after he was caught trying to cross the border from his asylum home into neighbouring Cameroon.
After his capture, the fugitive warlord was detained under armed guard Wednesday in a military camp before being put on a presidential jet bound for Liberia.
The 15 member UN Security Council in November unanimously adopted a resolution permitting the 17000 strong UN force in Liberia to arrest Taylor in the event that he returns home.
UNMIL should apprehend, detain and transfer Taylor to Freetown to face prosecution before the special war crimes court, the Security Council mandated.
Taylor faces a 17 count indictment for having armed and trained Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United Front, sustaining a decade long civil conflict, one of the most brutal in modern history.
He left Liberia for Nigeria in August 2003 after stepping down as president, part of a peace deal ending the second of two civil wars that had ravaged Liberia since 1989.
Asked what measures UNMIL has taken to ensure Liberia's stability amid reports of discontent among the former warlord's allies over Taylor imminent return, Egunsola said the force was well equipped and ready to handle any problem that might arise.
"Let me assure you that UNMIL is ready and is prepared to deal with any situation," he said, adding that the force would "react robustly."
Security authorities in Monrovia have in recent days picked up several of Taylor's associates for questioning over alleged plots to create mayhem if Taylor were brought back from Nigeria.
UN chief Kofi Annan on Tuesday appealed to West African countries to arrest and deny refuge to Liberia's former leader and war crimes suspect Charles Taylor, who has disappeared from Nigeria.
Taylor is accused by a UN backed war crimes court in Sierra Leone of masterminding a policy of murder, torture, pillage and rape in Liberia and Sierra Leone, where prosecutors have lodged a 17 count indictment alleging crimes against humanity.
Annan's office late Tuesday issued a statement saying the UN chief "calls on all countries in the region not to give refuge to Mr Taylor, but to execute the warrant for his arrest."
The statement also urged those countries to comply with Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's request that Taylor be transferred to the Special Court in Sierra Leone.
Earlier Tuesday Annan told reporters that, if confirmed, Taylor's disappearance would be "extremely worrying."
Taylor had been living in exile in southeastern Nigeria until Monday night, when he was found to have left his luxury villa, only two days after Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said the government of Liberia "could take him into custody".
"I have heard the news.
We are trying to get more facts about it," Annan told reporters.
"It would be extremely worrying if indeed he had disappeared."
The UN secretary general said he was trying to talk to Nigerian authorities about the case.
In August 2003, in a bid to bring an end to a brutal civil war, Obasanjo invited Taylor to step down as president, leave his besieged capital, Monrovia, and accept political asylum in Nigeria.
International prosecutors and human rights advocates had warned that if Taylor was able to escape extradition to a the war crimes court in Sierra Leone, he might once again endanger the stability of West Africa.
A day after his evident escape, Nigerian police arrested former Liberian warlord and president Charles G. Taylor on Wednesday as he tried to cross into Cameroon, according to Nigerian police officials.
Nigeria's government plans to send him directly to Liberia, where government officials have said they plan to send him immediately here, to face a 17 count indictment on war crimes for his role in the bloody, decade long civil war in Sierra Leone.
"Mr Charles Taylor, the former president of Liberia, was arrested this morning at the Nigeria Cameroon border," said Haz Iwendi, a spokesman for the National Police, in a telephone interview.
"He was arrested in company of a driver and a woman and they have been taken into custody."
Alert border guards spotted Taylor, who was in a Land Rover with diplomatic plates, early Wednesday morning in the border town of Gamboru Ngala, Iwendi said.
Tayor would be sent to Abuja later Wednesday and then transferred to Liberia, Iwendi said, though he could not say how soon Taylor would arrive in Monrovia.
President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was in Washington on Wednesday meeting President Bush, said he felt "vindicated" after Taylor was arrested.
He said that his meeting with President Bush affords them the opportunity to discuss Taylor, and he promised the case would be "relentlessly and vigorously pursued to its logical conclusion."
The arrest was a dramatic turn in the already complicated saga of the effort to bring Taylor, who ignited a series of civil wars that killed 300000 people and engulfed much of West Africa during the 1990s, to justice.
Taylor fled Liberia in 2003 as a rebel insurgency tried to remove him from power, taking refuge in Nigeria after Obasanjo brokered a peace agreement.
Taylor was already under indictment for his role in Sierra Leone's civil war, but the Nigerian government said it would turn Taylor over for prosecution only if requested by an elected Liberian government.
Liberia's new president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, said in an interview with The New York Times before her inauguration in January that Taylor's fate was a relatively low priority, given the myriad problems facing Liberia and the fragility of the peace there.
But under intense political pressure on a visit to the United States earlier this month, including a threat by Congress to withhold aid to Liberia if she did not act, she asked Nigeria to hand Taylor over.
Kayode Fayemi, a Nigerian political analyst who has worked with Johnson Sirleaf to secure peace in Liberia, said the United States might have made matters worse for Liberia by pushing the country to deal with Taylor before it was ready.
"She was actually literally harassed to do what she did," Fayemi said.
"This is now going to make the situation much more complicated and so much worse."
Former Liberian president and war crimes suspect Charles Taylor, captured in Nigeria, left Liberia for Sierra Leone aboard a United Nations helicopter on Wednesday afternoon, AFP correspondents at Monrovia airport said.
The United Nations announced earlier on Wednesday that it was ready to arrest Taylor on his arrival in Liberia and transfer him to the Special Court in neighbouring Sierra Leone, which has indicted him for crimes against humanity committed during the 1991 2001 civil war there.
The helicopter left Monrovia airport at around 5:20 pm (1720 GMT), less than an hour after Taylor had arrived there aboard a Nigerian presidential plane, in handcuffs and surrounded by scores of government and UN security officials.
According to several representatives of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, who had arrived in Monrovia on Wednesday, the UN helicopter was due to take Taylor to Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, 350 kilomstres away.
"The helicopter is ,to take Taylor to Feetown," one of them told AFP on condition of anonymity.
Taylor had been flown to Liberia to Monrovia from Nigeria's northeastern town of Maiduguri, after he was captured early on Wednesday trying to flee the country following the Nigerian government's decision to extradite him.
The west African regional bloc ECOWAS praised Nigeria's arrest of fugitive warlord Charles Taylor on Wednesday and thanked its most powerful member for its role in hosting him in exile.
A statement from the Economic Community of West African States said members had received "with relief" the news that Taylor had been detained while trying to flee Nigeria, his home for 30 months, for Cameroon.
"ECOWAS wishes to use this opportunity to renew its appreciation to the government and people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for accepting Charles Taylor during a difficult period in the Liberian peace process," it said.
"The action helped end the carnage in the country, thereby creating a conducive environment for the successful conduct of elections and restoration of democratic governance, which had eluded Liberia over the years," it said.
Nigeria took in Taylor in August 2003 after African leaders persuaded him to stand down as president of Liberia in order to bring an end to a 14 year old civil war which had killed hundreds of thousands of people.
But Obasanjo had since come under pressure from the international community to surrender Taylor to face charges of crimes against humanity at a UN backed tribunal in Liberia's equally war torn neighbour Sierra Leone.
On Saturday, Obasanjo relented and said he would send Taylor home, allowing Liberia to extradite him to Sierra Leone if it so wished.
The former warlord promptly absconded but was picked up Wednesday trying to flee the country.
Nigeria has now deported him to Monrovia, where he is expected to be arrested by UN peacekeepers and transferred to Sierra Leone.
Liberia's one time warlord Charles Taylor was in the hands of Sierra Leone's tribunal Thursday, where he is set to become the first ever African head of state tried on war crimes charges by an international court.
Taylor has been indicted by the U.N. backed tribunal on 11 counts of crimes against humanity stemming from his support for brutal rebels in Sierra Leone.
His arrival in handcuffs at the court Wednesday represented a watershed moment for West Africa, a region long shaken by Taylor's warmaking.
"Today is a momentous occasion, an important day for international justice, the international community, and above all the people of Sierra Leone," said Desmond de Silva, chief prosecutor of the tribunal called the Special Court.
"His presence in the custody of the Special Court sends out the clear message that no matter how rich, powerful or feared people may be, the law is above them," de Silva said.
Nigerian police captured the exiled ex Liberian president late Tuesday as he tried to leave Nigeria, where he has lived in the south since stepping down from power during a 2003 rebel attack.
He was caught trying to slip across the northern Nigerian border with Cameroon with his son, an aide de camp and a local guide, along with two 50 kilogram (110 pound) sacks filled with U.S. dollars and euros, Nigerian police official Alhaji Mohammed Aminu Bello said.
U.N. peacekeepers ferried Taylor by helicopter to the court, where de Silva said he was read his arrest warrant and would make his first court appearance by the end of this week.
Taylor joined nine other defendants, also charged with crimes committed during Sierra Leone's brutal 1989 2002 civil war.
Taylor, a bombastic speechmaker during his time in the bush and as Liberia's president, made no comment.
The charges against Taylor stem from his support of the Revolutionary United Front rebels that terrorized civilians in Sierra Leone for years, chopping off the arms, legs, ears and lips of their victims.
On March 3, 2003, Taylor was indicted on 17 counts alleging war crimes, crimes against humanity and other serious violations of international humanitarian law for backing the rebels during the war.
De Silva said that on March 16, 2006, the judge of the Special Court approved an amended indictment of 11 counts, which he said "will ensure a more focused trial."
The court began trials in 2004, but Taylor was their highest profile defendant and the first African head of state to face trial on war crimes charges.
Nigerian police said they found him in a vehicle with diplomatic plates.
He was wearing a safari suit and was in possession of sacksful of dollars and euros, they said.
His journey to the U.N. court then went through several African countries, after Nigeria deported him to his native Liberia, which handed him over for extradition to Sierra Leone.
Nigeria had granted asylum to the fast talking, U.S. educated economist under a 2003 agreement that helped end Liberia's 14 year civil war.
But on Tuesday, Nigeria announced that Taylor had disappeared from his home in exile and admitted that his whereabouts were unknown, just a day before Nigerian President Oluesgun Obasanjo visited the United States to meet with President George W. Bush.
Bush congratulated Obasanjo on the capture Wednesday, saying that "the fact that Charles Taylor will be brought to justice in a court of law will help Liberia and is a signal, Mr President, of your deep desire for there to be peace in your neighborhood."
Nigeria had resisted calls from the United States, human rights organizations and the war tribunal in Sierra Leone to arrest Taylor to ensure he would stand trial.
Taylor in 1985 had escaped from a U.S. jail in Boston.
Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has said Liberia wanted Taylor tried in the Sierra Leone tribunal, rather than in Liberia, where it was feared his presence could destabilize the country's as it attempts to rebuild after installing the new leader in January.
Some 15000 U.N. peacekeepers are in Liberia, and the last U.N. soldier of what was once a 17500 strong force in Sierra Leone left in December.
Another 10000 strong U.N. and French peace force remains in Ivory Coast, where many former child soldiers that fought for Taylor are now believed embroiled in that conflict.
While the Sierra Leone tribunal's charges refer only to the war there, Taylor also has been accused of backing rebel fighters elsewhere in West Africa and of harboring al Qaida suicide bombers who attacked the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, killing more than 200 people.
"I think his capture and being put on trial does not only close a chapter but it also sends a powerful message to the region that impunity will not be allowed to stand and would be warlords will pay a price," said U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said at U.N. headquarters in New York.
Associated Press writers Bashir Adigun and Michelle Faul in Abuja, Nigeria, and Jonathan Paye Layleh in Monrovia, Liberia, and Edith Lederer at U.N. headquarters in New York contributed to this report.
Liberia's former president Charles Taylor, accused of fomenting bloody wars across West Africa, at last faces judgment for some of the mayhem wrought during his years in power.
Taylor, taken from exile in Nigeria and presented handcuffed on Wednesday to the U.N. backed tribunal in Sierra Leone, is charged with 17 counts of crimes against humanity stemming from a brutal rebellion that left many thousands dead or maimed.
His capture and imprisonment seem to bring his bloodstained 16 year odyssey to a close and avert a feared renewal of conflict in Liberia, had he returned there.
Instead, he becomes the first African head of state to face an international war crimes tribunal another step in growing efforts to make leaders accountable for their actions.
Taylor's 1989 insurgency in Liberia which eventually killed 200000 helped tilt the region into crisis.
His rise and fall reflect the painful struggles of West Africa, now working toward peace.
"Taylor for me is a ruthless dictator whose capture and subsequent trial should be welcome for all Liberian people.
The mayhem and destruction he brought has to be accounted for.
No more delay," said Romeo Snehtie, a 39 year old student in Liberia.
"We will remember him as a leader who was strong but who did not use his might for the improvement for the Liberian people."
Liberia, once among the richer countries in West Africa, is now among its poorest.
The shattered capital, Monrovia, has not had government supplied electricity, water or sewerage for over a decade.
Long years of crisis that ended with Taylor's flight to Nigerian exile in 2003 has left the country all but a failed state, with 15000 U.N. peacekeepers providing security for the new administration of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, whose inauguration this year ended a postwar transitional administration.
Taylor's 1989 incursion from Ivory Coast had spread chaos across Liberia and into Sierra Leone, whose brutal rebels fought a 1991 2002 civil war.
Taylor helped pioneer the use of child soldiers, often kidnapped from their parents and drugged.
His fighters still are believed to roam Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ivory Coast.
"Beyond the vast damage he has personally inflicted on West Africa, Charles Taylor embodies the misrule and warlord politics that have devastated the region," said Eric Witte, formerly a political adviser at the Sierra Leone court and now a senior associate at the Democratization Policy Council in Luxembourg.
"His arrest is a watershed for West Africa, as it not only prevents Taylor from future troublemaking, but may signal a new international approach to the region one built on the principle of accountability."
Taylor was born into a family of so called Americo Liberians, descendants of the freed American slaves that founded Africa's first republic in 1847 and ruled as elites for over a century.
Taylor lived in the Boston area of the northeast United States during the 1970s, earning an economics degree from Bentley College in Waltham, Massachusetts.
He later joined the government of President Samuel Doe, an illiterate mid level officer who took over the government in 1980, ordering the execution of 13 ministers who were tied to poles on a beach and machine gunned.
Sirleaf, then a minister herself, barely escaped and fled overseas.
Taylor fled after he was accused in 1983 of embezzling nearly a million dollars.
He went to the United States, where he was detained on a Liberian arrest warrant.
But he escaped from a Massachusetts jail in 1985 cutting through bars with a hacksaw and climbing down a knotted sheet to launch the civil war that ousted Doe.
Taylor won elections in 1997, beating Sirleaf by a wide margin.
But many ex allies took up arms against him in 2000 and attacked Monrovia in 2003.
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo helped broker peace in Liberia by offering Taylor exile in Nigeria, which he accepted and stepped down.
Obasanjo said he would hand Taylor to Liberia if a democratically elected leader requested it.
After Sirleaf gave the nod, he made good on his word Wednesday.
"I think his capture and being put on trial does not only close a chapter but it also sends a powerful message to the region that impunity will not be allowed to stand and would be warlords will pay a price," said U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said at U.N. headquarters in New York.
Associated Press writers Jonathan Paye Layleh in Monrovia, Liberia and Edith Lederer at U.N. headquarters in New York contributed to this report.
Liberia's warlord turned president Charles Taylor is due make his first court appearance in Sierra Leone Monday, the UN backed Special Court announced Friday.
"The initial appearance of Charles Taylor before the Special Court for Sierra Leone will take place on Monday, 3 April at 3:00 pm (1500 gmt)," said the court in a statement received by AFP in Dakar.
French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy announced Tuesday that the French government authorized power to local government officials to impose curfews in some areas to try to restore order and stop unrest raging for 12 days.
The French cabinet approved a decree so that local government officials, or prefects, could impose curfews where they consider the measures necessary, and the measures are expected to go into force on Wednesday, Sarkozy said.
The decree came after the worst violence from Sunday to Monday when 1408 cars were torched in nearly 300 towns.
The tensions a little decreased overnight Monday with 1173 vehicles burned in 226 towns, and 330 people arrested, compared with 395 on the previous night, according to National Police Chief Michel Gaudin.
More than 10 countries have warned their citizens of vigilance in their trips to France, although France's tourism minister, Leon Bertrand,insisted the country remained safe for tourists.
The violence began in Clichy sous bois, northeast of Paris, on Oct 27 when two teenagers were accidentally electrocuted as the hid in an electrical sub station to avoid a police identity check.
Dozens of youths went on a rampage, burning vehicles and vandalising buildings in a tough Paris suburb Friday in an act of rage following the death by electrocution of two teenagers trying to flee police.
Twenty three cars were gutted by fire and the windows of a shopping centre were smashed in the riot in Clichy sous Bois, which finally ended before dawn.
No arrests were made and there were no reports of injuries.
According to police, the violence erupted after two boys, aged 14 and 16, died when they scaled a wall of an electrical relay station and fell against a transformer.
The two had been trying to escape from police responding to the attempted robbery of a nearby worksite, officers said.
A third boy who had also jumped the wall was seriously hurt.
Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy said the three had not been "physically pursued" by the police.
He added that measures should be taken to counter such urban violence, and said he aimed to equip police cars with cameras and officers with "non lethal weapons."
Paris prosecutors opened an inquiry Tuesday into two young bloggers who urged French youths to riot and revolt against the police, a judicial official said.
The youths, a 16 year old French teen and an 18 year old with Ghanian nationality, were detained Monday in the Paris region, the official said.
They were to be placed under investigation, a step short of formal charges, for inciting harm to people and property over the Internet, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because French law bars the disclosure of information from ongoing investigations.
The charge carries a risk of up to five years in prison and a euro45000 (US$52800) fine.
The blog, called "hardcore," was run by the 18 year old, and the younger teen posted comments on it, the official said.
A 14 year old was also questioned Monday in the southern city of Aix en Provence and was released.
In 12 days of unrest in France, bloggers have posted appeals for calm alongside insults targeting police, threats of more violence and warnings that the unrest will feed support for France's anti immigration extreme right.
One of the blogs was called "sarkodead" a reference to law and order Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, who inflamed passions when he called troublemakers "scum."
Both "sarkodead" and "hardcore" were hosted by Skyblog, a branch of the popular Skyrock radio station.
The blogs were taken off line this weekend, and the radio station cooperated with police by giving information to track down people who incited violence, judicial officials said.

(Argentina Americas Summit Riots) PARIS A total of 897 vehicles were torched overnight from Friday to Saturday in whole France, including 656 in the Paris region, Paris prosecutor general Yves Bot on Saturday told Europe One Radio.
"We can see organized actions, a strategy," he said, calling the incidents "organized violence."
"There are organized gangs.
It is incontestable that it is done in a way that has shown coordination between them.
We can further more read on some blog sites that asking other French cities to join the movement in the Paris region," he said.

Drug addiction and transportation has been a serious social problem in Iran, which sits in the cross road linking drug producing Afghanistan and Pakistan and markets in the Persian Gulf states, Central Asia, western Europe and other regions.
Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy held a crisis meeting Friday on running riots that have plunged France into its worst explosion of urban violence in decades.
The number one and number two in President Jacques Chirac's embattled government huddled in Villepin's offices to discuss ways to tackle the troubles, which were headed into their ninth straight night with 30 vehicles being set alight in the Bobigny suburb east of the capital even as the ministers met.
Gangs of youths have gone on the rampage since October 27, when two teenagers were electrocuted in a tough, low income suburb north of Paris as they hid in an electrical sub station to flee a police identity check.
The riots have spread each night, eventually surrounding Paris then, overnight Thursday, flaring also in Marseille, Dijon and in Normandy and even in central parts of the capital itself.
Overwhelmed police have found themselves powerless to stop the conflagration, which has seen over 1000 vehicles torched and more than 200 people arrested amid fears that the country's racial and social divisions were fuelling the violence, the worst seen since a 1968 student revolt.
As the violence has progressed, it has taken on an increasingly dangerous tone, with widespread fire bombings, occasional shots fired at riot squads and prosecutors revealing that a handicapped woman was deliberately set on fire.
According to prosecutors Friday, a 56 year old woman was unable to get off a bus targeted by a Molotov cocktail late Wednesday in the northern Paris suburb of Sevran.
She was allegedly doused with petrol by one youth, then others threw a flaming rag on her.
Rescued by the driver, she was taken to hospital with severe burns to 20 percent of her body.
Overnight Thursday, more than 600 vehicles and several businesses were set on fire, and 78 people arrested in the Paris area, according to police.
Most of the arson has happened in the low income neighbourhoods that lie well outside the capital, far from its famous monuments and tourist sights, although seven cars were also burnt in poorer northern and eastern districts in central Paris overnight Thursday.
Those responsible are groups of young Muslim men, the sons of families from France's former Arab and African colonial territories, who have said in interviews that they are protesting economic misery, racial discrimination and provocative policing.
The leader of one police union, Bruno Beschizza, described the riots as "urban terrorism", led by a radicalised minority of criminals and "Islamic radicals".
Sarkozy, who harbours ambitions of becoming president in 2007 elections, has claimed that they are being orchestrated by unknown organisers.
But police commanders contradicted him Friday, saying "there was nothing to support the existence of an organisation behind the riots" and added that speculation of "a radical Islamic influence is baseless."
Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe of the opposition Socialist Party warned against hastily lumping together "one religion, Islam, and a few extremists" in apportioning blame.
Nevertheless, the intensity and prolificacy of the violence has badly rattled the government, making it waver between the "zero tolerance" policies of Sarkozy and calls for a more conciliatory approach.
Marine Le Pen, daughter of extreme right politician Jean Marie Le Pen and deputy leader of his anti immigration National Front party, called for a state of emergency to be declared in the worst hit areas.
Police detained 14 people Saturday after a second night of rioting that broke out in a working class Paris suburb following the deaths of two youths who were electrocuted while trying to evade police, officials said.
Hundreds of angry youths torched parked cars and threw rocks at police overnight in Clichy sous Bois, north of the capital, lightly injuring 15 officers and a journalist, officials said.
Mobile police units were called in after assailants opened fire on a police riot vehicle, and restored order around 2 a.m. About 300 police were remaining on site until further notice, officials said.
Dozens of local residents held a peaceful march after daybreak Saturday between City Hall and the electrical transformer where the youths died seeking cover Thursday evening.
The regional government said about 400 youths took part in the rioting overnight, but city officials insisted that estimate was too high.
Major French TV networks led their afternoon newscasts with images of the violence, showing officers firing tear gas and rowdy youths throwing rocks and overturning large trash bins.
Nineteen people were arrested, five were later released, officials said.
At Saturday's march, Mayor Claude Dilain called for calm, urging the public to "remain dignified" amid lingering anger over the deaths of the 15 and 17 year old boys.
About a dozen teens, wearing T shirts with the words "Dead for Nothing" written on them, marched at the front as the demonstrators walked past a string of charred vehicles.
Speaking to The Associated Press by telephone, Deputy Mayor Olivier Klein said: "We are all in shock."
"Unfortunately, many of our youths face tough social situations, and it is true that the deaths of these two other youths upsets them a lot," he added.
"The anger and sadness are legitimate but must not translate into acts of violence."
A first rampage broke out Thursday night after youths attacked firefighters called in to help the two victims and a third youth who was later hospitalized with serious burns.
Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy said police denied having chased the two youths and had arrived in the area to investigate an attempted robbery.
State prosecutor Francois Molins, who is investigating the incident, said the youths had fled police on the mistaken idea that they were being pursued.
"The important element is what the third youth said," Molins told reporters.
"Some others began running and started saying that police were coming, and that triggered the youths to flee."
"They thought they were being chased, when they weren't," he added.
Sarkozy has made cracking down on crime a priority.
This week, he announced new measures to deploy thousands of riot police to the country's toughest neighborhoods and equip police night patrols with video cameras.
The recent riots in the French capital claimed Monday the first death as a man died of his injuries at a hospital after he was beaten in the riots, officials said.
A spokesman for the Interior Ministry confirmed the death of Jean Jacques Le Chenadec but gave no other details.
The man was attacked by a youth outside his home when he rushed out of his apartment to distinguish the fire on a garbage can, said Alain Rahmouni, a national police spokesman.
He was in a coma after the attack.
French police said Monday that a total of 1408 vehicles were torched and 395 arrests made overnight in a riot across the country.
These are the highest figures recorded since the troubles broke out on Oct 27.
At least 1295 vehicles were burned and 312 people arrested during the night from Saturday to Sunday, police said in a statement.
The violence was triggered after the accidental electrocution of two teenagers in an electrical substation when they tried to flee a police identity check in Clichy sous Bois, a northeast Paris suburb.
The riot has spread to 200 city suburbs and towns, including Marseille, Nice, Toulouse, Lille, Rennes, Rouen, Bordeaux and Montpellier and central Paris, French police said.
More than 30 police officers were injured in the violence, including two who were fired on.
Three men were jailed Monday after police clashed with youths in a Paris suburb for a fourth straight night, as angry residents accused police of throwing a teargas grenade at a mosque.
In all, 27 people have been arrested since the violence first erupted late Thursday night.
Two 25 year old men and another aged 27, detained on Friday during the worst of the rioting, were handed eight month jail sentences including two months' firm imprisonment for throwing projectiles at police officers.
Five other adults were due to appear before the judge north of Paris later Monday, while three teenagers were to appear before a children's court judge.
The latest night of rioting in the northeastern suburb of Clichy sous Bois, left eight cars and 16 rubbish bins torched, adding to dozens of other vehicles that were incinerated in the preceding rampages.
There were no reports of civilian casualties but six police officers were slightly injured.
As with the previous nights of rioting, the violence dissipated before dawn and the suburb was calm during the day Monday.
The unrest was originally triggered when two teenagers, aged 15 and 17, died by electrocution on Thursday after they scaled the wall of an electrical relay station and touched a transformer.
Molins said the boys thought they were being chased by police, but authorities have denied that was the case.
Hundreds of the suburb's residents held a peaceful march Saturday in memory of the teenagers, with groups of youths wearing tee shirts marked "Dead for Nothing".
A lawyer representing the families of the victims, Jean Pierre Mignard, asked: "Why did these young people, who had done nothing wrong, feel sufficiently threatened to enter a dangerous site, climb over a 2.5 metre (six foot) barbed wire covered wall and hide inside a turbine?"
The clashes have pitted youths at times several hundred of them against police, leaving a total of 23 officers injured.
Clichy sous Bois is a low rent, high immigration district with a large share of public housing and a history of social problems.
A police teargas grenade thrown into the local mosque near to which "100 to 150 youths were looking for a fight," according to departmental security spokesman Jean Luc Sidot looked certain to worsen the running conflict.
Muslims inside the building accused police of firing the weapon into a place of worship.
Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy confirmed that the grenade was of the type used by riot squads, but said "that does not mean that it was fired by a police officer."
An inquiry was underway into the incident, he said, adding that he would speak with the mosque's imam, or prayer leader.
The families of the victims on Monday turned down an invitation to meet Sarkozy, and slammed the reported teargas incident as "disrespectful".
"We are asking for calm, we are asking for justice and we are asking for the riot police to leave," Siyakah Traore, brother of one of the victims, told a press conference at the mosque.
Sarkozy did, however, meet five of the victims' friends, who agreed to call for an end to the violence.
Opposition and rights campaigners said the riots were fuelled by tough new French anti crime policies espoused by Sarkozy, who vowed to wage a "war without mercy" on crime in the Paris suburbs just a week before the rampages.
Sarkozy repeated on Monday that he was "totally determined" to combat the violence.
The main police union described the riots as "guerrilla" violence and urged politicians to avoid "putting fuel on the fire" by scoring points against each other over the clashes.
Angry French Arab youths clashed with police and firefighters outside Paris late Wednesday in the worst of seven consecutive nights of violence set off by the accidental death of two teenagers.
By late Thursday, more cars were burning in at least one of the city's northern suburbs.
Gunshots were fired at police officers and firefighters in three separate incidents Wednesday night, said Prefect Jean Francois Cordet, the government's top official in Seine St. Denis, a department north of Paris that includes a belt of working class neighborhoods with a large immigrant population.
In the clashes on Wednesday night, a police station was ransacked, a garage was set on fire and a shopping center and two schools were vandalized, Cordet said.
Riot police forces have used tear gas and rubber bullets to repel the attacks.
Traffic was halted Thursday morning on a commuter rail line linking Paris to Charles de Gaulle airport after stone throwing rioters attacked two trains.
One passenger was slightly injured by broken glass, according to local news reports.
The violence picked up again as night fell over the capital with burning cars reported in the suburb of Stains.
Rampaging gangs have torched more than 200 cars in the past week, and dozens of firefighters and police officers have been injured, none seriously, since the deaths of two youths.
Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, who canceled a trip to Canada this week because of the violence, urged citizens and the police to restore order.
"Law and order will have the last word," he told senators on Thursday.
The continuing violence has embarrassed the government and isolated the country's tough talking anti crime interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, whom many people believe exacerbated the situation with his vow to "clean out" the troubled neighborhoods.
The interior minister's initiative has been met with scorn by many people in the neighborhoods, who say they are being stigmatized by his campaign and that the increased police presence has resulted in harassment.
The latest violence began in the suburb of Clichy sous Bois a week ago after two teenagers were electrocuted by a power transformer while hiding from police.
Local youths, who believed police had chased the boys into the transformer's enclosure, took to the streets, setting cars on fire in protest.
A preliminary government inquiry has since found that the youths were not being pursued by the police.
The report, released by the Interior Ministry on Thursday, stated that a third boy who survived the incident said he and his friends were aware of the danger when they entered the transformer's enclosure.
The report suggested that the boys were hiding from the police because one of those who died had a record of armed robbery and the other was among a group that had broken into a construction site earlier that evening.
The continuing unrest appears to be fueled less by perceived police brutality than by the frustration of young men who have no work and see little hope for the future.
As night falls, residents turned sentinels are setting off on rounds of their riot hit towns looking to prevent more arson and attacks.
Several towns in the suburbs of Paris and elsewhere are organizing themselves to restore order after France's worst violence since the May 1968 student riots.
Unlike police, the key to their success is gentle persuasion and a watchful eye.
"We are not Rambos!"
Manuel Aeschliman, the mayor of this town northwest of Paris, reminds a dozen volunteers as they set off for their rounds.
"No intervention: If you see something, call it in."
In cities across France, residents are holding overnight vigils in their homes and in public buildings liable to come under attack.
Aeschliman, a conservative politician close to hard line Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, has been rounding up his neighborhood watch team at sunset since rioters set fire to a dozen cars and a warehouse last week.
The group of stocky men and a couple women take turns patrolling until dawn, splitting into teams of two armed with nothing more than a fire extinguisher.
They shun the tag of vigilante, saying they are merely concerned citizens out to dissuade rioters and help an overwhelmed police.
"This is a quiet town, it's pretty rare for anything to happen here," said Marc, a 43 year old architect, as he set off in his car with student Capucine.
Nonetheless, they both declined to give their last names, saying they did not want to be branded as informers.
All the volunteers patrolling Asnieres on Tuesday night were white, unlike the majority of the rioters, many of them French born children of immigrants fed up with discrimination and bleak prospects in the projects.
In the suburb of Kremlin Bicetre, south of Paris, residents of the Martinets housing complex spontaneously banded together after violent clashes between rioters and police at the weekend left 50 cars torched.
"We sleep in turns, one night out of two," said Muriel Prudent, 53, who has been living in a small house between the towering housing blocks and a gas station for more than 25 years.
"We are all sticking together, it's important right now."
Her neighbor Claude is afraid to walk the streets at night.
He watches the youths from the safety of his darkened first floor window and warns neighbors by telephone if he sees anything suspect.
"We are jumpy.
Around us, everything has burned.
It is no wonder we are scared," said shopkeeper Roland, a canister of tear gas tucked a jacket pocket.
Elsewhere, volunteers are holding overnight vigils in public buildings likely to come under attack.
Lights turned on full blast to advertise their presence, they cheerfully share pizza and sodas and talk through the night.
"We might as well welcome young people and residents and gather to talk," said Helene Moctar, 19, who runs the "Le Village" youth center in Saint Martin d'Heres, a town of 30000 near the southern city of Grenoble.
"We are all nonviolent and I think that all these initiatives, even if they don't stop the violence, limit the damage."
The French government was to meet Monday on whether to extend a state of emergency in a number of places to tackle more than two weeks of urban unrest as the number of attacks was dropping nationwide.
An overnight curfew was still in force in 40 municipalities and authorities in the southeastern city of Lyon banned public gatherings in order to head off a repeat of clashes in the historic centre.
Police said no incident was reported in France's third largest city Sunday afternoon but 15 cars were set ablaze during the day and three people who were carrying gasoline (petrol) were detained for questioning.
In the region around the southern city of Toulouse 12 vehicles were torched and 10 people detained while 12 cars were set ablaze in the Paris suburbs.
In the northeastern Alsace and Lorraine regions, nine cars were gutted by fire, compared to 13 the previous night.
Since the start of the unrest 2652 arrests have been made and 375 people have been sent to prison.
The European Union pledged to release 50 million euros (58 million dollars) for urban programmes to improve conditions in France's riot hit areas, the EU executive president Jose Manuel Barroso said before a meeting with French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin late Sunday.
National police chief Michel Gaudin said there was "a major easing off.
"Things should begin to get rapidly back to normal," he added.
According to figures compiled before the riots by the police intelligence service RG, some 28000 cars were burned in the first 10 months of the year making an average of 650 a week, most of which were destroyed at weekends.
The centre of Paris remained calm after the authorities banned public meetings there on Saturday, fearing an influx of youth gangs from the suburbs.
In the end there was no sign of trouble, and the capital's outskirts were also relatively quiet.
A government official also spoke of cautious optimism.
"We were expecting a hot night, but it was not as busy as he feared.
We feared problems in Paris but there were none.
The slowdown is now established, and things should be easier to control," the senior official said.
The assembly bans in Paris and Lyon were imposed under emergency legislation activated by the government of President Jacques Chirac on Tuesday in response to the worst outbreak of urban violence in France since the student uprising of May 1968.
The same emergency law was used to impose overnight curfews in seven regions Saturday night, including Lyon, Nice on the Riviera and Rouen in Normandy.
Under the orders all unaccompanied children under 16 are banned from leaving their homes after 10:00 pm (2100 GMT).
The violence in France's delapidated out of town tenement estates was sparked by the accidental deaths of two teenagers who hid in an electricity sub station in the Paris suburb of Clichy sous Bois after an encounter with police.
More than 8000 cars have been burned since and numerous businesses and public buildings gutted by gangs of youths who are mainly from the country's Arab and black minorities.
Far right leader Jean Marie Le Pen in an interview on the private radio station RTL1 on Sunday blamed the rioting on "uncontrolled immigration from the Third World" and, while endorsing the use of curfews, he described the government response as insufficient.
Le Pen, 77, was to speak at a rally of France's National Front party in central Paris Monday evening.
Residents from riot torn suburbs were to march in Paris on Friday Armistice Day, marking the end of WWI waving white handkerchiefs to call for an end to more than two weeks of violence.
President Jacques Chirac acknowledged Thursday that France must confront the inequalities and discrimination that fueled the unrest.
The violence continued to abate on its 15th night Thursday Friday under state of emergency measures and heavy policing, with fewer skirmishes and fewer cars burned, national police spokeswoman Catherine Casteran said.
Police, meanwhile, suspended eight officers, two of them suspected of beating a man detained during the riots.
"Things are calming," Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy said Thursday on France 2 television.
"But that doesn't mean it won't restart."
Chirac had kept largely silent about France's worst unrest since the 1968 student worker uprising: in two weeks of violence, he had spoken publicly on the crisis only once.
"There is a need to respond strongly and rapidly to the undeniable problems faced by many residents of underprivileged neighborhoods around our cities," Chirac told a news conference.
"Whatever our origins, we are all the children of the Republic, and we can all expect the same rights."
Finance Minister Thierry Breton said the government was considering relaxing restrictions on highly regulated service industries and business startups to help create jobs in poor suburbs, in an interview published Friday.
"We have put a lot of money into the suburbs over the past 20 years," Breton was quoted as saying by The Financial Times.
"But obviously it wasn't enough.
We need to work on how to create more jobs and growth in those areas."
The unrest, which started among youths in the northeastern suburban Paris town of Clichy sous Bois angry over the accidental electrocution deaths of two teenagers grew into a nationwide wave of arson and nightly clashes between rioters armed with firebombs and police retaliating with tear gas.
The crisis has led to collective soul searching about France's failure to integrate its African and Muslim minorities.
Anger about high unemployment and discrimination has fanned frustration among the French born children of immigrants from France's former colonies.
One 20 year old who grew up in Clichy sous Bois said he had stopped looking for a job and joined the rampage.
"Maybe I burnt cars, I know it's not very nice of me, but to be honest, I am happy that things heated up everywhere to let everybody know that we are sick of it," said Ahmed Zbeul, hanging around a suburban courthouse to support friends on trial for theft.
Residents representing about 160 suburban communities were to assemble at 3 p.m. (1400GMT) on Friday at the Peace Wall on the Champs de Mars, near the Eiffel Tower, for a mass peace march.
We "want an immediate end to the violence and for peace to return to the neighborhoods where our parents, brothers and sisters have lived for the past two weeks in a climate of uncertainty," the march's organizers, Banlieus Respects, said in a statement.
Sarkozy, the interior minister, vowed to dismantle gangs and bands of drug traffickers that, he said, make up a tiny minority but poison everyone's lives.
Sarkozy told France 2 television he stood by comments he made referring to suburban troublemakers as "scum," but he was referring to a minority, not "all youths."
The government has toughened its stance against rioters, Sarkozy said local authorities have been instructed to deport foreigners convicted of involvement.
The president of anti racism group SOS Racisme said it had filed a complaint to the Council of State, France's highest administrative body, calling Sarkozy's proposal illegal.
The council had 48 hours to respond.
In the northern Paris suburb of La Courneuve, two police officers suspected of dealing "unwarranted blows" to a man taken in for questioning, the Interior Ministry said.
The officers were suspended along with six others suspected of witnessing the incident Monday.
The victim had "superficial lesions" on the forehead and the right foot, the ministry said.
A 12 day state of emergency went into effect Wednesday, paving the way for cities to impose curfews if they deem it necessary.
But most regional governments have not introduced them.
The Mediterranean resort region of Alpes Maritime imposed curfews for minors in 21 towns, a day later, the measure was lifted Thursday in seven of them, including Cannes.
In Paris and much of the rest of the country the state of emergency has had no perceptible effect.
So far, Justice Minister Pascal Clement said, two people have been arrested for violating curfews.
National Police Chief Michel Gaudin noted a "very sharp drop" in acts of violence from Wednesday Thursday, with 482 vehicles burned down from 617 the night before.
At the height of the violence last weekend, rioters torched nearly 3000 cars in two nights.
The number of incidents has dropped every night since.
Vandals had burned 325 vehicles overnight Thursday Friday as of 3:30 a.m. (0230GMT), the national police said.
Police have made more than 3000 arrests over two weeks, the interior minister said Thursday.
A total of 364 people, including 73 minors, have been imprisoned, said the justice minister.
Associated Press writers Angela Doland, Joelle Diderich, Jamey Keaten, and John Leicester in Paris contributed to this report.
The French government on Monday approved an extension of emergency powers for three months in order to subdue a wave of rioting in poor city suburbs around the country.
Meeting under the chairmanship of President Jacques Chirac, the cabinet agreed on a bill to maintain the state of emergency which came into effect last Wednesday under a 50 year old law.
The bill will be put to parliament Tuesday.
Chirac said the extension was "a strictly temporary measure which will be applied only where it is strictly necessary," according to government spokesman Jean Francois Cope.
The state of emergency applies in most of the country's riot hit towns and cities, but has been invoked sparingly by the authorities.
Some 30 localities are under nightly curfews for under 16 year olds, and two temporary bans on public gatherings have been imposed in Paris and Lyon.
France was on high alert Friday for a possible upsurge of violence as the country headed into a long holiday weekend, two weeks after rioting broke out in a run down suburb of the capital.
Rioters torched 463 cars across the country overnight and 201 people were arrested, figures almost identical to the previous night, national police said.
The violence was still in marked decrease from the peak of the trouble on Sunday, when more than 1400 cars were set alight across the country.
Seven policeman were injured in overnight clashes with youths, four of them in the eastern city of Lyon.
Exceptional security measures have been taken in the capital for Armistice Day commemorations to take place later Friday, with some 2200 police deployed for the event.
President Jacques Chirac and Defense Minister Michele Alliot Marie were to attend the ceremonies on the capital's Champs Elysees avenue.
Around the country, 12000 police and gendarmes were to remain mobilised over the weekend.
France has been rocked by two weeks of car burnings, arson attacks and rioting carried out mostly by young Arab and black residents of poor suburban residential estates, who complain of economic misery and racial discrimination.
The violence erupted following the accidental deaths of two teenagers electrocuted while hiding from police in an electrical sub station.
Calm has been gradually returning to French cities after the government declared a state of emergency on Tuesday allowing the imposition of curfews, which have been declared in some 30 towns and cities.
Curfews for unaccompanied children under the age of 16 were still in effect in more than 20 towns on Friday.
In his second public appearance since the rioting began on October 27, Chirac said Thursday that the country needed to learn lessons from the two weeks of unrest, while stressing the need to restore order.
"When the time comes and order has been established, it will be necessary to draw all the consequences from this crisis and do it with much courage and lucidity," he said.
"Whatever our origins we are all children of the republic.
We can all claim the same rights but must of course all accept the same duties," he said.
Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy said he would not permit any police excesses, after eight officers were suspended pending an investigation into an alleged assault on a young man in a Paris suburb.
Controversy has surrounded a call by the tough talking Sarkozy for foreigners convicted over the rioting to be deported a measure denounced by left wing parties and campaigning groups as a breach of human rights.
Sarkozy also said on television Thursday he had no regrets about using the word "rabble" to refer to young troublemakers in poor suburbs a comment seen as having contributed to the eruption of violence.
"When I say they are rabble, that's what they call themselves," the minister stressed.
"Let's stop calling them youngsters.
If you call hoodlums 'youngsters' you risk making generalisations about young people."
Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin has outlined a twin track initiative to defuse the unrest, invoking emergency measures under a law dating back to the Algerian war, as well as unveiling a package of social assistance for stricken areas.
Finance Minister Thierry Breton meanwhile told Britain's Financial Times business daily Friday that France could lift restrictions on service industries and business start ups to create jobs in the riot hit suburbs.
Breton said he would present the prime minister with a batch of fresh ideas once the violence dies down.
A ban on public meetings imposed by the French government to avert fresh violence was expected to be lifted in Paris Sunday morning but youths clashed with riot police in the country's second city Lyon.
The Paris ban, which came into force at 10:00 am (0900 GMT) Saturday, lasts till Sunday at 8:00 am (0700 GMT) and prohibits "all meetings likely to start or fuel disorder."
No incidents were reported in Paris but police late Saturday said cars were set alight in the cities of Toulouse, in the south, as well as Lyon and the area of St. Etienne in the southeast.
Police said the situation in suburban areas throughout France was "much calmer" than on previous nights, with 315 vehicles torched by 4:00 am (0300 GMT) Sunday compared to 384 at the same time Saturday.
A total 161 suspects were detained, against 162 at the same time the previous night.
During the 17th night of rioting two police officers were injured.
One of them was hospitalized after being hit by a metal ball in the Paris suburb of La Courneuve.
Using emergency powers dating back to the time of the Algerian civil war, the government deployed more than 2000 police and gendarmes in the capital after a series of Internet and text messages calling for violence were intercepted.
Acting under an ordinance that banned "all meetings likely to start or fuel disorder" police fanned out along main shopping streets and in the main railway stations.
They were inspected on the Champs Elysees by Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, whose by now famous threat to power hose the "rabble" in the racially mixed Paris suburbs helped fuel a two week nationwide orgy of rioting.
Paris has largely been spared the orgy of violence in suburbs around the capital and other cities, including the torching of thousands of cars and arson attacks on schools, kindergartens, gymnasiums and public buildings.
But for the first time Saturday afternoon, clashes between police and rioters erupted in the heart of a major French city, Lyon, where officers used teargas to disperse stone throwing youths in the historic Place Bellecour in the city centre.
By late evening it was reported that 11 youths had been arrested in Lyon, with nine kept in custody after two hours of clashes with police in the afternoon.
The number of car burnings also increased in Lyon with 24 cars set alight in what liked like a resurgence of violence in the southeastern city.
Lyon authorities ordered a 10:00 pm to 6:00 am (2100 GMT to 0500 GMT) curfew in the city centre and 10 other localities for unaccompanied children under 16 for until Monday morning.
Despite the emergency measures, police allowed peaceful demonstrations to go ahead, and several hundred people massed close to the police headquarters in the heart of Paris to protest "discrimination" against youths in the suburbs.
Many called for Sarkozy's resignation.
Another peaceful demonstration against the emergency laws was held in Toulouse.
But car burnings began again in the southwestern city once the sun went down, with four vehicles going up in flames.
The violence, described as the worst in France since May 1968, erupted after the accidental deaths of two youths who were electrocuted in an electrical sub station where they were hiding from police.
Meanwhile the interior ministry announced that procedures are under way to expel foreign nationals convicted of rioting after the courts rejected an objection lodged by an anti racist group.
Capt. Eric Peterle emerged from the fray on a recent night carrying a heavy grate about the size of his head.
An hour before, a rioter had torn the grate from the drain of an apartment building and hurled it at the riot squad commander.
When Peterle returned to headquarters, the object in his brawny hand became evidence of a crime and of the nihilistic fury of France's worst riots in decades.
Peterle's unit had first seen action in the epicenter of the unrest, the grim gangways of housing projects in Clichy Sous Bois near Paris.
Later, they redeployed about 30 miles south to this seemingly tranquil, stone walled town where metropolitan sprawl ends in meadows.
In both places, rioters bombarded them with everything from rocks, bricks and Molotov cocktails to shopping carts and the wreckage of a telephone booth.
"Luckily, the guy who threw this thing missed," said Peterle, a close cropped 42 year old with an armor plated build forged in 17 years of close quarters combat.
While the anti riot officers brawled in the glare of flames and cameras, officers of the national police intelligence division led the shadow war.
In a discreet headquarters near Paris last week, rumpled and unshaven officers in jeans, sweaters and scarves worked a legion of informants.
There was a barrage of tips and rumors: firebombs stockpiled in a basement, arsonists scheming hit and run incursions far from the riot zones, Islamic fundamentalists keeping a mysteriously low profile.
The officers consulted with mayors, businessmen, teachers, imams.
Their unique knowledge of the landscape made them the brains of a battle against a guerrilla style foe in which at least 208 officers were injured.
In conversations over the past two weeks of violence, a dozen officers from different units, ranks and cities said they were exhausted, dismayed but not surprised by the nationwide rampage.
For years, the officers said, the police had warned that France's immigrant dominated slums were on the verge of explosion, a slow motion riot about to fast forward.
Culture clashes and economic woes had created a lost generation of mostly Muslim youths seething with hostility toward the state.
Wrong headed ideology had caused governments to pull back from low income housing projects allowing parallel societies ruled by criminal and extremist networks to flourish, officers said.
And several veterans agree with critics who say that France's rigid, paramilitary policing culture aggravated tensions between youths and officers.
Even before the riots, an average of 3500 cars a month were burned nationwide.
"We didn't predict the hour and the day," said a police intelligence chief, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons.
"But it was all reported: the chasm between youths and society, the power of the criminal economy, the isolation of the projects where it is basically youths vs. cops.
Because there is nothing.
No movie theaters, no restaurants, nothing to do.
The only face of the state is the police."
The overall violence has declined markedly from its peak, but it continued this weekend, mainly in provincial regions.
France's police are proud of their restraint and discipline during the onslaught.
Remarkably, police have not fired a single shot, even when shot at on half a dozen occasions.
There has only been one death, a retiree beaten by a youth, and few serious injuries.
On the other hand, critics say defects of French policing were among the fuses for the explosion.
The French police excel at intelligence, investigations and crowd control, say academic experts and European and U.S. investigators.
But in a hierarchical system, intelligence tends to flow up the command chain, not to other officers in the field.
And experts say police here are weaker at basic beat cop patrolling, an area vital to the dramatic reduction of crime and unrest in American cities in the past decade.
Like other European countries, the French system differs greatly from the city police departments of the United States.
The police here are a national force led by chiefs in Paris.
In the provinces, police forces answer not to mayors but to civilian regional administrators known as prefects.
It's routine for officers, many of whom come from small cities or towns, to start their careers in far off regions and spend their careers trying to land a post closer to home.
In keeping with the military model, Peterle's riot division is housed in bases outside big cities and dispatched all over the country to handle unrest, demonstrations or security for major events.
For patrol officers, the violent, dilapidated housing projects in the industrial belt around Paris are often the first assignment.
Rookies find themselves stuck in a harrowing job in an expensive region.
They are often scared and bewildered by the mosaic of foreign cultures in the projects: African women in colorful tribal robes, aging bearded Algerians in Islamic garb, defiant second and third generation youths in hip hop regalia.
In turn, the youths often see police as unwanted representatives of a distant state, said Dominique Monjardet, a sociologist at the National Center for Scientific Research.
"The urban patrol officer is not an element of the community like the shop owner, the bus driver," Monjardet said.
"For the police, all local contact is seen as potentially corrupting,The rookies don't know the turf.
They don't like it.
They don't know how to handle it.
They have three years to spend there and they are counting the days.
They are young, so it becomes youths against youths, like two gangs."
(Begin optional trim) French authorities have attempted reforms similar to those in the United States, such as "community policing" and Compstat, a results driven management technique pioneered by Los Angeles Police Chief Bill Bratton in New York.
But the experiments have been half hearted, Monjardet said.
In fact, many beat cops see their mission as clear cut.
"In the media it's always analysis, sociology," said Cmdr. Eric Slangen, who from headquarters here in Melun oversees patrol operations in a vast sector east and south of Paris.
"Police have to focus on facts, because we can't analyze causes, we aren't there for that.
We are there to see what happens and react and arrest people,There's a tendency to ask police to play bigger role than the one we have."
(End optional trim) Often, the top brass in Paris give patrol divisions little support or direction, favoring prized detective units that investigate major crimes such as armed robbery, mafias and terrorism, Monjardet said.
As a result, most beat cops have few anti crime tools beyond stopping youths for repeated identity checks, which leads to complaints of harassment and discrimination, he said.
But Patrice Ribeiro of the Synergie Officiers police union said that political ideology has handcuffed police during the past three decades, in effect handing over public housing to entrenched criminal networks that deal in drugs and stolen goods.
The trend began with leftist governments in the 1980s and continued with rightist leaders, he said.
"For years, we had instructions not to go into the projects," Ribeiro said.
"There was an ideology that it was a provocation.
So we left a lot of people with the idea that it was their turf and police weren't supposed to intrude,We abandoned all those people, and most of them are honest people.
We abandoned them in neighborhoods that have rotted."
Two weeks after an outbreak of urban rioting in France, sparked by anger in Paris's poor outer suburbs over the accidental deaths of two teenagers, here are the key facts and figures about the violence.
HOTSPOTS: Some 300 towns and cities were affected at the height of the riots, particularly the outer Parisian suburbs of Clichy sous Bois, Aulnay sous Bois, Saint Denis and Grigny.
Regional cities hardest hit included Evreux, west of Paris, Lille in the north, central Saint Etienne and Toulouse in the southwest.
Other outbreaks occurred in Nice, Marseille, Nimes, Montpellier, Perpignan and Pau in the south, Bordeaux, Nantes and Rennes in the west, Clermont Ferrand, Tours and Lyon in central France, Rouen and Le Havre in Normandy, and Strasbourg to the east.
Around 11500 police and gendarmes were mobilised throughout the country.
Seven helicopters were deployed in the Ile de France region encompassing Paris.
VICTIMS: Retiree Jean Jacques Le Chenadec, 61, died Monday three days after being punched near his apartment building northeast of Paris.
More than 115 residents, police and firefighters have been injured.
A firefighter sustained serious facial burns from a Molotov cocktail and a handicapped woman was badly burnt when youths set fire to a bus.
A rioter lost a hand attempting to throw a tear gas canister back at riot police.
A female South Korean reporter was kicked unconscious and Italian and Russian journalists were attacked while reporting on the violence.
CURFEWS: Twenty five out of 100 French departments have been given powers to impose curfews after the government declared a state of emergency.
Curfews were declared Wednesday in 32 towns and cities, including Nice on the French Riviera, Amiens in the north, Rouen, Le Havre and Evreux in the northwest and the Loire Valley city of Orleans.
They were joined by the eastern town of Belfort on Thursday.
The measure was lifted in seven Riviera towns on Thursday.
No curfews have been imposed in Paris itself.
The outer Parisian suburbs of Le Raincy and Savigny sur Orge on Tuesday invoked municipal curfews banning children under 16 from the streets late at night unless accompanied by adults.
DAMAGE: More than 7500 vehicles have been torched and dozens of buses, schools, gymnasiums, nurseries, libraries, shops and businesses destroyed in arson attacks.
INSURANCE BILL: The two weeks of car burnings and arson are already set to cost the insurance industry some 200 million euros (235 million dollars), according to the French insurers' federation.
Insurers have said the average payout for a car is 3000 euros (3500 dollars) although not all will qualify for compensation.
ARRESTS: Police have made more than 2200 arrests, the youngest aged 10.
One third have been released without charge and courts have handed down jail terms to 260 adults.
In addition, 348 minors have been brought before children's tribunals, 73 of whom have been ordered detained.
The French cabinet Monday approved a bill to extend emergency police powers for three months in response to the violence that has been raging in poor city suburbs.

Sunday, November 13: Authorities in Lyon impose a ban on public meetings during the day.
Police are confident things are returning to normal.
Far right leader Jean Marie Le Pen says the riots are the result of massive immigration fom the Third World.
Emergency powers permitting the imposition of curfews were invoked in relatively few French towns Wednesday, after the previous night's violence lent hope that two weeks of rioting could be on the wane.
State governors declared curfews in 32 towns and cities, two thirds of them on the Mediterranean coast, to curtail unrest which had spread to some 300 areas across the country at its peak.
However, that was only a fraction of the local authorities who could have invoked their new powers, and only five of the 25 regional departments allowed to do so have actually taken the step so far.
The French government on Tuesday invoked a 50 year old law to declare a state of emergency in 25 riot hit departments, leaving it to the discretion of state governors, or prefects, whether to enact curfews and other measures.
The first curfew imposed under the emergency powers went into effect Tuesday night in the northern city of Amiens.
On the same night though, the level of unrest across the country showed the first signs of abating with some 617 car burnings compared to more than 1100 the night before.
No curfew was imposed under the new powers anywhere in the Paris region, where the violence broke out on October 27.
In the southern department of Alpes Maritimes, the authorities issued curfews for 21 cities and towns on the Mediterranean Riviera including Nice, Grasse, Antibes and Cannes.
The order bans unaccompanied children under 16 from leaving their homes between the hours of 10:00 pm and 5:00 am.
In addition 15 bars in Nice and Saint Laurent du Var were told to close during the same hours.
Similar curfews have been issued for the Normandy towns of Rouen, Le Havre and Elbeuf, part of the town of Evreux, 100 kilometres (60 miles) west of Paris.
In the Loire Valley south of Paris, a overnight curfew running from 9:00 pm to 6:00 am was declared in six towns, including the historic city of Orleans.
Orleans, along with the Paris suburbs of Savigny sur Orge and Raincy, had already issued similar orders under a separate administrative procedure.
Dennis Rader, the man police believe is the BTK serial killer, hid for more than 30 years in plain sight.
He lived in this suburb of Wichita, the city he is suspected of terrorizing, with a wife and two children.
He led a Cub Scout troop and was active in his Lutheran church.
As an ordinance enforcement officer for the local government, he could be seen measuring grass in a front yard with a tape measure to see if it was too long, a neighbor said.
On Saturday, police identified Rader as a suspect in the BTK killings and announced an end to their 31 year manhunt.
Although no charges have been filed, a jubilant collection of law enforcers and community leaders told a cheering crowd they were confident the long running case could now be closed.
Officials also said they connected two more deaths to BTK a self coined nickname that stands for "Bind, Torture, Kill" bringing his total to at least 10.
BTK stoked fears throughout the 1970s in Wichita, a manufacturing center with 350000 residents, with his grisly crimes and letters sent to police and media.
The killer stopped writing in the late 1970s but resurfaced about a year ago with a letter giving details of a 1986 slaying that had not previously linked to BTK.
In Park City, the suspect's neighbors said he helped elderly neighbors with yard work but described him as an unpleasant man who often went looking for reasons to cite his neighbors for violations of city codes.
Bill Lindsay, 38, lived behind Rader and said his wife caught Rader in their adjoining backyards filming the back of their house.
"He really acted really funny," said Lindsay, a truck driver.
"I'd be on the road and my wife would tell me, 'Dennis has been out again, taking his pictures.'"
Jason Day, 28, said his brother was in Rader's Cub Scout pack at the nearby Park City Baptist Church, but their mother pulled him out because of Rader.
"It was his demeanor," he said.
"He was so strange."
Messages left for Rader's family members were not returned on Saturday, and no one answered the door at the home of his in laws.
Rader was being held at an undisclosed location, and it was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer.
In Kansas, suspects generally appear before a judge for a status hearing within 48 hours of their arrest.
Prosecutor Nola Foulston said the death penalty would not apply to any crime committed between 1972 and 1994, when Kansas did not have the death penalty.
The BTK slayings began in 1974 with the strangulations of Joseph Otero, 38, his wife, Julie, 34, and their two children.
The six victims that followed were all women, and most were strangled.
Along with his grisly crimes, the killer terrorized Wichita by sending rambling letters to the media, including one in which he named himself BTK for "Bind them, Torture them, Kill them."
In another he complained, "How many do I have to kill before I get my name in the paper or some national attention?"
In several of the letters, BTK included clues to his identity.
Police had long believed BTK was a graduate of Wichita State University, as Rader was.
Letters sent in the past year included jewelry that police believed may have been taken from BTK's victims and the driver's license of one of the victims.
"He obviously was getting rid of his trophies, he was leaving us a wide open trail," said Richard LaMunyon, Wichita's police chief from 1963 to 1989.
"I think the ultimate goal was of him being caught."
At one point, investigators made a list of white men who graduated from Wichita State in the 1970s.
Officials said Rader's name likely was on that list, but he wasn't identified back then as a suspect.
BTK stopped communicating in 1979 and remained silent for more than two decades before re establishing contact last March with a letter to The Wichita Eagle about an unsolved 1986 killing.
The letter included a copy of the victim's driver's license and photos of her slain body.
The return address on the letter said it was from Bill Thomas Killman initials BTK.
Thousands of tips poured in, and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation gathered thousands of DNA swabs in connection with the investigation.
In the end, DNA evidence was the key to cracking the case, said Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.
"The way they made the link was some DNA evidence, that they had some DNA connection to the guy who they arrested," Sebelius said in an interview with The Associated Press.
She did not elaborate.
The two newly identified cases were similar to the early ones with one exception, Sedgwick County Sheriff Gary Steed said: The bodies had been removed from the crime scenes.
One of the victims lived on the same street as Rader.
"We as investigators keep an open mind.
But only now are we able to bring them together as BTK cases," he said.

WICHITA, Kan. People here had often wondered and worried about whether BTK, the elusive serial killer who taunted this city on and off for more than three decades, might be living right here, just beside them, all along.
On Saturday, as the authorities announced an arrest in one of the most notorious, puzzling string of crimes in recent history, they confirmed exactly what people in the Wichita area had feared: The man the police had arrested was a longtime neighbor, a leader at one of their churches, a father with a wife and two children, who had once, neighbors said, led a scouting troop for boys.
He was the suburban municipal employee who checked in to see that their dog was on a leash, their garbage can was tucked away, their grass was trimmed just so.
Inside a City Hall chamber packed with the families of victims, scores of police officers, some retired and gray now, and a long line of political leaders from the state, the police announced that they had arrested Dennis L. Rader, 59, of suburban Park City, as the suspect in the case of BTK, the name the killer had long ago selected for himself for his preferred method: bind, torture, kill.
"The bottom line: BTK is arrested," Chief Norman Williams of the Wichita police said, setting off only one of what would become multiple rounds of applause during the announcement that some law enforcement officials in the room said they had waited entire careers to hear.
The police said they pulled over Rader in his vehicle about a block from his home, 10 minutes north of downtown Wichita, just after noon on Friday.
He was taken into custody without fuss, the police said, and was being held at an "undisclosed location" on Saturday.
He is suspected, said Lt. Ken Landwehr, who worked the BTK mystery for years, in 10 killings two more than had been publicly attributed to BTK before Saturday.
Rader has not been charged, but officials said the district attorney's office here would be asked to consider filing charges next week.
For the families of the dead, the news marked an end of sorts, but also a difficult reminder of their unalterable losses and of how long they had waited.
Ruth Fox, the stepmother of Nancy Fox, who was bound and strangled with a nylon stocking in 1977, said she had been stricken by Rader's image.
"When I saw his picture this morning," she said, pausing for a long moment, "I just wanted to choke him."
"There's a sense of closure," she added, "to a degree."
A serial killer known as BTK may have taken a necklace from one of his victims in 1977 and given it to a woman he was dating at the time, authorities said Wednesday.
The killer has sent several letters to police since resurfacing last March after years of silence.
Police said that in one recent communication, he said he took items from the crime scene after killing Nancy Fox on Dec 8, 1977.
Police are looking for a necklace described as a gold chain with two pearls.
Authorities are asking anyone who may have seen the necklace or received a similar necklace as a gift in December 1977 or early 1978 to call the BTK tip line.
"It is not that unusual for serial killers to take mementos from the scene and perhaps the value to them is to help refresh their memory and relish the occasion," said Howard Brodsky, a Wichita psychologist who assisted in the BTK investigation in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
The killer's self coined nickname stands for "Bind, Torture, Kill."
He is linked to eight unsolved homicides that terrorized Wichita, the first in 1974.
Police have received more than 5000 tips since the killer resurfaced.
Brodsky said the idea that BTK had a girlfriend surprised him.
"Him trusting another woman doesn't go with my model of who he is, not necessarily that my model is correct," he said.
In March, The Wichita Eagle received a letter with information on an unsolved 1986 killing.
The letter contained a copy of the victim's driver's license and photos of her taken after she was slain.
It was the first communication from the killer in more than two decades, and police said it linked him to an eighth slaying.
The other seven people were slain in the 1970s, with BTK claiming responsibility for those deaths in letters to the newspaper and a television station.
For those gathered inside Christ Lutheran Church on Sunday morning, the lasting images of Dennis L. Rader were simple, sweet moments.
Just last Wednesday evening, for instance, he had stopped by the church to drop off spaghetti sauce and salad for a potluck dinner before he went to visit his mother at the hospital.
Even as Wichita voiced relief at the prospect that one of the most notorious serial killers in recent history might finally be behind bars, those who knew Rader, the man the police have accused of being the city's "BTK" killer, said they were beginning to experience new waves of bewilderment, confusion, betrayal and fear.
Michael G. Clark, the pastor at Christ Lutheran, where Rader, his wife, his mother and his in laws have been members for 30 years and where Rader began his elected term as president of the church council in January, said he was having difficulty grasping the possibility that the man the police arrested on Friday was the same one he knew so well.
Some members of the congregation wept during services Sunday, and crisis counselors arrived at the church by the afternoon.
Rader's wife, Paula, was in seclusion, the pastor said, in "a state of disbelief."
BTK, as the killer had dubbed himself in one of his rambling writings years ago, stood for bind, torture, kill.
On Sunday, the authorities here said that Rader, 59, had been booked into Sedgwick County's jail, where he was being held on a $10 million probable cause bond on suspicion of 10 first degree murders, dating from 1974 until 1991.
Prosecutors here will probably file formal charges against him this week, Georgia Cole, a spokeswoman for the Sedgwick County district attorney's office, said on Sunday.
While the arrest, residents here said, may have answered some of their biggest questions about the killer they had been wondering and worrying about for more than a generation, it also set off a new set of questions, small and large.
In a weekend news conference, law enforcement officials revealed almost nothing about why they focused on Rader and what evidence they might have against him.
In the information void, rumors and questions filled Wichita's airwaves and Internet chat rooms on Sunday: How had the police found him now, after so many years of looking?
Why had Park City's public library been suddenly shut down on Friday during Rader's arrest?
Who had supplied Rader's DNA sample that, according to comments by Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, allowed the authorities to link him to the crime scenes?
Police have arrested the alleged serial killer suspected of at least seven brutal slayings in Kansas starting in the 1970s, Kansas authorities announced Saturday.
Authorities said they had arrested 59 year old Dennis Rader, a citizen of Park City, Kansas, on Friday, after police pulled the man over in his vehicle during a "routine" stop.
"The bottom line: BTK is arrested," said Wichita police chief Norman Williams, describing the investigation as "the most intense and challenging" of his department's entire history.
"He is being held in an undisclosed location," Lieutenant Ken Landwehr said of the suspect, adding: "We will be approaching the district attorney's office next week ,to see if charges will be filed against this individual."
The Kansas serial killer who once referred to himself as "BTK," for "bind, torture, kill" is accused of murdering four women, two children and one man between 1974 and 1977.
The investigation was reopened in March 2004 after the killer, who had remained silent for decades, wrote to a local television station.
Among the information he gave at that time was an admission that he had killed another woman in the 1980s.
Police said Saturday that they were investigating the man's involvement in nine killings, including that April 1985 murder and one more killing in January 1991.
Authorities released a photograph of a smiling Rader on Saturday.
The balding man, wearing eyeglasses and sporting a moustache, was said to have lived on the same street as one of the victims.
A DNA test of sperm left at one of the murder victims' homes was analyzed in the 1980s but did not yield a match.
Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston said during Saturday's news conference that the investigation was still ongoing.
However, she said the files would be sealed once the investigation was closed, to ensure it remained as "pristine" as possible for court proceedings.
Foulston said the accused man will not be eligible for the death penalty because the murders occurred before Kansas reintroduced capital punishment in 1994.
The killer first struck in January 1974, murdering four members of the Otero family, a married couple and their 11 year old daughter and nine year old son.
Both children were strangled.
BTK began taunting police, bragging in the first of a series of letters to them that he had acted alone, after they arrested a suspect.
The letter, full of spelling mistakes, was concealed in a book at the local Wichita library.
The killer called the local newspaper, the Witchita Eagle, to tell reporters where to find it.
The suspect went on to murder three more women, all in their 20s.
Last week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a statement revealing that authorities who had re established communication with the killer after he began to contact the media in March 2004 had confirmed two letters that had been received as authentically coming from BTK.
One of them was a package containing the driver's license of Nancy Fox, a 25 year old woman killed in December 1977, two years before the killer went silent.
Wichita authorities attending Saturday's news conference appeared overjoyed to have made an arrest.
Wichita Mayor Carlos Mayans thanked the families of victims present at the gathering and told them that after three decades of waiting for an answer, "It's your day."
Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline said: "The full story of this investigation cannot be made known now to protect the integrity of the judicial process," but he added that "the full story really will never be known."
Wichita police announce arrest of suspect in BTK case By DAVID KLEPPER and LAURA BAUER The Kansas City Star WICHITA With six terse words Saturday, Police Chief Norman Williams unveiled what he hopes will be the solution to a mystery that has stymied authorities and gripped a community for 30 years.
"The bottom line: BTK is arrested," Williams said.
Dennis Rader, 59, of Park City, Kan., a Wichita suburb, was arrested without incident during a traffic stop Friday afternoon.
Although Rader has yet to be charged with any crime, authorities said Saturday they are confident the arrest will end the search for BTK, the serial killer who police now believe murdered 10 people between 1974 and 1991 and taunted authorities for their inability to catch him.
The announcement came shortly after 10 a.m. Saturday at a decidedly upbeat and celebratory press conference before a capacity crowd at the City Council chambers.
The press conference included numerous federal, state and local law enforcement officials, prosecutors and dozens of victims' family members.
Authorities released little information at the press conference concerning Rader's arrest and their investigation.
"We will not be discussing this case publicly," said Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston.
Authorities allege BTK, the macabre name the killer gave himself for his preferred method of homicide Bind, Torture, Kill is linked to 10 murders.
Originally investigators assumed only eight murders were the work of the serial killer, but on Saturday they announced two others, both in Park City.
Thousands of tips poured in, and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation conducted hundreds of DNA swabs in connection with the BTK investigation.
Investigators won't release details of what led to Rader's arrest.
Police Chief Williams later denied that anyone with the police department called Wichita Mayor Carlos Mayans about the DNA test.
Authorities wouldn't say where Rader, a Cub Scout leader who was active at his Lutheran church, is being held.
It was unclear whether Rader, who worked as a municipal codes enforcement supervisor in Park City, has an attorney yet.
Investigators said evidence will likely be presented to prosecutors this week, and that they would expect 10 murder charges to be filed.
Sitting in the front rows at the press conference were the families of victims, some of whom have waited decades for an arrest.
Charles Bright's daughter Kathryn Bright was 21 when she was stabbed to death in 1974.
BTK was waiting for her when she and her brother Kevin had returned to her home.
Kevin Bright was shot twice, but survived and managed to escape.
When Charles Bright heard Friday that a BTK suspect was in custody, "I was elated," he said.
He said he had doubts his daughter's murderer would ever be caught.
Asked what the arrest signified, Bright's wife Kay Bright had one word.
"Closure."
BTK's crimes are not eligible for the death penalty, because the murders occurred at times when the state had no capital punishment.
Some of BTK's lesser crimes home invasion, tampering with phone lines and restraint cannot be prosecuted because the statute of limitations on those crimes has expired.
But, as Foulston pointed out, "there is no statute of limitations on the crime of homicide."
The BTK task force included local and county police, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and others.
At Saturday's announcement, investigators thanked scores of agencies and individual investigators.
Investigators said their work slogged on despite the glare of intense public scrutiny and critics who questioned their methods.
"We knew that we had to get to this day," Chief Williams said.
",Doggone it, we did it."
In the year since BTK re emerged and once again dominated the local headlines, sales of home alarms doubled.
On Saturday, residents said they had become wearied by the search for a serial killer who lived among them.
As Williams said, residents wondered, "Is BTK my next door neighbor?"
In the trial that investigators say is sure to come, details of the 31 year mystery may finally come to light.
"You will come face to face with evil, and the horrific knowledge of what this evil did," Attorney General Phill Kline said at the press conference.
Kline was one of several speakers at the press conference, including U.S.
Rep Todd Tiahrt, city and state officials and representatives of several law enforcement agencies.
Before the press conference, dozens of victims' family members were brought in small groups before a gauntlet of television cameras.
Some family shielded their faces from the media.
The families were followed by grim faced investigators.
Outside, curious Wichita residents discussed what they hoped was the final chapter in the 31 year old mystery.
Kim Sloan, 35, a Wichita, got to City Hall at 8 a.m.
The homemaker is part of the "Catch BTK" online discussion board and website.
On Saturday she wore a "Catch BTK" button and admitted that she and a friend tried to find Rader's home at 4 a.m. Saturday.
"We want to know what makes him tick," she said.
Tom Andrews, 46, was in junior high when BTK claimed his first victims.
On Saturday, Andrews was at City Hall to take photos of the scene.
Andrews said his family and friends have speculated about BTK for years.
"He's like our Boston Strangler," Andrews said.
"This is kind of a once in a lifetime event," he said.
"At least you hope it is."
A 31 year manhunt for a serial killer who taunted police with letters about his crimes ended when authorities said they finally caught up with the man who called himself BTK and linked him to at least 10 murders.
"The bottom line: BTK is arrested," Wichita Police Chief Norman Williams said Saturday, setting off applause from a crowd that included family members of some of the victims.
The suspect was identified as Dennis L. Rader, a 59 year old city worker in nearby Park City, who was arrested Friday.
Police did not say how they identified Rader as a suspect or whether he has said anything since his arrest.
BTK a self coined nickname that stands for "Bind, Torture, Kill" stoked fears throughout the 1970s in Wichita, a manufacturing center with 350000 residents, about 180 miles (290 kilometers) southwest of Kansas City, Missouri.
Then the killer resurfaced about a year ago after 25 years of silence.
He had been linked to eight slayings between 1974 and 1986, but police said Saturday they had identified two more, from 1985 and 1991.
Rader, a Cub Scout leader who was active at his Lutheran church, lived with his wife, neighbors said.
Public records indicate they have two grown children.
Messages left for family members were not returned on Saturday, and no one answered the door at the home of his in laws.
A few neighbors recalled receiving small favors from Rader, but most interviewed Saturday said the municipal codes enforcement supervisor was an unpleasant man who often went looking for reasons to cite his neighbors for violations of city codes.
"A part of me was scared when I heard, because I talked to him.
It's a little creepy," said Chris Yoder, 23, who once lived nearby.
Rader has yet to be charged, but a jubilant collection of law enforcers and community leaders told the crowd in City Council chambers they were confident the long running case could now be closed.
Rader was being held at an undisclosed location, and it was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer.
In Kansas, suspects generally appear before a judge for a status hearing within 48 hours of their arrest.
Prosecutor Nola Foulston said the death penalty would not apply to any crime committed before 1994, when the death penalty was introduced in Kansas.
The BTK slayings began in 1974 with the strangulations of Joseph Otero, 38, his wife, Julie, 34, and their two children.
The six victims that followed were all women, and most were strangled.
Along with his grisly crimes, the killer terrorized Wichita by sending rambling letters to the media, including one in which he named himself BTK for "Bind them, Torture them, Kill them."
In another he complained, "How many do I have to kill before I get my name in the paper or some national attention?"
But he stopped communicating in 1979 and remained silent for more than two decades before re establishing contact last March with a letter to a newspaper about an unsolved 1986 killing.
Since then, the killer had sent at least eight letters to the media or police, including three packages containing jewelry that police believed may have been taken from BTK's victims.
One letter contained the driver's license of victim Nancy Fox.
The new letters sent chills through Wichita but also rekindled hope that modern forensic science could find some clue that would finally lead police to the killer.
Thousands of tips poured in, and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation gathered thousands of DNA swabs in connection with the BTK investigation.
In the end, DNA evidence was the key to cracking the case, said Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.
"The way they made the link was some DNA evidence, that they had some DNA connection to the guy who they arrested," Sebelius said in an interview with The Associated Press.
She did not elaborate.
Authorities, who generally declined to answer questions in detail after announcing the arrest, had little to say about why BTK resurfaced after years without contact.
"It is possible something in his life has changed.
I think he felt the need to get his story out," said Richard LaMunyon, Wichita's police chief from 1963 to 1989.
He lived among them for nearly 30 years, having arrived in the community before graduating from college.
But Dennis Rader, the man police believe is the BTK serial killer, wasn't well liked by some of his neighbors.
Most residents who lived near Rader described him as a bureaucratic bully, an ordinance enforcement officer for this Wichita suburb who often went out of his way to find reasons to issue citations.
One neighbor said Rader was once seen measuring grass in a front yard with a tape measure to see if it was too long.
Another recalled catching Rader filming his house, documenting possible violations.
And yet, there were hints at a pleasant side.
He helped elderly neighbors with yard work, was active in his church and served as a Cub Scout leader.
Police say BTK the killer's self coined nickname stands for "Bind, Torture, Kill" may have killed as many as 10 people between 1974 and 1991.
Police arrested Rader on Friday and said Saturday they were confident he was the killer.
"He was definitely two sided," said Jim Reno, who lived across the street from Rader and his wife for 16 years and experienced several confrontations with him over what he called Rader's "harassment."
Rader, 59, moved into the neighborhood around 1976 and graduated from Wichita State University in 1979.
Although he studied criminal justice, Rader never became a police officer, instead going into code enforcement, or what Reno called "a glorified dog catcher."
Park City Mayor Emil Bergquist, citing a request of investigators, declined to comment about Rader's employment record or any part of the case.
Rader lived with his wife, whose parents lived around the corner.
No one answered the door at the residence Saturday afternoon.
Public records indicate he has two adult children.
Bill Lindsay, 38, lived behind Rader and said something about the man unnerved him.
Lindsay said his wife caught Rader in their adjoining backyards filming the back of their house.
"He really acted really funny," said Lindsay, a truck driver.
"I'd be on the road and my wife would tell me, 'Dennis has been out again, taking his pictures.'"
And yet most neighbors never suspected Rader of any connection to the serial killings.
"I didn't start thinking about (BTK) until I started seeing increased law enforcement in the neighborhood" in the last few weeks, Lindsay said.
Jason Day, 28, described the working class neighborhood 7 miles north of Wichita as "very quiet.
You'd never consider something like this happening here."
Day said his brother was in Rader's Cub Scout pack at the nearby Park City Baptist Church, but their mother pulled him out because of Rader.
"It was his demeanor," he said.
"He was so strange."
Rader also was a scout leader at Christ Lutheran Church, where he had held leadership positions for about 30 years.
Church members "are in a state of shock and bewilderment about the turn of events that have unfolded this week," said Michael Clark, the church's pastor.
Not everyone had a bad story about Rader.
David Cool said he had lived next to Raders' in laws for most of his life, and his parents knew Rader.
He said Rader helped his parents, now in their 70s, with yard work.
"Mom doesn't have a bad word to say about him," Cool said.
It took 31 years and countless clues delivered by the killer himself, but jubilant Wichita police Saturday named a Lutheran church leader and government inspector as the notorious BTK strangler, a poetry writing attention seeker who murdered at least 10 people and dared the authorities to catch him.
BTK for "bind, torture, kill" always said in his taunting messages that he wanted national attention and a catchy, tough guy nickname.
He became so audacious that he once called 911 to report a murder he himself had committed and strangled a neighbor who lived just six doors away.
Only today did police formally link her death to BTK, whom they identified as Dennis Rader, a married father of two grown children.
"The bottom line," Police Chief Norman Williams announced to whoops and cheers at a City Hall news conference, "BTK is arrested."
Rader, in custody awaiting formal charges, worked as a compliance officer in Park City, just north of Wichita, and attended Christ Lutheran Church for at least 25 years.
He is president of the church's governing council.
Pastor Michael Clark said the congregation is in a "state of shock and bewilderment."
He asked for Wichita's care and compassion.
"If you asked me to make a list of 500 names, his name wouldn't have been on it," one Christ Lutheran member said.
"A quarter evidently has two sides and no one, obviously, saw the other side."
Once Rader had been identified, details of his biography matched leads and suppositions developed by detectives through the years.
In the 1970s, he worked at a nearby Coleman camping gear plant where two of his victims were employed.
He graduated in 1979 from Wichita State University, where detectives 25 years ago found a photocopier used by BTK and where they speculated he studied a poem he mimicked in a later missive.
Wichita police have been embarrassed by mistaken arrests in the case twice before, but they are confident that Rader, 59, is their man.
Dozens of law officers and politicians attended the news conference, along with invited relatives of BTK's victims.
The first 46 minutes were defined by congratulations and bear hugs.
Boasts about the teamwork and technology that finally led to Rader were broad, but information remained scarce.
Lt. Ken Landwehr, a Wichita detective who has tracked BTK from the start, received two standing ovations before he spoke.
He then spent less than two minutes revealing what little information the authorities determined not to botch the prosecution want known.
Beyond the investigation, the search for the self named BTK has been a Wichita parlor game.
The fascination hit a new peak Friday with the arrest of Rader in a traffic stop.
Internet message boards created years ago to absorb the public buzz sizzled with theories and details, including an unconfirmed report that Rader's adult daughter put two and two together and alerted police.
In Rader's working class neighborhood, people wondered how a killer could have lived in their midst while some felt they just knew BTK must have been responsible for the killing of 53 year old Marine Hedge, a neighbor of Rader's on Independence Street.
"It's like putting together a puzzle," said Mary Dudley, county coroner and director of the Sedgwick County Regional Forensic Center.
"It's such a frustrating case, with getting communications ,taunting the police."
It was those communications that drove authorities to distraction in the 1970s but ultimately helped the case against Rader, police said.
BTK had a history of writing letters to police and news organizations, sometimes mailing them, other times leaving them in public library books.
"I can't stop it so the monster goes on and hurts me as well as society ,," he wrote after the early killings.
"It's a big complicated game my friend the monster play, putting victims number down, follow them, checking up on them, waiting in the dark, waiting, waiting," What united many of the killings, police said, was BTK's pattern of tying up his victims and strangling them, sometimes slowly.
He did not sexually assault them, police said, but left semen behind as evidence of his sexual pleasure.
The killer's determination to receive credit for his work was evident in the content and timing of his first missive, which followed the reputed confession under police questioning of a young Wichita man in the first four murders.
The October 1974 letter declared, "I did it by myself and no ones help."
But as the years passed, BTK went silent.
The case grew cold.
Investigators moved on.
Those who still thought about it wondered whether BTK had gone to prison, moved away, died.
Then, in March 2004, BTK mailed an envelope to the Wichita Eagle containing evidence of the previously unattributed 1986 killing of Vicki Wegerle, a young mother.
That letter was followed by another and another, some including jewelry and documents stolen from his victims.
The police revved up a task force, brimming with local police and state and federal agents.
In November, Chief Williams went to Washington and made a successful plea to the FBI for more help.
Forensics experts, using science not available in the 1970s, studied DNA swabs that Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius (D) said linked Rader to his victims.
By last month, the BTK communications had increased to include a decorated cereal box that contained jewelry and was left by a roadway.
Its presence was announced by a postcard ostensibly from one S. Killett.
The return address was the home of BTK's first victims.
"I think he wanted to tell his story.
He was providing enough information that that was eventually going to happen," said Richard LaMunyon, former Wichita police chief, who said BTK's writings mellowed over the years, becoming in tone "almost social."
"The interesting question is why," LaMunyon wondered aloud.
"What drove him to come forward at this time?"
LaMunyon had always assumed BTK lived in the area, although others speculated that he was a truck driver and occasional visitor.
As it happened, Rader raised his family in a humble Park City neighborhood around the corner from his in laws.
He did not venture far.
"He'd drive through here and wave to Mom and Dad," said Patty Loveday, 40, standing near a news media stakeout and police rope near Rader's house.
She remembers the horror and fear of the day Hedge was abducted.
Now she thinks of Rader's wife, who works at a local convenience store, "living with a person you don't know, for that long."
Across the street, Jason Day had nothing good to say about Rader, whom he considered something of a jerk, "like he was above the law."
He, too, was thinking of Rader's wife, "out of nowhere, finding out her husband's BTK.
You know this is going to rot inside her."
At the convenience store, her co workers were not talking.
One theme of the City Hall press conference was excitement that BTK may be behind bars forever, Kansas did not have a death penalty until 1994, after what police believe was his final killing.
Another theme was vindication, with Mayor Carlos Mayans recalling how often the police had been second guessed.
"We knew that our officers were doing the job," Mayans said, "and one day the nightmare would end."
A timeline from 1974 to present surrounding the BTK case: Jan 15, 1974: Joseph Otero, 38, and his wife, Julie, 34, are strangled in their home along with two of their children, Josephine, 11, and Joseph II, 9.
April 4, 1974: Kathryn Bright, 21, is stabbed to death in her home.
Police later conclude she was a BTK victim.
October 1974: The Wichita Eagle Beacon gets a letter from someone taking responsibility for the Otero family killing and including crime scene details.
March 17, 1977: Shirley Vian, 24, is found tied up and strangled at her home.
Dec 8, 1977: Nancy Fox, 25, is found tied up and strangled in her home.
The killer's voice is captured on tape when he calls a dispatcher to report the crime.
Jan 31, 1978: A poem referring to the Vian killing is sent to The Wichita Eagle Beacon.
Feb 10, 1978: A letter from BTK is sent to KAKE TV claiming responsibility for the deaths of Vian and Fox, as well as another unnamed victim.
Police Chief Richard LaMunyon announces a serial killer is at large and has threatened to strike again.
Aug 15, 1979: Police get more than 100 tips in the first day of radio and TV broadcasts that repeat the voice of the BTK strangler from the 1977 recording.
April 28, 1979: BTK waits inside a home, but leaves before the 63 year old woman who lives there returns.
He later sends her a letter letting her know he was there.
Sept 16, 1986: Vicki Wegerle, 28, is strangled in her home.
March 19, 2004: A letter arrives at The Wichita Eagle containing a photocopy of Wegerle's driver's license and photos of her body.
Police link it to BTK.
Feb 26, 2005: After receiving several more letters, authorities announce the arrest of BTK.
Dennis Rader, the churchgoing family man accused of leading a double life as the BTK serial killer, was charged Tuesday with 10 counts of first degree murder.
Rader made his first court appearance since his Friday arrest by videoconference from his cell at the Sedgwick County detention center.
During the brief hearing, Rader sat with his hands folded behind a small desk.
The BTK killer, whose nickname stands for "Bind, Torture, Kill," was suspected of eight deaths beginning in 1974, but authorities said Saturday they had linked two additional victims to the serial killer.
Rader's arrest has also prompted nearby law enforcement agencies through Kansas to reinvestigate any cold cases that bear similarities to the string of slayings.
In the end, the BTK serial killer's downfall may have been his own love of sending letters, poems and packages out to the world.
Michael G. Clark, the pastor of Dennis L. Rader, the man charged with 10 counts of murder in the strangulation deaths that terrorized a city, said Tuesday that one item in the killer's most recent mailing to a local television station was what helped finally crack the case: an ordinary computer disk.
The police here have refused to say what led them to arrest Rader, a city codes enforcer and a church leader, 31 years after the first killings in Wichita, but they have acknowledged that the BTK serial killer's peculiar and persistent communications with the public, particularly in recent months, worked to their advantage in the investigation.
Clark said that police told him they used information on the computer disk in BTK's final mailing, on Feb 16, to trace the disk back to a computer at Christ Lutheran Church, where Clark is the pastor.
Rader, the church council's president, had used the church's computer a few weeks earlier, Clark said, to print the agenda for a church council meeting he was to preside over.
Rader, 59, appeared before a judge for the first time on Tuesday, listening while 10 charges of first degree murder were read aloud via videoconference from the county jail.
When the killings began here in 1974, so did BTK's writings.
He sent them to television stations, left them in libraries, mailed them to the local newspaper.
Then, just as suddenly as the letters had begun, they stopped in 1979.
The silence lasted 25 years until March, when the first of 11 more packages and letters began arriving.
The last mailing arrived Feb 16 at a television station, and contained a lilac colored computer disk.
Experts said old files that seem to be erased might actually still be accessible on such a disk, or the disk might preserve an IP address particular to an individual computer that is linked to the Internet.
The man arrested on suspicion of being the BTK serial killer confessed on the day of his arrest to six slayings, a source close to the investigation said.
Investigators, who allege Dennis L. Rader committed a decades old string of 10 slayings, also are looking into whether he was responsible for another three killings including at least one that occurred after Kansas restored the death penalty in 1994, the source told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity on Sunday.
Rader made the confession Friday, the day of his arrest, according to the source.
"The guy is telling us about the murders," the source said.
When asked for comment, District Attorney Nola Foulston said, "Your information is patently false," but she refused to say whether Rader had made any confessions or whether investigators are looking into Rader's possible involvement in more unsolved killings.
Police spokeswoman Janet Johnson also declined to comment specifically on the accuracy of the source's statements.
Rader was being held on a $10 million (euro7.78 million) bond in the deaths of 10 people between 1974 and 1991.
Police had long linked the BTK killer to eight murders, but added two more on Saturday after Rader's arrest and said at the time their investigation was continuing.
Now, the source said, police are looking whether Rader was responsible for the deaths of two Wichita State University students, as well as a woman who lived down the street from another known victim of BTK, the killer's self coined nickname that stands for "Bind, Torture, Kill."
It was unclear when the three slayings occurred, but the source said one of them took place while Kansas' death penalty was in effect.
Prosecutors had said initially they could not pursue the death penalty against Rader because the 10 murders linked to BTK occurred before Kansas state law allowed capital punishment.
Rader, 59, could appear in court as early as Monday, when he would stand in front of a judge on video while prosecutors recite yet to be filed criminal charges against him.
The judge would also review Rader's bond and set a permanent amount.
The hearing could happen Monday but was more likely to be postponed until Tuesday, the district attorney's office said Sunday.
It was unclear whether Rader had a lawyer.
Police were confident Rader's arrest last week would bring to an end 30 years of fear about the BTK strangler.
But as they pored over news of a suspect's capture, many residents here were left with an unsettling feeling that he had been hidden among them all along.
Charlie Otero, whose parents and two siblings were BTK's first victims in 1974, said Sunday that he was "waiting with anticipation" to learn more about the DNA evidence that has been credited with helping crack the case.
Otero believes his family was targeted, although the rest of BTK's victims were likely chosen at random.
He isn't sure why the family was targeted but said it's interesting that Rader and his father served in the Air Force at the same time in the 1960s.
"I'm sure this will all come out during the trial," he said.
Rader, a married father of two, a Cub Scout leader and an active member of a Lutheran church, was anything but a recluse.
His job as a city code enforcement supervisor required daily contact with the public, and he even appeared on television in 2001 in his tan city uniform for a story on vicious dogs running loose in Park City.
Before becoming a muncipal employee, Rader worked for a home security company, where he held several positions that allowed him access to customers' homes, including a role as installation manager.
He worked for ADT Security Systems from 1974 to 1989 the same time as a majority of the BTK killings.
Mike Tavares, who worked with Rader at ADT, described him as a "by the books" employee who would often draw diagrams of houses and personally make sure technicians installed systems correctly.
While Rader was known as a blunt person and rubbed some people the wrong way, it never struck co workers as anything other than businesslike.
"I've spoken to some co workers who were around then, and everybody is very numb," said Tavares, who left the company in 2001.
At his church and around town, many expressed shock that Rader was accused of being the BTK killer.
"Disbelief, absolute disbelief," said a tearful Carole Nelson, a member of Christ Lutheran Church, where Rader was an usher and the president of the church council.
"I never would have guessed in a million years."
The church's pastor, Michael Clark, said Rader's wife, Paula, was in a state of shock when he visited the family, who remained in seclusion Sunday.
"Her demeanor and voice indicated she was suffering," Clark said.
Just days before his arrest, Rader brought spaghetti sauce and salad to a church supper, even though he was unable to attend himself, church member Paul Carlstedt said.
"The guy that walked in here was not the face of evil," said Bob Smyser, an usher at the church.
Still, a sense of relief was palpable around Wichita after the apparent capture of the killer who had sent taunting letters to the media since the 1970s.
"Hallelujah, praise the Lord," Gaylene Brown said over breakfast Sunday at Don's Restaurant, where Rader's face was a common sight.
Police disclosed little about how they identified Rader as a suspect and have said they will not comment further on the case, but bits and pieces of the investigation have filtered out.
Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius told The Associated Press that DNA evidence was the key to cracking the case.
It was unclear whether BTK's letters helped lead to the arrest.
Police have said they obtained semen from the crime scenes even though the killer did not sexually assault his victims.
Wichita television station KAKE, citing sources it did not name, reported that DNA from Rader's daughter, Kerri, was instrumental in his capture, though KAKE anchor Larry Hatteberg said it did not appear the daughter turned in her father.
Parts of the profile released earlier by police seemed to match up.
Investigators said they believed the killer was familiar with a professor at Wichita State University.
Rader graduated from the university in 1979.
In the 1970s, Rader worked at a nearby Coleman camping gear plant where two of his victims were employed.
Associated Press Writer David Twiddy contributed to this report from Wichita.
For those gathered inside Christ Lutheran Church on Sunday morning, the lasting images of Dennis L. Rader were simple, sweet moments.
Just last Wednesday evening, for instance, he stopped by the church to drop off spaghetti sauce and salad for a potluck dinner before he went to visit his mother at the hospital.
Even as Wichita voiced relief at the prospect that one of the most notorious serial killers in recent history might finally be behind bars, those who knew Rader, the man the police have accused of being the city's BTK killer, said they were beginning to experience new waves of bewilderment, confusion, betrayal and fear.
At Christ Lutheran, where Rader, his wife, his mother and his in laws have been members for 30 years and where Rader began his elected term as president of the church council in January, the pastor, Michael G. Clark, said he was having difficulty grasping the possibility that the man the police arrested on Friday was the same one he knew so well.
Some members of the congregation wept during services Sunday, and crisis counselors arrived at the church by the afternoon.
Rader's wife, Paula, was in seclusion, the pastor said, in "a state of disbelief."
"We've known him for 30 years, and there's nothing that would have suggested anything like this," Paul Carlstedt, one of the church's 400 members, said as he huddled in the chill with his wife outside Christ Lutheran.
"We just don't know what to think, don't know what can happen or go on with people."
During those same 30 years, as Rader was attending Christ Lutheran, raising two children, and working for a security system company, as an address checker for the Census Bureau and eventually as a code compliance officer in his suburban hometown of Park City, the police say he was also secretly tormenting Wichita.
They say he is responsible for strangulation killings, taunting and explicit letters, poems and packages to the police and media outlets.
BTK, as the killer had dubbed himself in one of his rambling writings years ago, stood for bind, torture, kill.
On Sunday, the authorities here said that Rader, 59, had been booked into Sedgwick County's jail, where he was being held on a $10 million probable cause bond on suspicion of 10 first degree murders, dating from 1974 until 1991.
Prosecutors here will probably file formal charges against him this week, Georgia Cole, a spokeswoman for the Sedgwick County district attorney's office, said on Sunday.
Rader, who has not been appointed a lawyer, will not face the death penalty, even if convicted in the 10 killings the authorities have him accused him of.
Each of the killings occurred before Kansas allowed prisoners to be executed.
Still, the authorities here say they have by no means ended their investigation.
On Saturday, when they announced Rader's arrest, it was the first time they had publicly linked two new killings to BTK.
And investigators will continue to examine other unsolved killings in the area over the last 31 years to determine if they can be linked to BTK.
Richard LaMunyon, the former police chief who led the department during the peak of the BTK search years ago, said that investigators had long thought that six to eight additional killings might also be BTK cases.
While the arrest, residents here said, may have answered some of their biggest questions about the killer they had been wondering and worrying about for more than a generation, it also set off a new set of questions, small and large.
In a weekend news conference, law enforcement officials revealed almost nothing about why they focused on Rader and what evidence they might have against him.
In the information void, rumors and questions filled Wichita's airwaves and Internet chat rooms on Sunday: How had the police found him now, after so many years of looking?
Why was Park City's public library suddenly shut down on Friday during Rader's arrest?
Who had supplied the DNA sample that, according to comments by Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, allowed the authorities to link Rader to the crime scenes?
Janet Johnson, a Wichita police spokeswoman, did dismiss one claim that had been reported on national television.
Rader's daughter, who is in her 20s, did not turn her father in to the police, as some news accounts contended, Johnson said.
In Park City, the small suburb just north of Wichita where Rader lived with his family for most of the past 30 years, the questions were more personal.
On Sunday, half a dozen police cars and a maze of yellow police tape lines still filled the neighborhood near Rader's house.
Donna Lowry, a neighbor, leaned against her porch wall, reflecting on all the times she had talked to Rader in his role as a city worker checking homes and yards for possible code violations a job, all here say, Rader carried out with no tolerance for even the most minor violations.
In his uniform, with his badge and his marked city vehicle and his cap with earflaps, Rader often pulled up to her house, Lowry said, to complain about the way her boat was parked in the front driveway or her German shepherd running loose.
Upon further reflection, she wondered, Had he looked at her strangely?
Why hadn't she always locked her front door?
Would her 15 year old son get over the stress he kept talking about this weekend when he learned that the man who had once helped him when he was bitten by a dog was accused of being BTK?
Back inside Christ Lutheran Church on Sunday morning, Clark, the pastor, asked his followers to bolster one another in a "time of craziness," and not to lose their faith.
"It is important that we show compassion and love towards our brother Dennis Rader.
If what is claimed to be true, we should be about the business of asking for God's help in healing of heart and soul," he told them during his sermon.
"The truth from God," Clark added, "will free us from the anger, the pain, the bitterness, the hardened heart, the release from being lost and confused."
Clark learned of Rader's arrest, he said, when four police officers appeared at the church's front doors on Friday.
They had a search warrant.
Clark would not reveal what the officers said they were looking for or whether it related to Rader's role as church council president, but he said that they told him they considered Rader a suspect in the BTK serial murders.
Clark is still trying to fully digest what they were telling him about the man who had sometimes run the sound system in the building, had served as an usher and who was in church just a week ago Sunday.
It took 20 years for Sue Swartzendruber to become truly frightened by the murder of her next door neighbor, Marine Hedge.
At the time of Hedges murder in 1985, Swartzendruber said police and family members believed her death may have been the result of a domestic dispute.
Rumors that the notorious Kansas serial killer known as "BTK" the initials for "bind, torture, kill" may have been responsible remained just that.
That is, until police announced the arrest last week of 59 year old Dennis Rader, a man who had been Swartzendruber's neighbor too.
Swartzendruber, 57, moved here several years after the first wave of gruesome killings by BTK terrorized this midwestern US town.
"I never felt threatened," Swartzendruber, a telephone company worker, told AFP over lunch at a Wichita restaurant.
"Not until 20 years later when I realized what could have happened if hed knocked on my door instead of hers."
There were no signs of a forced entry into Hedge's home.
The killer took her car and it was eight days before her naked body was found dumped on a dirt road.
"All these years I figured wed never find out what happened to her," Swartzendruber said.
In the days following Raders arrest, Swartzendruber has been remembering all those nights when she was alone in the house while her teenage children were visiting their grandparents.
Nights where she might have answered a friendly knock from thhought highly of the dog catcher rumored to take an active interest in sending stray dogs to be euthanized, she never imagined he could have been BTK.
"Its shocking as all is what it is," she said.
BTK first struck in January 1974, murdering four members of the Otero family, a married couple and their 11 year old daughter and nine year old son.
The children were strangled.
After police arrested a suspect, BTK began taunting the authorities, bragging in the first of a series of letters to them that he had acted alone.
The letter, full of spelling mistakes, was concealed in a book at a local Wichita library.
The killer called the local newspaper, the Wichita Eagle, to tell reporters where to find it.
BTK killed twice more in 1977.
It was years before he was linked to a seventh victim in 1986, although there has been rampant speculation for years amongst locals that he may have killed more.
Police have said the current tally of 10 victims may be increased during the course of the post arrest investigation.
During the height of BTKs killing spree, Rader worked at an ADT Security Services branch office in Wichita in positions that allowed him access to customers homes.
Prior to his arrest, Radar worked as a city ordinance enforcer in Park City.
A Cub Scout leader who was active in his local church, Rader is married with two children.
A 59 year old former home security company worker accused of being the notorious "BTK" serial killer was charged here on Tuesday with 10 counts of murder in connection with a case which baffled Kansas police for three decades.
Dennis Rader, 59, answered "yes, sir" when asked by district court Judge Gregory Waller if he understood the 10 charges of first degree murder against him.
Bail was put at 10 million dollars and his next court appearance set for March 15.
Balding, sporting a moustache and eye glasses and dressed in a bright red prison jumpsuit, Rader appeared before the judge from a detention cell by video link.
He was flanked by a public defender, Richard Ney.
It was Rader's first court appearance since he was arrested on Friday on suspicion of being the killer known by the initials BTK, which stand for "Bind, Torture, Kill" the grisly method employed by the murderer who terrorized the Wichita area for years.
Sedgwick County district attorney Nola Foulston offered few details about the case when speaking to reporters following Raders brief appearance.
"It is not our prerogative to try this case on the courthouse steps," she told reporters.
"These are allegations against an individual that must be proven in a court of this jurisdiction."
Foulston admonished the media for reporting false rumors about the case.
She declined to comment on reports Rader had confessed and insisted that no further information would be provided by her office until the March 15 preliminary hearing.
Authorities reopened their investigation in March 2004 after the killer, who had remained silent for decades, wrote to a local television station and sent a package containing the driver's license of a 25 year old woman killed in December 1977.
A Cub Scout leader, devout churchgoer and married father of two, Rader was a respected member of the local community before his arrest.
During the height of BTK's killing spree Rader worked at an ADT Security Services branch office in Wichita in positions that allowed him access to customer's homes.
Prior to his arrest, he worked as a city ordinance enforcer in Park City, a suburb of Wichita.
Rader is alleged to have murdered at least 10 people between 1974 and 1991.
Seven of the victims were killed between 1974 and 1977.
The BTK killer first struck in January 1974, murdering a married couple, Joseph and Julie Otero, their 11 year old daughter and nine year old son.
Both of the children were strangled.
After police arrested a suspect, BTK began taunting the authorities, bragging in the first of a series of letters that he had acted alone.
The letter, full of spelling mistakes, was concealed in a book at the local Wichita library.
The killer called the local newspaper, the Wichita Eagle, to tell reporters where to find it.
Besides the murders of the Otero family, Rader was charged on Tuesday with killing six women.
One of murders occurred in 1974, two in 1977 and one each in 1985, 1986 and 1991.
Rader will not be eligible for the death penalty because the murders occurred before this midwestern state reintroduced capital punishment in 1994.
Dennis L. Rader, the man accused of terrorizing a generation of residents here as the "BTK" serial killer, waived his right to a preliminary hearing on Tuesday, leaving this city waiting still longer to learn the carefully guarded details of an investigation that took more than 30 years.
The curious in Wichita who have seen glimpses of Rader in court once before in a prison jumpsuit and earlier, wearing his town code inspector uniform, in an old video clip from a news story got only a brief look at him during Tuesday's hearing as he politely told a judge that, "Yes, sir," he did want to waive the hearing.
In essence, it was his defense team's acknowledgment that the prosecution had enough evidence to go on to an arraignment next month and then a trial.
Rader, 60, is charged with 10 murders, the first of which occurred in 1974.
In the years that followed, the serial killer who dubbed himself BTK for his preferred method bind, torture, kill taunted the authorities here with grisly letters, clues, poems, photographs and phone calls.
After a sudden flurry of new communications starting last year, the Wichita police arrested Rader in February.
After the hearing on Tuesday, Nola Foulston, the district attorney, told reporters that she was disappointed that Rader had chosen to skip the preliminary hearing, which was to be the first time the prosecution would explain how the police had tied Rader to the killings.
Steve Osburn, one of Rader's lawyers, said that his client had opted against a preliminary hearing on the advice of his legal team.
Osburn said he expected that Rader would plead not guilty on May 3 during an arraignment here.In jail, Osburn said, Rader is meeting with someone from his legal team each day, is "being very cooperative" and is, given the circumstances, doing "OK."
In his crisp beige uniform, cap and badge, Dennis L. Rader took his job upholding the most mundane city laws with unusual earnestness.
He was often seen in his white truck, the words "Compliance Officer, Park City" painted on the side, puttering along at 10 miles an hour, searching for overgrown lawns, overflowing trash cans or dogs wandering past their fences.
"He looked for absolutely everything, and he must have enforced every rule there ever was just because he could, I guess," said Barbara Walters, 69, a retired auditor for the IRS, who challenged a $25 ticket that Rader had issued in August 1998, saying her dog, Shadow, was running loose.
Walters' lawyer said that Rader arrived for court more prepared than some lawyers do for murder trials, bearing a lengthy file on Shadow, a videotape of the dog and a complicated system of notebook tabs linking the accusations to his evidence.
Rader, and his pile of paper, won.
But police say the man who was a stickler for the slightest pet infraction in this modest suburb of Wichita had also killed 10 people by then.
Investigators say that Rader, who will turn 60 on Wednesday, probably in the solitary jail cell where he has been held since last week, is one of the nation's most notorious and elusive serial killers, the strangler who toyed with Wichita for three decades in letters and poems and packages and who long ago insisted that the public call him BTK, for his preferred method: bind, torture, kill.
Lawyers for Rader, who has yet to enter a plea in the case, did not return calls on Thursday or Friday.
Most stunning for the Wichita area, where Rader has spent his life, is not just that he was viewed as an ordinary fellow, someone who blended right in at the Taco Bell, but that he seemed to have stayed meticulously and constantly within the strictest mores of society more so, at times, than even many residents.
Rader and his wife of 34 years went to church each Sunday.
Sometimes when he left an after work bar outing to hurry home, his colleagues would privately breathe a sigh of relief, with him gone, they could drink up and tell off color jokes.
As far back as the eighth grade, Rader had been picked for the prestigious school patrol, the selected few who carried big red Stop signs and told classmates and motorists when to go and when not to.
"The thing to remember is that we always thought in the end that BTK would be a local, that he would probably even be a functioning member of the community," said Richard LaMunyon, who led the police department at the height of the investigation years ago.
"But I guess we never dreamed he would be functioning quite to this degree a church leader, a Boy Scout leader, someone quite so known, quite so public."
Many serial killers have led relatively successful lives, with steady jobs and relationships, in contrast to their popular image as loners and drifters.
But experts on serial killings say that the portrait of Rader takes that notion of stability, authority and prominence in the community to a level rarely seen.
Here, in a city where a generation of police officers spent their careers searching for BTK deconstructing his tangled, grisly writings, studying dozens of psychological profiles and swabbing DNA from the cheeks of 4000 residents some older detectives have now come to LaMunyon wondering whether they should have found Rader, who was hardly hiding away, decades sooner.
After all, LaMunyon said, Rader's name should have appeared on at least two broad lists of suspects in the 1970s, and he had other tenuous ties to three of the 10 victims.
Born on March 9, 1945, Dennis Lynn Rader was the eldest of four boys who grew up in a working class neighborhood in Wichita, a city of fewer than 170000 at the time.
His father, Bill, who died in 1996 after retiring as a plant operator at a Kansas utility company's generating station, was strict with but never cruel, Rader's childhood friends recalled.
"Raders are a little bit stubborn, but not mean," said Lee Rader, 73, a first cousin of Bill Rader who lives in Springfield, Mo.
Like much of the extended family in sturdy towns across the Midwest, Lee Rader said he could not remember a time when Bill Rader's family had done anything that might draw notice, much less cross the law.
"There is some divorces, I guess that's the worst thing that's going," he said.
Dennis Rader's young life seemed uncomplicated and happily ordinary to Roger Farthing, who grew up with him.
Rader buried himself in dime store novels and comic books.
He played games of cops and robbers until dark.
And he posed a question to the teacher on the first day of the first grade, a question few here let him forget: What time is lunch?
Years later, Rader reminisced on that simpler time.
In the "Riverview Round Up," a questionnaire for his grade school reunion, he listed his favorite memories in big block letters: recess, story times, last days of school, snowball fights broken up by the principal, art class, a nearby candy store, an old merry go round and, of course, lunch hour.
Asked in that questionnaire for any "pearls of wisdom," Rader wrote: "Do it now.
Life is complicated and short so stay young at heart as long as possible: It was so easy in '59."
After high school, Rader began attending Wichita State University but quickly joined the Air Force, learning to repair wire and antennae systems, and leaving Wichita for four years, the longest he would ever be away.
He returned in 1970, and settled down with Paula Dietz, who had grown up here, too, gone to the same high school, and lived just around the corner from the squat house in Park City, where they would soon have a boy, Brian, and a girl, Kerri.
Rader worked for a year on an assembly line at the Coleman Co., making heating and cooling units.
Still, he had no bachelor's degree, so he began studying again at Wichita State in 1973, working toward a degree that would take him six years to earn.
His major: criminal justice.
THE KILLINGS BEGIN On Jan 15, 1974, BTK struck Wichita for the first time, although most residents would not learn those initials or even that a serial killer was on the loose for several years.
The scene was ghastly, unlike anything this city had seen before.
Four members of the Otero family Joseph, 38, a retired Air Force officer, Julie, 34, who had worked at the Coleman Co. about a month before, and two of their children, Josephine, 11, and Joseph II, 9 were strangled inside their home in the middle of the day with the cord used in Venetian blinds.
Left behind was a uniquely grisly scene, the details of which would be echoed in the future killings over the years that followed.
The phone line had been cut.
The Oteros had been bound, and the police noted that the knots were particularly elaborate.
The killer had taken at least one souvenir of the day: a watch.
None of the Oteros had been sexually assaulted, though Josephine's body was found partly clothed, hanging from a sewer pipe in the basement.
Not far from the girl, there in the basement, semen was found, as it would be in subsequent killings.
Investigators quickly believed they were searching for a sexual deviant, someone who took pleasure in tying people up, watching them gasp for air and die slowly.
Some of the victims' faces were left bloated, investigators said, suggesting that the killer would strangle them, let them breathe, then strangle them some more.
The Otero case would be the first and last known time that BTK would kill a man or a child: The rest of the victims were all women, seemingly picked at random, with no firm connections between them, and in ages ranging from 21 to 62 years old.
Nine months later, after the police announced a possible confession in the Otero case, the killer's first letter appeared.
It took credit for the Otero deaths, mentioned details that the police said only the killer would have known, and expressed frustration that someone else might be trying to assume credit for the deaths.
The letter was riddled with typographical and spelling errors.
"I can't stop it so the monster goes on, and hurt me as well as society," the letter said.
He wrote on of his complicated "game" of following victims, checking up on them, and then "waiting in the dark, waiting, waiting."
The letter closed with a postscript: "The code words for me will be Bind them, toture them, kill them, B.TK, you see he at it again.
They will be on the next victim."
But by then the killer had already struck again.
Kathryn Bright, who also worked at Coleman, had been stabbed to death inside her house in April.
Her phone lines were snipped and she was bound with a knotted cord.
IN THE SECURITY BUSINESS Soon after Rader started a job at ADT, the security company, at the end of 1974, he was widely disliked particularly by those beneath him when he became a supervisor for the alarm installers.
"He was deeply competent, organized, and good at what he did, but he was a task master," said Rick Carr, 68, who sold systems for ADT.
"He came in with the attitude: You're here to get the job done and I'm not here to be someone's pal."
Rader worked for 14 years in what others called "the dungeon," the section of the office with no windows and gray walls.
But his job also sent him out of the office during the day, to sign off on installations.
At company swimming pool parties at the Carrs' Wichita home, Martha Carr, Rick Carr's ex wife, said Rader always arrived cheerily with his wife and children, looked you right in the eye and said all the right things: that the party was lovely, the food was nicely arranged.
Paula Rader, meanwhile, was a fabulous cook and a quiet, sweet woman, Martha Carr said.
"She seemed innocent not worldly, you know?"
One regular topic of discussion at ADT, not surprisingly, was BTK.
"It was the conversation all over town, but this was a security company, and let's face it BTK increased our business," said Denise Mattocks, 46, who worked alongside Rader for years and said she respected, liked and trusted him.
Whatever dislike there was of him, she said, stemmed from his exceptional standards and from his employees' tendency to cut corners on the job.
Mattocks, who was single, was particularly fearful of BTK, she said, and told Rader so regularly.
Like so many in Wichita as the panic grew, she spoke of checking her telephone for a dial tone every time she got home and of the shortage of deadbolt locks at hardware stores around town in those years.
Rader, she recalled, said little in response.
If anything, his efforts at conversation leaned more to his life at home: his wife, the tomatoes in his garden, his Boy Scout outings.
Rader became a Scout leader when his son, Brian, was about 8 and could join Pack 491.
Rader held the boys to strict standards, not letting them slide by, as some fathers did, without perfecting skills for a badge, said George J. Martin, 70, who helped lead the pack.
Rader was particularly capable, Martin said, when it came to the knots the boys had to learn.
"The sheep shank, the bowline, the half hitch, the monkey fist," he remembered, "Dennis knew them all.
He learned them when he was a Scout himself."
THE LETTERS STOP By the late 1970s, BTK had killed seven people, police say, and the eerie, taunting letters kept arriving.
One letter was traced to a copying machine at Wichita State University.
In 1979, after BTK apparently broke into a home and waited without success for its occupant to come home, he sent an explicit poem for the woman who never arrived: "Oh, Anna Why Didn't You Appear."
Apparently, the woman, 63 and a widow, had been his eighth target.
In part, the poem read: "Alone again I trod in pass memory of mirrors, and ponder why fornumber eight was not."
And then the letters suddenly stopped.
What did not stop, police say now, were the killings.
BTK killed more women in 1985, 1986 and 1991 including two cases that had not been linked to BTK publicly until last weekend.
Some people, like Al Thimmesch, a retired Wichita police officer, wonder whether still more deaths have yet to be identified as the work of BTK.
But if the police are right, the serial killings ended on Jan 19, 1991, with the death of Delores Davis, whose house is near Park City.
In May 1991, Rader was hired as Park City's compliance officer, a period one resident of this suburb calls the start of the "reign of terror" for homeowners here.
Rader's critics here say he seemed to sit in his truck, just waiting for something to go wrong.
He took numerous photos of their homes, they said, in search of something awry.
Some people even insist that he sometimes let their dogs out himself, then cited them.
Rhonda Reno said she watched one day as Rader wandered on the lawn of a neighbor who was ill.
Rader walked the grass with a yardstick, she said, measuring for any infraction.
"I never trusted him," said Jim Reno, her husband.
"There were two people I keep an eye on in this block, and one was him."
Still, others here liked Rader, and found his outsized enthusiasm for his inspection work charming.
He helped an elderly resident trap skunks, and helped his neighbor, a single woman, by mowing her lawn and fixing her leaky faucets, she said.
And even he could bend the rules, when he wanted.
Virginia Jackson, 53, recalled the day when her boxer got loose.
Rader, she said, chased down the dog in his truck and after a long struggle, managed to bring it home.
Jackson never got a ticket.
"He was very professional," she said.
"He was doing his job."
BREAKING HIS SILENCE Last January, The Wichita Eagle published an article about BTK, to mark the 30th anniversary of the Otero killings and the start of the panic.
By then, the case had been forgotten by many.
The youngest people here had never heard of the serial killer.
In the heart of the article, the suggestion was made that BTK might have moved away or even died.
Two months later, BTK wrote a letter, his first in a quarter century.
From there, he embarked on a frenzy of mailings 11 of them.
He filled these, too, with trinkets, some apparently from the killings: an identification card, photographs, a word puzzle, a doll with a plastic bag over its head, a necklace, a computer disk and a victim's driver's license.
By last weekend, with help from the computer disk and DNA evidence, the police announced that BTK had been arrested.
Looking back, some people wonder if the Wichita police could have made an arrest sooner.
LaMunyon, the former police chief, tells those who ask that he does not believe an arrest was possible over all those years, the BTK's newest mailings, many of which contained a mellower, more conciliatory tone than years before, created a whole new room full of evidence for investigators to go on.
Still, he acknowledged that Rader's name probably was included on two long lists drawn up by the police years ago.
The police had gathered the names of Coleman employees, at one point, since the first two women killed had worked there, as had, it turned out, Rader.
They had also collected the names of white men at Wichita State in the mid and late 1970s because they knew that one of BTK's letters had been copied on campus and that a poem sent by BTK was thought to resemble a song taught in a popular professor's folklore class at Wichita State.
There was another link, too.
Although the police had not publicly connected the death of Marine Hedge, the eighth victim, to BTK until last weekend, at the time of her death, Hedge lived six houses down the street from Rader's home in Park City.
"I think the police made a mistake over the years," said Robert Beattie, who is finishing a book about BTK.
"They were looking for a Charles Manson type."
Charles Liles, a former Wichita police officer, said the police focused too narrowly on convicted sex offenders rather than someone who might live right among them.
Michael G. Clark, Rader's pastor, visited him in jail on Wednesday.
Rader is "doing as well as can be expected," Clark said.
Clark's own disbelief, though, has not worn off.
The more he reflects, Clark said, the more he remembers only ordinary conversations with Rader.
"That's what I've realized," Clark said.
"There is nothing to remember, nothing that would make it all make sense."
Park City, meanwhile, fired Rader, saying only that he had missed work.
For about 15 years, it was the job of the man police have accused of being the BTK serial killer to help keep people safe.
Before he started as a city code enforcer in suburban Park City, Dennis L. Rader was an employee at an ADT Security Services branch office in Wichita, holding several positions that allowed him access to customers' homes.
He worked for the home security company between 1974 and 1988 the same time as a majority of the killings.
Police have not disclosed any evidence suggesting Rader worked at the homes of the BTK victims.
But his employment history has given police and Wichita area residents one more piece of the puzzle after being baffled for years about the killings.
Rader was scheduled to appear in court at noon on Tuesday via video so prosecutors could recite yet to be filed criminal charges against him and the judge could review bail.
It was unclear whether Rader had a lawyer.
Rader, 59, a churchgoing family man and Cub Scout leader, was arrested Friday.
He remains held in lieu of $10 million (euro7.58 million) bail in connection with 10 deaths, committed between 1974 and 1991.
The BTK killer re emerged in March 2004, taunting police with letters and packages sent to media outlets.
Authorities have declined to say what led them to zero in on Rader, a married father of two and an active member of a Lutheran church.
Police had long linked BTK the nickname comes from the killer's own writings to authorities and stands for "Bind, Torture, Kill" to eight murders, but they added two more on Saturday after Rader's arrest and said their investigation was continuing.
A source close to the investigation said he had confessed to six killings.
"The guy is telling us about the murders," the source said on condition of anonymity.
Meanwhile, investigators in two nearby counties said Monday that they were looking at old cases with similarities to BTK homicides.
Investigators remained tightlipped Monday about the investigation, going so far as to hold a news conference to warn that public speculation could complicate their investigation.
Police Chief Norman Williams vowed that Rader will "not be tried in the media, but rather in a court of law."
Williams reiterated Monday that police have linked Rader to the 10 slayings blamed on BTK.
But the source said investigators were looking into whether Rader was responsible for the deaths of two Wichita State University students as well as a woman who lived down the street from another known victim of BTK.
Upset at the details reported about the investigation, Williams said he would ask prosecutors if they can take legal action against members of the media.
But he did not go into specifics about what information was inaccurate, and he refused to take any questions.
In a written statement issued Monday, Boca Raton, Florida based ADT said it had little detailed information on Rader's employment record in Wichita, but pledged to cooperate with investigators.
Jason Watkins, part owner and general manager for Alarm America, another local company that sells security systems, said that while it's not required by law, many security alarm companies conduct routine criminal background checks on prospective employees.
But he noted that Rader has never apparently before been in trouble with the law.
Mike Tavares worked with Rader at ADT and described him as a "by the books" employee who would often draw diagrams of houses and personally make sure technicians installed systems correctly.
While Rader was known as a blunt person and rubbed some people the wrong way, he never struck co workers as anything other than businesslike.
In the year since BTK reappeared, the number of Wichita area residents installing ADT like security systems rose noticeably.
In some cases, the waiting periods for systems installations increased from two days to almost a week.
"There was a little bit of panic buying," said Bob Collins, who has been in the alarm industry for 25 years and is president of Comsec of Kansas.
"The psychological impact of his breaking silence after 30 years caused people to reassess their security."
Associated Press Writer Roxana Hegeman contributed to this report from Wichita.
The man accused of the BTK serial killings waived his right to a preliminary hearing Tuesday, an acknowledgment that the state has enough evidence to go to trial.
During the hearing, which lasted only a few minutes, Dennis Rader calmly answered "Yes, sir" to questions from Sedgwick County District Judge Gregory Waller about whether he wanted to waive the hearing and whether he understood his rights.
Prosecutors presented no evidence against Rader, who was neatly dressed in a gray suit and wearing leg restraints.
"Considering the low burden of proof, we didn't think there would be anything new that would come out anyway, so we didn't think there was much to be gained by having a preliminary hearing," said Rader's attorney, Steve Osburn.
After the brief hearing, District Attorney Nola Foulston told reporters: "Of course, there is a certain type of disappointment because it prolongs the agony for the public to know."
Rader, formerly a city ordinance enforcement officer for suburban Park City, was arrested Feb 25 and is charged with 10 counts of first degree murder.
Rader, 60, will enter a plea at his arraignment, set for May 3.
The BTK strangler, whose nickname stands for "Bind, Torture, Kill," had been suspected of eight torture deaths beginning in 1974, and since Rader's arrest authorities have linked two more victims to the serial killer.
Prosecutors can't seek the death penalty because the crimes were committed before 1994, when Kansas passed its capital punishment law.
Charlie Otero, whose parents, brother and sister were killed by the BTK strangler in 1974, said in a phone interview from his home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, that he was "extremely disappointed" that he would have to wait to hear the evidence in the case.
Otero, who had discovered his parents' bodies, also said he was anticipating testifying against Rader.
"I am looking forward to seeing him face to face," he said.
Rader will plead not guilty at his arraignment, Osburn said.
He also said he did not foresee Rader pleading innocent by reason of insanity and did not anticipate a plea bargain.
Defense attorneys have not decided whether to seek a change of venue for the trial.
In a preliminary hearing, prosecutors need only to prove that they have enough evidence to show probable cause that a crime was committed and that the defendant did it.
Also at the hearing, the judge granted a prosecutor's motion to add more witnesses, but that motion was kept under seal, as most court papers in the case have been.
Rader, who is being held on a $10 million bond, is no longer secluded from other prisoners, Osburn said.
He has been sheltered from much of the media coverage.
"All things considered, he is doing OK," he said.
Also Tuesday, Gov. Kathleen Sebelius proposed adding nearly $405000 (euro311634) to the state budget to cover costs associated with Rader's defense.
The money would allow the state Board of Indigents' Defense Services to hire another attorney, paralegal and investigator to help the three county public defenders handling Rader's case.
Also, the extra money would allow Rader's team to hire expert witnesses.

Mortgage giant Fannie Mae is now the target of a formal inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission over its accounting practices, the company said in a regulatory filing Tuesday.
The inquiry, which was previously an informal investigation, means that federal regulators may now subpoena documents from the company as well as require the testimony of company employees and executives.
In its filing with the SEC, the company said it would cooperate fully with the probe.
Formal investigations require a vote of approval from the SEC's commissioners.
Fannie Mae, which last week was ordered by the Justice Department to preserve documents as part of a criminal investigation, has been accused of manipulating its accounting practices in order to meet Wall Street earnings expectations.
Since word of the SEC's informal investigation broke Sept 22, the company has also been sued by a number of shareholders, claiming that the actions of company executives has harmed shareholder value.
Testifying before Congress earlier this month, chairman and chief executive Franklin Raines and chief financial officer Timothy Howard said Fannie Mae did nothing wrong in its accounting and insisted that the regulators' allegations represent an arguable interpretation of complex rules.
They specifically denied the allegation that, in an instance in 1998, accounting rules were deliberately violated so that top executives could collect full bonuses.
Washington based Fannie Mae is the second largest financial institution in the United States behind Citigroup Inc.
It and its smaller sibling Freddie Mac pump money into the home mortgage market by buying and guaranteeing repayment of billions of dollars of home loans each year from banks and other lenders, then bundling them into securities that are resold to investors.
Their stock and debt are widely held by investors worldwide.
Last year, Freddie Mac restated some $4.5 billion in earnings, ousted top executives and was fined a record $125 million in a settlement with federal regulators.
Its restatement of earnings, which mostly had been understated, prompted regulators to examine Fannie Mae's accounting.
Fannie Mae fell $1.04 to $67.76 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, and slumped another $1.97 to $65.79 in after hours trading.
Fannie Mae, accused by regulators of deliberately flouting accounting rules, said Monday that it could not meet a deadline for a quarterly financial report and may be required to record $9 billion of previously unreported losses if the Securities and Exchange Commission determines that its accounting was wrong.
Such a correction would erase nearly 38 percent of the mortgage funding company's reported income since Jan 1, 2001, when the key rule took effect.
The company faced a deadline late Monday to file a report with the SEC for the quarter ended Sept 30 but said it was unable to do so because its auditor could not complete the required review of its financial statements.
In a news release, Fannie said its income for the third quarter fell $251 million, or 9 percent, to $2.4 billion from the third quarter of last year.
Fannie Mae's accounting has been under investigation by the Justice Department and the SEC, and it has become the subject of investor lawsuits.
Regulators at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight reported in September that they found pervasive accounting violations at Fannie.
The company was driven by a desire to make its earnings growth appear consistent, OFHEO Director Armando Falcon Jr. testified before Congress last month.
In 1998, the company also improperly delayed booking $200 million of expenses, enabling top executives to receive their maximum bonuses instead of no bonuses, the agency alleged.
OFHEO accused Fannie of violating two accounting rules.
One, known as FAS 133, governs the treatment of complex financial instruments known as derivatives used to hedge against changes in interest rates.
Fannie said Monday that if its hedge accounting is invalidated, it could be required to retroactively report $13.5 billion of losses and $4.5 billion of gains, netting a $9 billion decrease in earnings since the beginning of 2001.
There would be a corresponding $9 billion decrease in Fannie's regulatory capital, the cushion it is required to maintain against a potential financial downturn.
As of June 30, the minimum was $31.2 billion and Fannie had $36.1 billion.
The company estimated the net cumulative loss if its accounting is wrong on the other rule, known as FAS 91, would be $26 million.
In addition to the problems regulators cited on that rule, Fannie said Monday that it found a mistake in some of its accounting related to FAS 91.
The net effect of correcting that mistake will be to increase earnings for 2001 and 2002 and decrease them for 2003.
The impact on 2003 will be insignificant and the overall effect of correcting the problem Fannie discovered will be a wash, Fannie said.
Fannie continues to assert that its accounting methods "are consistent with generally accepted accounting principles."
The company has long argued that FAS 133 produces a distorted picture of its earnings because the rule forces it to include unrealized gains and losses on its income statement.
Fannie said its outside auditor, KPMG LLP, concurred with the interpretations it presented in recent letters to the SEC defending its accounting.
But Fannie also hinted that it may take time for KMPG to sign off on its financial statements again.
The auditor's review "is subject to resolution of" the questions pending before the SEC and a separate review of OFHEO's findings being conducted by an outside law firm for Fannie's board of directors.
The SEC resolution could be months away, SEC spokesman John Nester said.
If Fannie is required to correct past financial statements, chief executive Franklin D. Raines and chief financial officer J. Timothy Howard could be required to give up past bonuses and stock gains linked to the improper accounting.
Chartered by the government to provide a steady flow of funds for home mortgages, Fannie Mae is one of the nation's largest and most complex financial institutions, with a stock market value of about $68 billion and debts of $956.6 billion.
Missing the filing deadline does not necessarily trigger any regulatory response.
The SEC evaluates such situations on a case by case basis, spokesman Nester said.
Fannie's smaller mortgage funding rival, Freddie Mac, announced in January 2003 that it expected it would need to correct accounting from prior years.
The company, which has hired an army of consultants to help upgrade its accounting systems and has spent more than $370 million on accounting and legal expenses, has not resumed issuing quarterly financial statements on a timely basis and says it does not plan to do so until next year.
Fannie released its statement after the market closed.
Its stock closed at $70.20, down 21 cents.
The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has ordered Fannie Mae, the nation's largest buyer of mortgages, to restate its earnings over the last four years after concluding that it had violated accounting rules on its treatment of derivatives and loans.
The agency's findings, announced Wednesday evening by Donald T. Nicolaisen, its chief accountant, is a huge setback for the company and its chairman and chief executive, Franklin D. Raines.
Fannie said last month that if it was found to be in violation of the rules, it might have to report after tax losses on its derivatives transactions of as much as $9 billion.
Fannie Mae, once the Federal National Mortgage Association before it became known by its nickname, was created by the federal government to promote home ownership.
It does so by buying mortgages from banks that issue them, allowing those banks to make further mortgages.
That huge secondary market helps keep interest rates low.
Fannie Mae, now privately owned, has become a giant in the process, with about $1 trillion in assets, and in the same league as Citigroup.
Chuck Greener, the company's top spokesman, said the commission's decision "will have a negative impact on our minimum capital position" but declined to quantify it.
"We are committed to taking the steps necessary to comply with our minimum capital requirement," Greener said.
He said that the company would also abide by the decision of the chief accountant.
Analysts have said that Fannie Mae could shore up its capital by selling some of its mortgage portfolio or by a securities offering.
Nicolaisen said that the SEC investigation of Fannie Mae was continuing.
The Justice Department is also looking at the company's accounting.
For Raines and his top advisers, however, Wednesday's announcement could be ominous news.
Throughout the crisis at the company, Raines, a former budget director in the Clinton administration, has continued to enjoy the strong support of the company's board, which had retained its own lawyers who also had not found any wrongdoing by Raines or the senior management at the company.
But the board's confidence in Raines may now begin to erode with the findings of the commission, and particularly if it faces a significant restatement of earnings.
Rep Michael G. Oxley, the Ohio Republican who heads the House Financial Services Committee, said on Wednesday that he would hold hearings on Fannie Mae after Congress returns next month.
At an Oct 6 hearing, Raines appeared confident that the company would be vindicated by the SEC and that it had been the victim of overzealous regulators at a different agency, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight.
That agency, known as OFHEO, had concluded in a report a few weeks earlier that Fannie Mae deliberately violated accounting rules and engaged in "cookie jar" accounting, dipping into reserves or postponing the recognition of expenses.
The company did this, OFHEO contended, to smooth out quarterly earnings, meet financial projections and in 1998, at least, earn larger bonuses for its top executives.
But Raines repeatedly assured skeptical lawmakers at the hearing that Fannie Mae had complied with the accounting rules and that it would be exonerated.
Nicolaisen's statement did not address many allegations raised by OFHEO, like irregular accounting or manipulation of expenses and earnings to earn larger management bonuses.
But he concluded that Fannie Mae had violated two accounting rules: one on accounting for the costs of prepayment of loans and another on the accounting treatment of derivatives that the company has used to reduce risks to its portfolio from changes in interest rates.
"Our review indicates that during the period under our review, from 2001 to mid 2004, Fannie Mae's accounting practices did not comply in material respects with the accounting requirements" of the two rules, Nicolaisen said in his statement.
At the heart of the dispute between Fannie Mae and its regulators is a complex accounting rule, known as SFAS 133, a statement of the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
That rule requires companies to account for derivative securities at market value but allows them to keep those changes from affecting earnings if the derivatives are used to hedge specified exposures.
The report by OFHEO concluded that Fannie Mae rode roughshod over the rules, certifying that some hedges were "perfect hedges" when they were not, and in other cases treated as hedges investments that did not qualify for the treatment.
In some cases, Fannie Mae's documentation of hedges was not adequate, and in other cases the documents were created retroactively, the report said.
The statement by the chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission did not go into the same amount of detail as the report by the housing regulator.
But the statement appeared to support its conclusions when it noted that "among other things, Fannie Mae's methodology of assessing, measuring and documenting hedge ineffectiveness was inadequate and was not supported."
In response to the findings of OFHEO, the company's board decided in September to increase its capital and change the way it accounts for deferring some expenses and hedging transactions.
Fannie Mae, the housing finance giant, for years has fended off critics who contend that the company is too big, too powerful and too risky.
But the Securities and Exchange Commission's Wednesday ruling, that Fannie Mae had seriously breached accounting rules, could touch off a chain reaction that results in stricter government controls, legislation limiting its growth, and possibly even a change in top management.
Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike on Thursday demanded that senior executives, including the chief executive, Franklin D. Raines, return tens of millions of dollars in bonuses and other compensation that they had earned based on inaccurate financial statements that the company issued from 2001 until this year.
Fannie Mae's board also met on Thursday to be briefed on the SEC's order that it restate earnings and declare losses of as much as $9 billion as a result of the accounting violations.
On Capitol Hill, lawmakers vowed to swiftly overhaul the oversight of the federally chartered company.
The board members concluded their unscheduled meeting early Thursday evening without deciding whether to keep or remove Raines after the announcement by the SEC's top accountant that the company had violated two rules.
That decision will now force the company to restate its earnings and take steps to significantly raise its capital level.
Three board members, joined by Raines and other regulators, had attended a briefing at the commission by its chief accountant on Wednesday shortly before he announced his decision, people at the meeting said.
But people involved in the inquiry said that board members know that they cannot let the uncertainty hanging over Raines linger, both for the sake of the company and the markets, and predicted that a decision would be made soon.
Fannie Mae, which for years has been one of the most formidable political forces in Washington, maintained a low public profile.
The company declined to comment further about the findings of the SEC staff or the remarks of lawmakers.
Nor did it issue any statement in support of its senior management.
In response to the findings of the commission, Democrats and Republicans called on Raines and other executives to return their bonuses.
Over the last three years, Raines has made $14 million in salary and bonus and has taken home $25.6 million in incentive pay.
As of the end of last year, he held options on 1.9 million shares of Fannie Mae stock, valued at almost $12 million.
Fannie Mae also paid almost $200000 for Raines' use of company transportation in 2003.
Timothy Howard, the company's chief financial officer, made $4.3 million in salary and bonus over the last three years and received $7.4 million in incentive pay.
At the end of last year, Howard held options on 607699 shares with a value of $11.5 million.
Fannie Mae's stock has fallen a bit since the end of 2003 when it was $75.06.
Thursday the shares closed at $69.30, down $1.39.
It is impossible to determine how many of the executives' options are exercisable at current prices.
Securities lawyers said that it was murky whether a little used provision of the landmark corporate law that Congress adopted after the scandals at Enron and other companies could force Raines and Howard to forfeit the bonuses and incentive pay they had received.
The provision, Section 304 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, only appears to apply to Fannie Mae starting in 2003, when it first filed stock registration documents with the commission.
The company, which as a congressionally created organization enjoys benefits that other public companies do not have, including an implicit financial guarantee from the Treasury and an exemption from state and local taxes, is exempt from federal securities laws.
It reached an agreement two years ago with the SEC to voluntarily comply with securities rules beginning in 2003.
Section 304, which has proven troublesome to apply because of its vagueness, also requires a finding of "misconduct," which the commission has not made.
That could change in coming months.
Lawyers involved in the Fannie Mae investigation underway at the commission and at the Justice Department said that, now that the commission's chief accountant has ruled, the SEC will focus more sharply on the reasons for the violations and the conduct of top executives.
Raines and other company officials have acknowledged that they approved of the accounting treatment of derivatives and loan prepayments that were the subject of the chief accountant's report.
But they have also challenged the conclusions of another agency, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or OFHEO.
That agency precipitated the crisis at Fannie Mae when it found three months ago that Fannie Mae violated accounting rules as part of an effort to manipulate earnings and in at least one year, 1998, meet profit targets that would trigger larger bonuses for executives.
Although lawmakers stopped short of seeking the ouster of Raines and his top aides, some predicted their departure would likely be forced by the company's board.
"I think the board is well out front and ahead on that issue," said Rep Richard H. Baker, R La., who heads a subcommittee overseeing Fannie Mae.
He said that as a result of the findings of the commission and OFHEO, "I think we'll have legislation on the president's desk by summer time."
Baker also sent a letter to the SEC asking it to examine $200 million in deferred expenses in 1998 and whether, as OFHEO concluded, it was done to meet earnings projections that allowed executives to win their maximum bonuses under an employee incentive program.
Even some of the company's strongest supporters appeared to be shaken in their confidence of its management as a result of the findings.
"To the extent that any executive compensation was enhanced as a result of inaccurate accounting, which led to the achievement of particular earnings targets, it must be repaid to the corporation," said Rep Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the senior Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee and one of the company's most vocal allies on Capitol Hill.
"This didn't happen by accident.
This is defective corporate governance."
In the Senate, meanwhile, Sen Chuck Hagel, R Neb., said he would reintroduce legislation that was not adopted this year but that would strengthen the government's oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The two companies, created by Congress, play a major role in the economy by buying mortgages from banks and then either holding them or selling them to investors as securities.
Fannie Mae's regulators would take steps to oust top executives, including chairman and chief executive Franklin Raines and Chief Financial Officer J. Timothy Howard, if the board of the government chartered mortgage funding company doesn't remove them on its own, according to a source close to the situation.
With Fannie Mae preparing to make accounting corrections that could negate $9 billion of its profit since 2001, board members convened by telephone Thursday for more than an hour, but no actions were taken, said sources who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the ongoing deliberations.
The board planned to meet again as early as this weekend.
Company spokeswoman Janice Daue declined to comment.
Raines' long standing and energetic defense of Fannie's accounting practices crumbled Wednesday night when, at the behest of the top accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company agreed to correct past financial reports.
At an October congressional hearing on the company's accounting, Raines said the buck would stop with him if Fannie was found in error.
"I've always tried my best to ensure that our company does the right thing in the right way," Raines told lawmakers.
"If, however, after a thorough review of all the facts, it is determined that our company made significant mistakes, our board and our shareholders will hold me accountable.
And I'll hold myself accountable."
Fannie's primary regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, had expressed doubts about the company's management in September, when it issued a report alleging that Fannie had ignored accounting rules it didn't like and manipulated estimates to achieve desired financial results.
OFHEO last year forced the ouster of top executives at Fannie's direct competitor, Freddie Mac, amid similar accounting problems.
Thursday, OFHEO spokeswoman Corinne Russell said the agency was working with Fannie Mae to address the impact the SEC directed correction would have on the company's financial position "and on other areas within our responsibility."
The correction could require Fannie to record $9 billion of losses from financial contracts known as derivatives the net of $13.5 billion of losses and $4.5 billion of gains that the company had excluded from past earnings.
That would leave Fannie with less than the minimum level of capital it must hold in reserve as a cushion against financial setbacks.
Because the SEC backed OFHEO's key findings on Fannie's accounting, the Justice Department will continue its ongoing investigation into whether top Fannie Mae executives manipulated earnings to trigger multimillion dollar bonuses for themselves, a source said.
Former senator Warren Rudman, a Republican from New Hampshire who is leading an investigation of the regulators' allegations for Fannie's board, said in an interview that that review is "progressing with a lot of intensity and a lot of resources."
The company remains under investigation by the SEC, the Justice Department and OFHEO, which is examining additional accounting issues.
Fannie's stock fell $1.39 Thursday, to $69.30.
In the bond market, news of the planned accounting correction had "a noticeable but minimal effect" on Fannie Mae's borrowing costs, increasing them slightly compared with those of Freddie Mac, said Walter Schmidt, who manages mortgage strategy and research at FTN Financial Capital Markets in Chicago.
Over the long run, Fannie's need to shore up its capital could put upward pressure on mortgage rates, but "by how much it's very difficult to say," Schmidt said.
Fannie borrows money by issuing bonds and uses those funds to buy mortgages from lenders, thereby giving them cash to make more loans.
The accounting correction could lead Fannie to sell off a chunk of the more than $900 billion of mortgages and mortgage backed securities it holds, said Jay Brinkman, vice president for research and economics at the Mortgage Bankers Association.
While the company kept its silence Thursday, some corporate governance specialists called for Raines's removal.
"I wouldn't invest in a company that Mr Raines was running," said Gregory Taxin, chief executive of Glass, Lewis & Co., which advises institutional shareholders.
"I think it's yet another shocking example of a company that professed publicly to have their house in order and yet had a substantial mess behind the scenes."
"I feel a little bit like the curtain was pulled in the Wizard of Oz and we see the small man behind the big image," said Sarah Teslik, a longtime advocate for institutional investors who has battled Raines over shareholder rights.
"If this isn't enough for Frank Raines to offer his resignation ,what is?"
Nell Minow of the Corporate Library, which rates corporations on the quality of their governance, called for the replacement of Fannie's audit committee, which is headed by Thomas Gerrity, a professor of management and former dean at the Wharton School.
But Minow said the publicly available information did not support the immediate firing of Raines and Howard.
Raines' initial response to the OFHEO report might have provided "a short term respite" for Fannie but now "raises further serious concerns about the credibility of his leadership," said Thomas Linsmeier, chairman of the department of accounting and information systems at Michigan State University.
"For them to be so far off on something like this is really in the current environment kind of shocking," said Patrick McGurn, executive vice president of Institutional Shareholder Services.

Breaking his public silence since a federal regulator issued a scathing report last month, Franklin D. Raines, the chairman and chief executive of Fannie Mae, is expected to tell lawmakers on Wednesday that his company properly applied accounting principles and never took steps to manipulate earnings or shade financial statements to enable top executives to receive large bonuses.
Raines and the company's chief financial officer, J. Timothy Howard, are expected to face tough questions from the House subcommittee that has been considering legislation to tighten the regulation of the company.
An advance text of his statement was provided to the committee, and in it Raines takes issue with the main conclusions of the report by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which said that Fannie Mae misapplied accounting rules to manipulate earnings and maximize executive bonuses.
"This is a serious allegation, and we strongly disagree with it," Raines said in his statement.
"In fact, when I certify our financial statements, I certify that these documents 'fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows,' of the company," he said.
"We engage in a rigorous due diligence process before I ever put a pen to paper and make that certification."
He said the company's application of one standard to account for hedge fund transactions was "careful, considered and thorough," and had been subjected to three years of review before it was put in place in 2001.
Raines also suggested that the company would try to persuade the Securities and Exchange Commission that the conclusions of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight were wrong.
"The SEC will ultimately decide whether our policy was, or was not consistent with" generally accepted accounting principles, he said.
Howard, who was singled out for criticism by the oversight office, will offer a similar defense, according to a text of his prepared testimony.
"All of my judgments regarding accounting issues were made in openness and good faith, with the goal of providing investors with the most meaningful and understandable information possible," Howard says in the testimony.
"When accounting issues arose I worked with the head of my accounting policy group, who I know to be knowledgeable and highly respected in the industry.
I also made certain that any accounting approaches we adopted were reviewed with our outside auditor."
Mortgage giant Fannie Mae, gripped by an accounting scandal and under investigation by the Justice Department, disclosed Tuesday that prosecutors had asked the company to preserve documents as part of the criminal probe.
In a regulatory filing, the government sponsored company also reported that it has been informed of eight lawsuits on behalf of shareholders that are being prepared or have been filed against it, chairman and chief executive Franklin Raines and chief financial officer Timothy Howard.
Several such suits have been announced since since Sept 22, when accounting questions at the company came to light amid news of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into accounting at Fannie Mae, which finances one of every five home loans in the United States.
Fannie Mae said in its filing with the SEC that the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, which is pursuing the criminal investigation, had asked it to preserve certain documents including papers related to a report by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight which alleged earnings manipulation to meet Wall Street expectations and accounting improprieties by the company.
Raines and Howard, testifying at a House hearing last week, insisted that Fannie Mae did nothing wrong in its accounting and insisted that the regulators' allegations represent an arguable interpretation of complex rules.
They specifically denied the allegation that, in an instance in 1998, accounting rules were deliberately violated so that top executives collect full bonuses.
Washington based Fannie Mae is the second largest financial institution in the United States behind Citigroup Inc.
It and its smaller sibling Freddie Mac pump money into the home mortgage market by buying and guaranteeing repayment of billions of dollars of home loans each year from banks and other lenders, then bundling them into securities that are resold to investors.
Their stock and debt are widely held by investors worldwide.
Last year, Freddie Mac restated some $4.5 billion (euro3.65 billion) in earnings, ousted top executives and was fined a record $125 million (euro101.5 million) in a settlement with the federal regulators.
Its restatement of earnings, which mostly had been understated, prompted the regulators to examine Fannie Mae's accounting.

From a compulsively neat desk inside a company that routinely jousts with powerful critics from the White House, Congress, the Federal Reserve and Wall Street, J. Timothy Howard has been the financial architect of one of the world's most formidable and most elegantly designed corporate money machines.
He also holds a corporate title that in recent years has emerged as one of the most treacherous in American business: chief financial officer.
The winds of scandal that uprooted Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and other companies often blew hardest through CFO suites.
Now, with controversy engulfing his employer the mortgage giant Fannie Mae Howard finds himself in legal and regulatory cross hairs that threaten to upend his career, throw the company's operations into turmoil and escalate a long running battle between Fannie Mae and its enemies.
Eleven days ago, a federal regulator issued a scathing report that accused the company, and Howard in particular, of accounting and managerial lapses that presented a false public portrait of its financial well being and enriched its executives.
Then, late last week, amid a mounting tempest of congressional criticism, Fannie Mae became the subject of a criminal investigation by the Justice Department, that investigation is likely to take precedence over a continuing Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry.
The stakes in all of this are large.
Fannie Mae provides much of the glue that helps hold the American mortgage market together, and if the company encounters serious setbacks, the impact on homeowners and the world's financial markets could be unpleasant.
Nor are the accusations of improprieties necessarily unique to Fannie Mae.
Wall Street analysts say that if the same regulatory magnifying glass were used to examine the operations of most other sizable mortgage concerns in America, a case for dubious accounting could probably be made for many of them.
Unlike the problems in recent financial scandals, issues raised by Fannie Mae's regulators appear largely to pertain to unwieldy accounting rules that are open to widely divergent interpretations not to sham transactions designed to cloak corporate malfeasance.
More serious accounting problems may yet emerge, and the company has already been forced to consider outsized financial restatements as a result of the regulatory inquiry.
And as the Justice Department investigation of Fannie Mae continues, other problems may surface.
Few longtime observers of Fannie Mae and of Howard expect that crimes will be found.
"The guy is as honest as the day is long, and the targeting of Tim Howard is an unfortunate byproduct of larger events," said Martin D. Eakes, chief executive of the Self Help Credit Union, a lender to low income borrowers based in Durham, N.C., who has alternately worked closely with and battled Fannie Mae on various mortgage issues.
"This will never, ever be like Enron.
Mark my words."
Maybe so.
But the confrontation between Fannie Mae and its critics already amounts to a clash of titans, both in Washington and New York, where Fannie Mae's lobbyists and its executives are accustomed to striding unencumbered through the halls of Congress, the financial byways of Wall Street and the finest dining rooms and clubs.
For at least the last decade, the company has been criticized in Congress and by Washington research groups.
Detractors accuse it of benefiting unfairly from its status as a quasi public enterprise, of not truly meeting its mission of providing affordable housing and of being too loosely regulated.
More recently, Fannie Mae's explosive growth has drawn the attention of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who raised concerns earlier this year that a collapse or trouble for the company posed threats to the economy.
Greenspan advocated the complete privatization of the company, a view that has been pressed elsewhere in Washington as well.
"It's a resistance to Fannie in Washington that is one part mortgage industry civil war, one part conservative ideological crusade to try to rein them in or force them to privatize," said Charles A. Gabriel Jr., senior Washington analyst at Prudential Securities.
"Having faced down the mortgage industry civil war and the ideologues, what finally tripped them up is they ran afoul of the shifting zeitgeist on accounting."
Amid all of this, Howard and Fannie Mae's chief executive, Franklin D. Raines, have left a long trail of embittered opponents who have complained about high handedness.
"They are a study of power in Washington," said Andrew M. Cuomo, who sparred with Fannie Mae on housing issues as a former secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
"Once the myth of invincibility is gone, the act crumbles."
Although Fannie Mae and its executives have not been shy in the past about taking on their critics, neither Howard nor Raines has been available for interviews about the regulatory review and investigations of the company.
Both men are scheduled to testify on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee, and they will be thrust into the uncomfortable and unusual position of having to defend themselves and their actions.
"This has become a big time game," said Bert Ely, a banking analyst in Alexandria, Va., and a longtime Fannie Mae critic.
"It is one of the big power struggles under way right now.
One of things that makes it that way is all the tumult and disturbing news, and issues that will not be resolved for months."
Fannie Mae is a behemoth in the mortgage business.
It can borrow money more cheaply than its competitors in the mortgage business because investors, and lenders believe that there is an implicit guarantee that the government will offer financial support to Fannie Mae if the company ever swooned.
And the company's vast operations have helped keep mortgage rates low.
Rather than lending money to prospective homeowners, Fannie Mae buys mortgages from banks that issue them, allowing lenders to make further mortgages.
Fannie Mae's size, and its government backing, also allow home buyers in the United States to have mortgages with rates that are guaranteed for as long as 30 years, a financial benefit that is unavailable in most other countries, where banks typically recalculate mortgage rates monthly.
Raines has been Fannie Mae's chief executive and corporate ambassador since 1999.
But Howard has a far longer tenure at the company and has overseen much of the machinery that has caused Fannie Mae's coffers to swell.
As chief financial officer since 1990, Howard has worked alongside three chief executives and three chief operating officers.
During that time, Fannie Mae rebounded from a spate of financial turmoil to post earnings of $7.9 billion last year a 71 percent leap from $4.6 billion in 2002.
Its loan losses have plunged over the last decade, and its mortgage portfolio has expanded to about $900 billion last year from about $200 billion in 1993.
The financial fortress that Fannie Mae has become is largely the handiwork of Howard and a highly skilled team of deputies who surround him.
As CFO, Howard introduced new methods of managing the company's debt and overseeing its funds, including deploying high octane financial tools known as derivatives that companies of every stripe use to insulate their operations from risks and unforeseen economic shocks.
Howard's financial wizardry has won many admirers on Wall Street.
"In my experience, I would put him in the higher ranks of CFOs at financial companies," said Frederick N. Khedouri, a senior managing director at Bear Stearns, an investment bank that has extensive dealings with Fannie Mae.
"Senior executives who know what the risks are and how to manage the risks are extraordinarily valuable and rare.
Someone should think long and hard about who you would get who would be better at this than Tim."
For all of Howard's intellectual abilities, his diplomatic skills are described as lacking by current and former colleagues, financial analysts, congressional aides and members of federal agencies that have worked with Fannie Mae.
In that regard, he may be a mirror of Fannie Mae itself a well oiled, highly calibrated machine that has also attracted an unusual amount of enmity for being high handed in its dealings with outsiders.
When he joined Fannie Mae as chief economist in 1982, Howard was among a cadre of new hires brought in by David O. Maxwell, then the chief executive.
High, volatile interest rates had brutalized the company and brought it to its knees.
The national housing market was in a crisis, and there was a sense of public mission among the new hires that through the shrewd use of sophisticated financial tools and strategic thinking they would be able to resurrect the housing finance market.
That missionary zeal still pervades Fannie Mae.
Financial analysts say the company's executives regard themselves as stewards of the housing market who have to fend off critics who might otherwise disrupt its sensitive operations.
In 1987, Howard was promoted from chief economist to head of asset management, a position that allowed him to oversee the most profitable and complex area of Fannie Mae's business, its enormous mortgage portfolio.
That job, said a former Fannie Mae employee, gave him "the keys to the kingdom."
Despite his monklike work habits, Howard is described by acquaintances as a family man, a devoted father heavily involved in his children's activities.
He owns an expensive home in the affluent Washington suburb of McLean, Va., where he hones his tennis game on his private court.
He is also a patron of the arts and has been an active supporter of the Washington National Opera, where he serves as vice president and treasurer.
Within Fannie Mae, however, Howard has drawn a number of detractors.
He is regarded as aloof, according to several people who have interacted with him at the company.
They describe him as a sometimes unrelenting perfectionist, and someone who is unremitting in his oversight of his employees and their work occasionally, in his early years as CFO, dressing down employees in front of their peers.
But others at the company say that he has grown into his job and that his management style softened, especially after he became vice chairman of Fannie Mae's board last year.
"I worked with Tim for a number of years and know him to be a person of extraordinarily high integrity," said John Buckley, a former senior vice president at Fannie Mae.
Howard's assumption of his vice chairman's title last year brought him to the peak of his powers inside Fannie Mae.
He became a member of a four member office of the chairman, a role that gives him a voice in corporate strategy including the setting of Fannie Mae's earning goals.
He has also grown close to Raines, and their second floor offices are connected by a small conference room.
By late last year, Howard had assembled an impressive portfolio of duties at Fannie Mae, essentially having responsibility for overseeing how the company makes its money, how it counts its money and how it audits that count.
When a little known and underfinanced regulatory agency assigned to monitor Fannie Mae's operations came calling earlier this year with pointed questions about how things were being run, Howard was asked to describe his wide ranging duties.
"Boy, how much time do we have?"
Howard answered with a laugh, according to a recent report prepared by the regulatory agency, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, known as Ofheo.
In Washington's pecking order, Ofheo is low on the list, with a small staff and few resources.
To critics, the fact that Fannie Mae is not overseen by a larger, more lushly funded regulator is a dangerous problem.
"We've always maintained from the very beginning that there are important regulatory and safety and soundness issues there," said Beneva Schulte, a spokeswoman at FM Policy Focus, a Washington group that is funded by financial services companies and other groups and tracks Fannie Mae's operations.
"There's no way they could keep meeting their earnings targets without going outside their charter into new lines of business or by being undercapitalized."
Ofheo's director, Armando Falcon Jr., began asking serious questions about Fannie Mae's accounting practices after critics said his agency failed to uncover accounting problems at Fannie Mae's sister agency, Freddie Mac.
According to members of federal agencies and others who have interacted with Fannie Mae and Ofheo, Falcon bridled at Howard's and Raines' reluctance to provide his agency with timely, detailed and respectful replies to queries since he became Ofheo's director in 1999.
According to former Fannie Mae employees, Howard consolidated his power by guarding information and by rarely delegating authority.
He adopted the same posture toward Ofheo, according to an individual close to Falcon.
The friction among Howard, Raines and Falcon became personal, said some who have witnessed their interactions.
It was as if "Frank and Tim had questioned Armando's manhood," said a financier who knows all three men.
An Ofheo spokeswoman acknowledged that there were problems between Fannie Mae and Ofheo but said her agency had maintained "an appropriate arm's length relationship" with Fannie Mae.
Whatever the backdrop, the report on Fannie Mae released by Falcon's agency on Sept 22 was caustic.
In strong language unusual in a regulatory report, it cited numerous examples of accounting irregularities and managerial conflicts that Ofheo examiners contended were used to doctor Fannie's earnings and inflate executive compensation.
"If other companies used Fannie Mae's logic in applying accounting principles, they could dictate the financial results they desired, and there would be no comparability of financial results between reporting entities even within the same industry," the report said in one passage.
The brunt of the report's accusations are directed at Howard, who Ofheo examiners described as the engineer of suspect accounting machinations.
The report accuses Howard of wearing so many different corporate hats that financial controls and auditing practices were potentially neutered at Fannie Mae.
It also says Fannie Mae improperly disregarded accounting standards relating to loan originations and purchases as well as those related to derivatives used to hedge risk in its vast mortgage portfolio.
The report accuses Fannie Mae of creating a "cookie jar" reserve that Howard could dip into at his discretion to determine the amount of income or expenses the company chose to recognize in any given period.
And the report cites other apparent machinations beginning in 1998 that helped bolster executive compensation at Fannie Mae.
Analysts and financiers say a few of the accusations merit closer scrutiny while most others do not rise to the level of being improprieties much less crimes.
Jonathan E. Gray, a financial analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said that while regulators might well have found important technical infractions of accounting rules, Falcon's motivations had to be considered.
"You have a gentlemen that was told he is not strong enough who now is both the prosecutor and judge," he said.
"The way to keep his job and keep his agency from being phased out was to be tough."
Nonetheless, Gray said that there could be a significant problem if Fannie Mae had a "cookie jar" reserve.
But he dismissed most of the other criticisms in the report as immaterial.
He said the accusation of problems with Fannie Mae's derivatives accounting might require more attention, but he and many others in the financial services industry said that the complex rules governing mortgage derivatives created enormous compliance and financial management headaches with which all CFOs were struggling.
The accounting maneuvers that the report says were used to fatten management's wallets do focus an uncomfortable spotlight on Fannie Mae's lush compensation practices.
It also highlights the baronial ways of an organization funded in part by taxpayers and with a charter to help make housing available to low and moderate income Americans.
Raines earned about $20 million in total compensation last year, while Howard pulled in about $7.7 million.
Since January, Howard has also sold Fannie Mae stock worth about $6.95 million.
A Fannie Mae spokesman said that Howard's stock sales were all scheduled in accordance with a routine sales plan adopted and filed with the SEC in February.
With congressional scrutiny mounting, and the Justice Department investigation now at hand, both Raines and Howard have something at stake that is perhaps more precious to them than money: their reputations.
In an unusual agreement with Ofheo reached last Friday, Fannie Mae said it would institute major changes in its accounting and management practices, including separating Howard's duties and instituting new auditing procedures.
The company also agreed to add $5 billion in fresh funds to its capital reserve within the next nine months, a move apparently intended to shore up its finances in advance of any financial restatements.
That move, however, has not kept investigations from continuing.
On Wednesday, Raines and Howard will have a chance to air their views before members of Congress.
While the complicated nature of the allegations have circumscribed the executives' abilities to speak publicly about recent events, some analysts wonder why one of the most muscular players in Washington has largely fallen silent.
"People are shaking their heads, old timers like me are shaking their heads and saying, 'What kind of game is Fannie playing here?"'
Ely said.
"They have this circling the wagons mentality and are not giving anybody, including their investors, a sense of where this is going."
In their first public response to regulators' allegations that the company manipulated its books, executives of mortgage funding giant Fannie Mae plan to defend its accounting and say the actions regulators have criticized involve interpretations of complicated rules.
"These accounting standards are highly complex and require determinations over which experts often disagree," Fannie Mae chairman and chief executive Franklin Raines says in written testimony prepared for delivery at a congressional hearing Wednesday and made available to The Washington Post.
Some of the regulators' findings "involve highly detailed issues that I would not normally focus on in my role as CEO," Raines says.
Raines says the company strongly disagrees with the allegation that it willfully violated accounting rules to maximize executive bonuses in 1998, according to the testimony.
"What we want to demonstrate is that we intended to do the right thing and we took care to do the right thing," Raines says.
Some of the accounting involved inherently imprecise estimates of the way consumers would respond to changes in interest rates, Raines says.
"Given these imprecisions, Fannie Mae decided to use a range of possible outcomes."
In a report last month, regulators said Fannie manipulated its accounting to present a stable pattern of earnings and tolerated weak internal controls to obscure manipulations.
In 1998, regulators alleged, Fannie improperly delayed booking $200 million of expenses, enabling Raines and other top executives to receive their maximum bonuses, a total of $27.1 million.
As a matter of policy, Fannie allowed itself considerable discretion to postpone some of its income or expenses each fiscal quarter, the regulators said.
The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, Fannie's primary regulator, blamed Fannie's corporate culture and questioned the ability of Fannie's management to correct the problems.
The agency accused Chief Financial Officer J. Timothy Howard of providing inadequate oversight and wearing multiple hats that contributed to a breakdown of checks and balances.
Along with presiding director Ann McLaughlin Korologos and OFHEO Director Armando Falcon Jr., Raines and Howard are scheduled to testify Wednesday before the House capital markets subcommittee.
In prepared testimony, Howard says he believed Fannie's accounting was within the rules.
"All of my judgments regarding accounting issues were made in openness and good faith, with the goal of providing investors with the most meaningful and understandable information possible," Howard says.
Raines' testimony says Fannie's auditor, KPMG LLP, concurred with Fannie's accounting and has not withdrawn its support.
He says that before he certified the financial statements, they were reviewed by dozens of people inside the company.
Fannie faces investigations by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission and litigation by shareholders.
In an agreement with OFHEO, it committed to change its accounting methods going forward.
Whether it must also correct its past financial statements will be determined by the SEC.
For Raines and Howard, the stakes go beyond keeping their jobs.
Executives can face fines and prison for knowingly or willfully certifying false financial statements, and they can be compelled to give back incentive pay and gains from stock sales if past financial statements require correction.
In 2002, against the backdrop of the accounting scandal at Enron Corp., Raines appeared before the committee as a spokesman for the cause of good corporate governance.
"It is wholly irresponsible and unacceptable for corporate leaders to say they did not know or suggest it was not their duty to know about the operations and activities of their company," Raines testified on behalf of the Business Roundtable, a group of chief executives of large corporations.
In prepared testimony, Falcon tells a different story: "Fannie understood the rules and simply chose not to follow them."
Falcon also says that auditor KPMG disagreed with Fannie Mae on the 1998 accounting that enabled executives to collect full bonuses instead of none.
This is a story of absolutely undeniable, certifiably well documented, highly credible and most assuredly air tight and rock solid RUMORS, HUNCHES and SPECULATION.
That said, there are a few things that are, in fact, facts: Whoever wins the election in little more than two weeks will have to quickly put together an administration in John Kerry's case, calling on former Clinton officials and staffers, campaign advisers, perhaps fellow lawmakers, past and present, to put together a White House from scratch.
Another fact: You're more likely to hear a candidate say he botched a question in last week's debate than admit he's talking to a buddy about being secretary of Commerce.
But, to be sure, such personnel planning is in the works on both sides.
A Kerry aide said Tuesday that the campaign had named James A. Johnson, a Washington lawyer who headed the Democrat's search for a running mate, and former Clinton Labor secretary Alexis Herman to start transition planning.
"If they're not planning and selecting people for the key jobs, then they're not behaving responsibly," says Paul C. Light, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in political appointments.
"But they've got to do it very discreetly."
And they have.
This year especially, say those who unapologetically traffic in such rumor and innuendo, there is remarkably little name dropping, with the Kerry team fearful of appearing overconfident or presumptuous and the disciplined Bush team fearful of straying from message.
"It's amazing how few names are out there," says Jay Farrar, a vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
"It's unusual at this point."
Still, there is always some Beltway buzz.
So here's a look at some of the conventional wisdom and informed speculation about who might land where.
And in coming days, the Baltimore Sun will look at a prospective Bush second term Cabinet.
STATE Earlier in the campaign, former Clinton national security adviser Samuel "Sandy" Berger was seen as a likely secretary of State.
But Berger was forced to resign as a top Kerry adviser this summer due to a Justice Department investigation into his removal of classified documents from the National Archives.
Now the odds on favorites for the post are Richard Holbrooke, a former assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton who has been a top Kerry foreign policy adviser, and Sen Joseph Biden, the senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.
While Holbrooke helped bring peace to Bosnia, Biden could have the edge he and Kerry have been close friends for 20 years and speak regularly.
If Kerry should want someone with a more understated persona, there are many other Democrats he could turn to: former Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell, a peace mediator for Northern Ireland and the Middle East, or former Sens Sam Nunn and Gary Hart and former Rep Lee Hamilton, all of whom have been working in the national security and counter terrorism arena since leaving Congress.
(Mitchell or Holbrooke could end up as envoy to the Middle East if passed over for the top State job.)
Not out of the question: former Clinton Treasury secretary Robert Rubin, a Kerry adviser who is expected to land some place high up in the administration if not here, possibly as Federal Reserve chairman, succeeding Alan Greenspan who is expected to step down in January 2006.
DEFENSE No glaringly obvious choice, but instead a number of possibilities including John J. Hamre, president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former Defense official in the Clinton administration, Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee during some of his 24 years in the Senate, or Richard Danzig, Clinton's secretary of the Navy and one of the nation's leading experts on biological warfare.
Other names heard: Sen Carl Levin of Michigan, senior Democrat and former chairman of the Armed Services committee, or Ashton Carter, an assistant secretary of Defense under Clinton now advising Kerry on terrorism and counter proliferation.
Just as Clinton did in appointing Republican Sen William Cohen of Maine to head the Pentagon, Kerry could reach across the aisle for this position.
Kerry could turn to Sen Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a decorated Vietnam veteran and influential moderate who's been critical of Bush's handling of the war, or John McCain, although the Arizona senator has said he's not interested in the job under either Kerry or Bush.
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER Kerry is thought to be considering a number of former White House aides, such as Clinton's deputy national security adviser James B. Steinberg, and Dennis Ross, who was special Middle East coordinator for Clinton and a State Department official for the first President Bush.
Other possibilities: Rand Beers, a national security official under the last four presidents who left his post as a counterterrorism adviser to Bush five days before the start of the Iraq war and joined the Kerry team, or former Kerry primary opponent retired Gen. Wesley Clark.
Another name heard: Joseph S. Nye Jr., former dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and an assistant secretary of Defense for international security in the Clinton administration who is expected to land somewhere in a Kerry White House.
HOMELAND SECURITY Kerry, if elected, could also use this position for a crossover pick, selecting former New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, the Republican chairman of the 9/11 Commission.
Another possible Republican: Richard Armitage, Powell's deputy at State and someone "highly regarded by just about everyone," says one Democratic foreign policy specialist.
Democratic possibilities: Hart, Hamilton, vice chairman of the 9/11 commission, or retiring Florida Sen Bob Graham.
INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR The same people named as possible Homeland Security chief.
JUSTICE One name widely mentioned is Jamie Gorelick, an assistant attorney general in the Clinton administration and more recently a member of the 9/11 Commission.
TREASURY Johnson, a former Fannie Mae chairman, was the early favorite for either treasury secretary or White House chief of staff.
The Washington power broker is considered one of Kerry's closest confidants.
But a large scale accounting scandal at Fannie Mae could dim Johnson's prospects unless it's resolved soon.
A Fannie Mae scandal could block another possible candidate for Treasury, Franklin Raines, Clinton's White House budget director and the current CEO of Fannie Mae.
Democrats point to Roger Altman, deputy Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration (even though he was a bit player in the Whitewater saga), or New York Times reporter turned investment banker Steven Rattner, as two other front runners.
There's less talk and even more of a question mark about the second tier Cabinet posts, although some names have been bandied about: Rep Richard Gephardt as a possible Labor secretary and former Clinton Environmental Protection Agency director Carol Browner as Interior secretary.
After hemming and hawing and bobbing and weaving, the board of directors of Fannie Mae finally jettisoned Franklin D. Raines, the mortgage finance giant's former chief executive, and Timothy Howard, its former chief financial officer, last week.
They appear to have done so only under duress from Fannie's chief regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which in September put the company on notice that its improper accounting had vastly overstated profits and misrepresented its financial position.
The board's reluctance to defenestrate Raines and Howard, who appear to have misstated their company's financial statements to the tune of around $9 billion, fed suspicions that Fannie Mae's directors were loyal to management first, and shareholders second.
Questions of allegiance were also raised when it became clear that Fannie's directors allowed Raines to retire rather than to be fired outright.
That distinction means that he will reap millions of dollars in benefits and stock awards that he may otherwise have lost.
Regulators are now investigating the compensation awarded to Fannie's executives, Raines will receive an annual pension of more than $1 million under the terms of his exit.
With a new year approaching, it seems a perfect time for the Fannie board to look hard and long at its own roles in the mess.
But because nobody ever takes responsibility for wrongdoing today especially not high powered directors of public companies a rigorous self analysis from Fannie's board is unlikely.
Maybe we should do it for them.
Here's the question: Just how independent are Fannie Mae's independent directors?
Under its charter, it has 18 directors.
Thirteen are elected annually by shareholders, and five are appointed by the president.
Two presidential appointees were on the audit committee at the end of 2003, but they are no longer associated with the company.
President Bush has declined to appoint new directors to the board, leaving those seats vacant.
In any enormous accounting debacle, all eyes turn first to a company's audit committee.
The company considers all of them to be independent.
As of last year, they included Thomas P. Gerrity, the chairman and a former dean of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, Frederic V. Malek, the chairman of Thayer Capital Partners, a private equity firm, Anne M. Mulcahy, the chief executive of Xerox, and Joe K. Pickett, the retired chief executive of HomeSide International, parent of a mortgage lending company.
The two presidential appointees on the committee at the time were Taylor C. Segue III, a lawyer in Michigan at Howard & Howard, and William R. Harvey, president of Hampton University in Hampton, Va. Fannie's audit committee is charged with overseeing the accounting, reporting and financial practices of Fannie Mae, including the integrity of its financial statements and its compliance with regulatory requirements.
Hmmm.
Sound like they sort of fell down on the job?
Yes, indeed, said Greg Taxin, chief executive of Glass Lewis, an institutional advisory firm that advised Fannie shareholders to vote against all audit committee members up for re election at Fannie Mae last year.
"The point of that committee is to protect shareholders from precisely what happened here," he said.
"This audit committee needs to be replaced."
A Fannie Mae spokesman said that none of the company's directors were available to comment for this article.
Segue did not return a phone call seeking comment and Harvey could not be reached.
Mulcahy left Fannie's board last September, a few days before OFHEO's devastating report was made public.
She joined the board of Citigroup and said that she could not be a director at two financial services concerns simultaneously.
She can run, but because she became a director at Fannie in 2000 she will not be able to hide from scrutiny of the board's actions during the years it was found to have cooked its books.
A spokesman for Xerox did not return a request for comment from Mulcahy.
While the audit committee members had an obligation to monitor Fannie's accounting, they are not the only directors bearing responsibility for the debacle at the company.
The entire board should don a hair shirt.
Take Ann Korologos.
She is Fannie Mae's presiding director and the person heading the special review committee of the board.
Her tenure at Fannie Mae has been long, since 1994.
The vice chairwoman of the RAND Corp. board of trustees and former secretary of labor under President Ronald Reagan, Korologos must now oversee the investigation of Fannie Mae's accounting practices, governance and structure and executive compensation.
But Korologos' other affiliations show links to Fannie Mae.
She is chairwoman emeritus of the Aspen Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington that has received $280000 in grants from the Fannie Mae Foundation, a nonprofit arm that works for affordable housing, between 1996 and 2002.
She was the institute's chairwoman for the first four of those years.
Malek, another Fannie audit committee member, joins Korologos at Aspen, he is an "active trustee" there.
(The Aspen Institute's original goal, according to its Web site, was "for American business leaders to lift their sights above the possessions which possess them, to confront their own nature as human beings, to regain control over their own humanity by becoming more self aware, more self correcting and hence more self fulfilling.")
Korologos has also been a visiting fellow at the Urban Institute, which has received $2.65 million in grants from the Fannie Mae Foundation since 1990, and she sits on the corporate council of the Conservation Fund, a nonprofit group that works to protect the nation's land and water resources.
The Conservation Fund has received $54000 from the Fannie Mae Foundation since 1995.
Another recipient of Fannie Mae Foundation grants $125000 since 1993 is the Federal City Council, a nonprofit organization based in Washington that works to improve the city.
Korologos was the council's president from 1990 to 1995.
And H. Patrick Swygert, the president of Howard University and a Fannie director since 2000, also has ties to the Federal City Council.
Fannie also considers Swygert to be independent.
But Fannie employed his son in its technology unit until late last spring.
And since 1989, the Fannie Mae Foundation has dispensed 35 grants to Howard University, totaling $555186.
Almost $400000 of those grants went to the university during the years that Swygert was sitting on Fannie's board.
Then there is Malek, the private investor with close ties to Fannie managers.
He is a partner with Raines in the Washington Baseball Club, which is bringing the Montreal Expos to the nation's capital.
A Fannie spokesman said the company's criteria for independence were far stricter than those of the New York Stock Exchange.
Since the company changed its guidelines in 2003, donations to charities with which directors are affiliated do not exceed $100000 a year.
He said the directors acted quickly and appropriately when its regulator, OFHEO, made the findings of its investigation public.
After the Securities and Exchange Commission said it had agreed with OFHEO that Fannie had misrepresented its financial position, the board chose to act more deliberately to make sure the decisions it made were the right ones, the spokesman said.
It is altogether possible that Fannie Mae's board has acted entirely properly and in the shareholders' interests at all times.
But the appearance of conflicts still resonates, especially in its lumbering approach to ousting Raines and Howard.
"This board has all the classic hallmarks of a cozy, friendly board," Taxin, the institutional investors' adviser, said.
"Everything from the personal and professional relationships that go back many years between all these people, to the charity and business relationships that exist.
"After being accused of billion dollar misstatements and having received warnings from the regulator, this board really had to think quite hard whether the CEO and CFO had to be fired.
In this era, that should have been a fairly easy decision to make."
The directors of Fannie Mae, the big mortgage finance company, will meet Sunday to consider the fate of two senior executives who signed off on financial statements that violated accounting rules, people close to the company said Friday.
The two executives, Franklin D. Raines, the chairman and chief executive, and J. Timothy Howard, the chief financial officer, certified financial statements that the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday ordered to be restated because of significant violations in accounting rules over their treatment of derivatives and prepaid loans.
Fannie Mae said in November that a restatement would force it to recognize $9 billion in losses over the last three and a half years, wiping out more than a third of its profits over that period.
Regulators could also force the company to raise its capital levels by billions of dollars, either by selling some of the mortgages it holds in its portfolio or through a securities offering.
As it has in recent days, the company again Friday declined to issue a statement from the directors about how it intended to proceed.
But people close to the company said Raines was seeking a vote of confidence from the board Sunday as he struggles to survive the crisis.
Raines, whose senior management team has come under withering criticism by the company's main regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, testified to Congress two months ago that he expected to be held accountable by Fannie Mae's directors and shareholders if his interpretation of the accounting rules was set aside by the commission.
Long a formidable political power in Washington, Fannie Mae's support has eroded in recent months both because of the conclusions of regulators and because of the growing effectiveness of rival financial institutions.
Raines, who led the Office of Management and Budget at the White House under President Bill Clinton, has lately appeared to have lost much of the support he had from Republicans.
And in recent days, some prominent Democrats have accused the company of being mismanaged and have demanded that Raines return the tens of millions of dollars he has received in bonuses.
If directors decide to remove Raines, the selection of a successor would be politically tricky.
Candidates would need significant credibility in a city that is dominated at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue by Republicans, particularly as the company faces the virtually inevitable prospect of new legislation and tighter regulation.
But they would also have to be committed to the company's affordable housing goals, which are often identified with Democratic lawmakers.
The decision on Raines' successor would ultimately fall to the board of the company, although administration officials could play an important role in recommending or vetoing choices, particularly since the company is in a more vulnerable position.
Among the names circulating in governmental circles on Friday to succeed Raines was Robert B. Zoellick, the U.S. trade representative.
He has worked at Fannie Mae twice before, including one stint in the 1990s when he was a senior executive in charge of its affordable housing business as well as its legal affairs and governmental relations offices.
Zoellick has also been said to be on the short list of contenders to be the next head of the World Bank.
For the last two months, Franklin D. Raines has been the public face of Fannie Mae, testifying before Congress that he believed that the company's accounting methods were sound.
Now his jobs are being taken over by two men who are respected within the company but who are not well known to outsiders.
Raines, who was chief executive and chairman, has been succeeded by two members of the company's board.
Daniel H. Mudd, Fannie Mae's vice chairman and chief operating officer, will become the company's acting chief executive.
Stephen B. Ashley, a real estate executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association, will become Fannie Mae's acting chairman.
Fannie Mae also named another executive, Robert Levin, as its interim chief financial officer, to succeed J. Timothy Howard, who, like Raines, was forced out Tuesday.
Industry specialists say that Mudd and Ashley bring different skills to guide Fannie Mae through perhaps the most challenging period in its history.
Mudd joined Fannie Mae in February 2000 after nearly a decade at GE Capital, where he rose through the management ranks.
He is known as a straight shooter with in depth knowledge of Fannie Mae's business.
What he lacks, however, are the strong political connections that made Raines such a powerful force on Capitol Hill.
"Political savvy has not been his expertise.
He's basically been invisible at Fannie," said Bert Ely, a financial industry consultant who is a longtime critic of the company.
"He's what I call the chief inside guy the guy who makes things run every day.
"A lot of Fannie's challenge right now is keeping the ship afloat and moving ahead," Ely added, "and he's better positioned than anybody on the board."
Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, an associate dean at the Yale School of Management, said of Mudd: "He's a very strong, solid player.
He knows his stuff."
Sonnenfeld added: "He is also known for being more direct.
You don't want any ambiguity as to what is known and what is not known."
Mudd has provided leadership amid economic turmoil before, managing GE Capital's Asia Pacific division through the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s.
He also was an officer in the U.S. Marines and was decorated for combat service in Beirut, Lebanon.
Ashley, who founded the Ashley Group, a large commercial and residential real estate company with properties in New York and Connecticut, has had significant experience both in mortgage lending and in Washington politics.
A former president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group, he testified in front of a Congressional Housing Subcommittee in 1991 in support of Fannie Mae.
Mudd and Ashley have contributed to many political candidates, including several Republicans, according to federal election filings.
"It can hardly be overlooked that, as a Republican Congress is about to undertake a harsh inspection of the company, Fannie Mae is removing Raines and Howard, two men with an apparent preference for Democratic politicians, and elevating Mudd and Ashley, two men who support Republicans," said Jonathan Koppell, a professor at Yale University who has studied the politics of the company.
Ely, the financial industry consultant, said: "This is just the start of a process of cleaning things up.
Fannie Mae has a lot of work ahead."
The announcement late Tuesday night came after a series of discussions over the last few days as board members debated Raines' future at Fannie Mae.
It came after the company's main regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, demanded significant changes to the company's senior management and threatened to declare that Fannie Mae had failed to meet its capital requirements, people close to the process said.
US mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae, found guilty of violating accounting rules and accused of paying dizzying bonuses to its bosses, has made public the entitlements and compensation claimed by its departing chief executive and finance director.
In a document delivered to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Fannie Mae also acknowledged having received a letter from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), informing the company of its investigation into pay and bonuses of former chief executive Franklin Raines and of former finance director Timothy Howard, both of whom were sacked on December 21.
Raines can claim 600000 dollars in salary for the period from December 22 to June 22, 2005, the date at which his retirement becomes effective, the Fannie Mae document shows.
Raines' monthly pension payments should then amount to 116300 dollars.
Among other things, the ex chief executive also has more than 1.6 million stock options and can claim 8.7 million dollars in deferred payments from Fannie Mae.
Howard could be eligible for 84000 dollars in salary between December 20 and the end of January 2005, before claiming 36000 dollars a month once retired.
Fannie Mae, embroiled in an accounting scandal, now faces rising suspicions about pay and benefits for its former directors.
In the dossier delivered to the SEC, Fannie Mae agreed to provide the OFHEO with information requested.
Following the departure of Raines and Howard, vice president Daniel Mudd was named interim chief executive while executive vice president Robert Levin was promoted to finance director, the company said.
The directors of Fannie Mae concluded a special meeting on Sunday without announcing whether they would support or replace the company's senior management, including its chairman and chief executive, Franklin D. Raines, and its chief financial officer, J. Timothy Howard.
Both executives certified financial statements that the Securities and Exchange Commission have ordered revised because of violations of accounting rules.
The directors have met several times to discuss management and capital issue since the commission's decision on Wednesday that the company had violated accounting standards and must restate its earnings for the past three and a half years and must raise its capital level.
The company said previously that any requirement that it restate its earnings could lead it to declare about $9 billion in losses, wiping out more than a third of its earnings over the period.
The senior management of Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest buyer of mortgages, has come under increasing political and regulatory pressure after withering criticism from its main regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight.
That agency concluded in September that company executives had manipulated expenses to smooth earnings and meet projected financial targets that would permit the executives to win maximum bonuses.
In a letter on Sept 20, Armando Falcon Jr., the director of the oversight office, told Fannie Mae directors that the agency had found significant evidence that raised "doubts concerning the validity of previously reported financial results, the adequacy of regulatory capital, the quality of management supervision and the overall safety and soundness of the enterprise."
Raines has denied that the expenses were manipulated for such purposes.
The SEC and the Justice Department continue to examine those issues.
In testimony before Congress two months ago, Raines suggested that the oversight office was embarking on a witch hunt and had improperly prepared and issued its report.
He predicted that he and Fannie Mae would be vindicated by the SEC.
Raines' counterattack initially relieved some pressure on Fannie Mae and its senior management.
But the agency suffered a major setback on Wednesday when the SEC's chief accountant said that the company had violated accounting rules on its treatment of investments in derivatives and in the way it accounted for losses from prepaid loans.
The long battle between sense and Silicon Valley reached a milestone Thursday, when federal regulators published a rule requiring companies to account properly for stock options.
High tech firms continue to argue that the best way to account for options is a matter of opinion and that their opinion is as valid as the one regulators arrived at after thousands of hours of consultation.
But high tech's highhandedness has nothing on the leadership at Fannie Mae.
Bosses at the federally chartered mortgage giant also formed their own opinion of what an accounting rule should say.
They did this not merely before the rule in question went into effect but afterward.
This arrogance is almost as stunning as the $9 billion overstatement of profits that resulted.
Fannie's top managers looked at the federal rule on accounting for futures, swaps and other such financial instruments, and they decided they didn't agree with it.
They requested permission from regulators to go their own way, and when this was denied they went their own way anyhow.
They behaved like a passenger who sees a "No Smoking" sign, checks with the conductor that the sign means what it says, and then nonchalantly lights up.
We've all been pondering the Kerik question: How did President Bush's serially flawed Homeland Security Department nominee imagine he could survive the confirmation process?
Fannie Mae's behavior raises the same question: How did its managers believe they could get away with this?
Perhaps they hoped to hide behind financial complexity: For a long time, critics have raised questions about Fannie's financial soundness, and Fannie has fired back with firm denials.
It was hard to know whom to believe.
In September a devastating report on Fannie put the lender on the defensive.
But Fannie's chief executive, Franklin Raines, continued to raise the complexity defense, saying the accounting weaknesses identified in the report were a matter of interpretation.
Now the chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission has ruled that the report was right and that Fannie had violated accounting standards, overstating its profit by 38 percent since January 2001.
Tough consequences will follow: The Justice Department is pursuing a criminal investigation, the SEC is pursuing a civil one, the House promises hearings, and class action lawsuits are in the works.
The price of Fannie's accounting hubris is going to be significant.
But the most important response to Fannie Mae's humiliation goes beyond punishment of individuals.
Fannie Mae is the second biggest financial institution in the country, and its collapse could destabilize financial markets and damage the economy.
The September report raised a question about "the overall safety and soundness of the enterprise," suggesting that a collapse is alarmingly conceivable.
Federal oversight of Fannie has traditionally been light, not least because of the lender's clout in Congress.
It's time to invigorate it.
It's been something of a bad week for Frank Raines.
First, the D.C. Council managed to unravel a carefully negotiated deal to bring Major League Baseball back to Washington, which Raines, as a leading member of the would be local ownership group, has been working on for years.
Then Time Warner and America Online agreed to pay more than half a billion dollars to settle civil and criminal charges stemming from allegedly fraudulent accounting practices dating to when AOL was a separate company and Director Raines was a member of its audit committee.
Raines was also a member of the Time Warner audit committee when those practices were vigorously defended after being exposed by my intrepid colleague, Alec Klein, in The Washington Post.
Finally, the Securities and Exchange Commission concluded that Fannie Mae, where Raines is chairman and chief executive, had engaged in questionable accounting practices over the past four years practices that Raines stubbornly defended even after serious questions had been raised.
My guess is that there will be plenty of quiet whispering around the punch bowl at the annual Raines Christmas party this year.
In the baseball matter, of course, Raines is as much a victim of the District's political bumbling as the rest of us.
But what's baffling about the two accounting imbroglios is how Raines and so many other smart executives and professionals could have been so stupid.
Let's give the directors at Time Warner and AOL the benefit of the doubt and assume that they knew nothing about the true nature of the transactions with PurchasePro when a reporter from The Washington Post showed up with documents suggesting they were a sham.
What was a director to do?
Considering that all this was happening in the wake of the unfolding Enron scandal, the answer was pretty clear.
You ask your auditor, H. Stephen Hurst of Ernst & Young, to review the transactions again.
And after Hurst reaffirms that they are kosher, you hire Thomas Yannucci of Kirkland & Ellis, a lawyer who specializes in defending companies against unfavorable press stories, to relay these assurances to The Post and argue against publishing Klein's story.
Now, two years and many subpoenas later, it turns out that Klein was right and Time Warner shareholders are out $500 million.
So can someone please explain to me why Ernst & Young is still Time Warner's auditor and why Hurst is still licensed to certify accounts of public companies?
Or why Stephen Bollenbach, the Hilton hotels chief, and Fay Vincent, the former baseball commissioner, are still on the Time Warner audit committee?
Or why any editor would believe Tom Yannucci when he shows up to declare a company's virtue and demand that a story not be published?
At Fannie Mae, Raines seemed to understand the stakes back in October when he told a House committee he had checked and rechecked his firm's accounting and would take personal responsibility for it.
So many questions had been raised about these issues over the past two years that there are really only two possibilities: Raines either knew that Fannie's accounting was questionable, which I doubt, or he should have known, in which case he failed in his duty of care.
In either case, with $9 billion in reported profit in jeopardy, he is now duty bound to resign and take Chief Financial Officer Timothy Howard with him.
Moreover, as Fannie directors resume their urgent discussions this weekend, they need to move quickly to replace KPMG as the company's auditor for having provided them with bad advice.
And the members of the audit committee Tom Gerrity, the former dean of the Wharton School of Management, mortgage banker Joe Pickett, and real estate developer Stephen B. Ashley should seriously consider tendering their resignations as well.
Like Raines and the auditors, they are selected and paid handsomely for their integrity and their good judgment.
With the mishandling of these accounting issues, one of those qualities has been seriously called into question.
If you are responsible for massive amounts of accounting, maybe it's not a good idea to criticize someone else's accounting.
You might end up like Fannie Mae CEO Franklin D. Raines.
Raines, 55, a former budget director under President Clinton, has long held himself up as a paragon of corporate ethics.
But now it looks as if Raines is about $9 billion short at the company he runs.
The Federal National Mortgage Association, a.k.a. Fannie Mae, is a government sponsored private company and the largest source of funds for the U.S. mortgage market.
It holds nearly $1 trillion in debt, making it the second largest debtholder behind the government.
After an advisory from the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Fannie Mae is due for an earnings restatement that will erase more than a third of its profits over the past three and a half years.
During this period, Raines made $14 million in salary and bonus, plus $25.6 million in incentive pay.
Yet before the highly paid Raines was dodging his own accounting scandal, he was wagging a finger at others.
Here's what he told Congress about Enron in 2002: "It is wholly irresponsible and unacceptable for corporate leaders to say they did not know ,about the operations and activities of their company, particularly when it comes to risks that threaten the fundamental viability of their company."
Then in January, Raines brought The Business Roundtable Institute for Corporate Ethics to the University of Virginia.
Raines is co chairman of the Roundtable, a club for CEOs from leading corporations.
And who better to pontificate about ethics than a bunch of CEOs who lord over 10 million employees?
"The CEOs of the Business Roundtable are aiming to make a lasting contribution to business ethics and the way our companies are run," Raines said.
But what will be Raines' lasting contribution?
Since accounting woes surfaced at Fannie Mae, he argues that he relied on advice from Fannie Mae's auditor, KPMG, and adhered to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP.
According to Monday's Wall Street Journal, Raines privately makes the case that he did nothing at Fannie Mae that warrants his dismissal.
Does any of this sound familiar?
"Getting numbers wrong by $9 billion is someone's fault," said John Bazley, an accounting professor at the University of Denver's Daniels College of Business.
"In this environment, it tends to put the CEO on the spot."
Raines refuses to be put on the spot.
Fannie Mae's regulator the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight alleged in September that the company made errors.
In October, Raines went before Congress and denied the accusation.
Then he went to the SEC for a second opinion, only to be told last week that Fannie Mae should restate earnings.
Accounting at Fannie Mae is complex.
The area in which Fannie Mae misstated earnings derivatives is exceedingly complex.
Derivatives are financial contracts that Fannie Mae uses to hedge against interest rate fluctuations.
Their value is derived from debt, securities, currencies and commodities.
Accounting for them involves assumptions and predictions a thick realm of grey.
Perhaps Raines believed Fannie Mae could hide in this complexity.
But the issue that the SEC addressed last week is simple.
Essentially, Fannie Mae didn't like the accounting rules regarding derivatives, so it made up its own.
"Fannie Mae internally developed its own unique methodology," SEC Chief Accountant Donald T. Nicolaisen wrote.
This would be like me as a taxpayer making up my own depreciation schedules to calculate deductions instead of using those prescribed by the government.
It wouldn't hold up in an audit.
Yet Raines signed off on the books and defended the methods.
Fannie Mae's board met Sunday night to discuss Raines' future.
No decision has been announced, but it's a possibility Raines and a few others will be stepping down.
It's time for corporate leaders to quit paying lip service to the ideals of corporate governance, ethics, integrity and transparency, and just tell the truth in their financial statements.

Franklin Raines stepped down Tuesday as chairman and chief executive of Fannie Mae, as the company's directors ended days of tense and emotional deliberations and bowed to pressure from regulators who wanted him out.
J. Timothy Howard, the company's longtime chief financial officer, also is leaving.
Raines' departure was structured as an early retirement.
Howard resigned.
The departures come less than a week after the Securities and Exchange Commission directed the giant mortgage funding company to make accounting corrections that could erase $9 billion of past profit.
The Washington D.C. based housing finance company, which stands behind or owns a quarter of the nation's mortgages, faces a criminal investigation by the Justice Department, a civil investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, an ongoing probe of other accounting issues by its main regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, and class action lawsuits by investors.
In addition, Fannie's board has hired outside lawyers to investigate the regulators' allegations.
The government sponsored company has been on the defensive since September, when OFHEO alleged that Fannie had systematically manipulated accounting estimates, ignored accounting requirements it had lobbied unsuccessfully against and operated with weak internal controls that helped obscure the other problems.
The report said that Fannie Mae delayed booking $200 million of expenses in 1998, which allowed Raines and other top executives to receive millions of dollars in bonuses linked to Fannie's profit.
A source with knowledge of the board's deliberations in recent days described a sometimes painful debate.
Raines, the source said, at times argued passionately that he had done nothing wrong.
Raines, 55, is one of the most prominent African Americans in corporate America.
He rose from a family that supplemented work with welfare to become a Rhodes scholar, president of the Harvard University Board of Overseers, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton and a leader of the Washington business community.
His compensation last year, including $3 million in stock options, totaled about $20 million.
Fannie's federal regulator, however, demanded management changes, holding Raines responsible for a corporate culture that emphasized stable earnings at the expense of accurate financial disclosures.
Sources said the regulator was determined to initiate a public proceeding to remove Raines if the board did not act.
The costs of an all out fight with a federal regulator would be too great, Fannie's board ultimately concluded, so Raines was told he would have to go.
The board had decided by Monday evening to accept Howard's resignation.
But its announcement was held up, as directors continued to discuss different scenarios in which Raines would remain chief executive, including the appointment of an independent chairman.
In a statement, Raines said: "I previously stated that I would hold myself accountable if the SEC determined that significant mistakes were made in the Company's accounting.
Although, to my knowledge, the Company has always made good faith efforts to get its accounting right, the SEC has determined that mistakes were made.
By my early retirement, I have held myself accountable."
Ann McLaughlin Korologos, the presiding non management director, thanked Raines and Howard for their "many contributions" and said the board "takes these steps today to move the company forward."
The company also announced that the board's audit committee has dismissed KPMG LLP, the outside accounting firm that audited the financial statements Fannie will now correct.
Armando Falcon Jr., head of OFHEO, commended the board's action and said, "We are encouraged that the Board's announcement signals a new culture and a new direction for Fannie Mae."
The upheaval at Fannie Mae comes a year after similar problems at its smaller rival, McLean, Va. based Freddie Mac, forced out two Freddie chief executives in rapid succession.
The company announced that board member Stephen Ashley, a former president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, will become non executive chairman.
Daniel Mudd, the company's vice chairman and chief operating officer, will serve as interim chief executive.
And Robert Levin, executive vice president, will serve as interim chief financial officer while the company seeks permanent replacements.
Though it was not apparent at the time, Raines's downfall began in early 2003, when Freddie Mac disclosed that it had made billions of dollars of accounting errors.
Ensuing investigations revealed that Freddie Mac executives had gone to elaborate lengths to make its earnings growth appear smooth.
Given the similar nature of two companies, OFHEO decided to take a closer look at Fannie Mae's accounting.
As that review got underway, Raines complained that Fannie was being unfairly tainted by its competitors' troubles, and he denied that Fannie had similar problems.
In its September report, OFHEO alleged that since a key accounting rule took effect in 2001, Fannie improperly excluded from earnings changes in the value of derivatives, complex financial instruments that can be used to speculate for profit or hedge against risk.
Freddie Mac violated the same rule.
Howard, 56, who joined Fannie Mae in 1982 and served as chief financial officer since 1990, oversaw Fannie's accounting.
At a congressional hearing in October, Raines pointed to the SEC as the authority on accounting matters and pinned his hopes on a favorable decision from the agency.
Last week, the SEC's top accountant sided with OFHEO on questions of accounting policy, saying that instead of following the requirements, "Fannie Mae internally developed its own unique methodology."
On Capitol Hill, the scandal at Fannie Mae has reinvigorated efforts to create a more powerful regulator for Fannie and Freddie.
Members of Congress and the Bush administration generally agree that the companies' primary regulator, OFHEO, is ill equipped to oversee huge, complex institutions that could send shock waves through the economy and financial system if they ever foundered.
Fannie Mae, for example, has debts to bondholders of $957 billion, equal to about a fifth of the publicly held portion of the U.S. national debt.
In addition, the company guarantees principal and interest payments on $1.9 trillion of mortgage backed securities.
Raines' successor must add billions of dollars to Fannie's reserves, which will be below the company's regulatory minimum when it records the additional losses.
When he became chief executive in 1999, Raines committed Fannie to achieving double digit earnings growth for five consecutive years, and he set a goal of doubling earnings over that period.
The company achieved the goals, but the corrected accounting could change the picture dramatically, and the need to increase Fannie's reserves will make it harder for the company to grow in the near future.
Established in the 1930s as the country was emerging from the Great Depression, Fannie borrows money by issuing bonds and uses that money to buy mortgages from lenders, thereby giving the lenders cash to issue more loans.
Fannie also packages mortgages into securities that are sold to investors, along with the company's guarantee that it will pay investors the principal and interest on the loans if the borrowers default.
Some corporate governance specialists were stunned by allegations that Fannie engaged in accounting manipulations years after the watershed scandals at Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc.
Those debacles inspired tough new legal penalties for accounting manipulations, served a warning to corporate bosses and seemed to bring about a change in the culture of America's boardrooms.
In the aftermath of Enron's collapse, Raines became a spokesman for the cause of good corporate governance.
On behalf of the Business Roundtable, a group of chief executives of many of the nation's largest corporations, Raines led a task force that prescribed best practices for corporate leaders, and he publicly criticized executives who disclaimed responsibility for wrongdoing within their organizations.
Raines and Fannie Mae "have been so arrogant, not just to shareholders but so arrogant in Washington, that it's kind of a well deserved comeuppance," said Sarah Teslik, former head of the Council of Institutional Investors.
But Arne Christenson, a former Fannie Mae executive who was before that a top aide to then Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, said Raines will be difficult to replace.
"The thing about Frank is, he had a blend of business acumen and political savvy that was uniquely helpful to Fannie Mae," Christensen said.
"I'm sure he (Raines) would have preferred to have stayed, but things are the way they are," said attorney R. Timothy Columbus, a close friend of Raines.
"He did what he had to do."

Mortgage giant Fannie Mae announced Friday it was withholding millions of dollars in bonuses from its top executives as it continued to come to grips with revelations of serious financial reporting problems.
The nation's biggest backer of home mortgages announced in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission that its board of directors had voted to eliminate cash bonuses that would have been paid for the performance of top executives in 2004.
The company said it was also postponing the payment of any stock awards for last year.
This action will affect 43 top officials who will lose millions of dollars in scheduled performance bonuses.
The company also said in the filing that Fannie Mae controller Leanne Spencer, the company's top accounting officer, had "stepped down" earlier this week to take a lesser role as special adviser to Michael Williams, the president of the company's Internet business.
Fannie Mae's chief executive, Franklin Raines, and its top financial officer, Timothy Howard, were forced out last month after revelations that the company will have to restate some $9 billion (euro6.9 billion) in earnings, or about one third of its profits, dating to 2001.
To begin making up that shortfall and increase the company's capital reserves, Fannie Mae announced on Tuesday that it was cutting its first quarter dividend payment by half, to 26 cents per share.
The company is also expected to sell off part of its portfolio of mortgages and raise fresh capital by issuing stock.
Regulators in the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight ordered the company in September to boost its capital cushion, the amount of reserves it has to guard against financial losses, by some $5 billion (euro3.8 billion) by the middle of 2005.
In its new SEC filing on Friday, Fannie Mae did not disclose the total amount in cash bonuses that were being eliminated, and company spokesmen also refused to give a figure other than to indicate it would be in the millions of dollars and would affect the company's 43 top executives.
In 2003, just the top five officers at Fannie Mae received $8.2 million (euro6.3 million) in cash bonuses.
The action by the board will mean that Raines and Howard will be denied cash bonuses they would have received for 2004.
The board had come under heavy criticism in recent weeks for allowing both men to leave the company with lucrative severance packages.
In another action disclosed on Friday, the Fannie Mae board voted to eliminate the requirement that the company's chief executive officer, the position formerly held by Raines, also serve as chairman of the company's board.
The National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) Wednesday established a strategic alliance with U.S. based Bridge Pharmaceuticals on the research and development of cancer medicines.
The first cooperation project between the two sides will be the clinical development in Taiwan of two new cancer medicines, SR 13668 and SR 16158, NHRI officials said.
The two medicines have been tested on animals in the United States and have been shown to be effective in inhibiting the growth of cancer cells, the officials said.
The first phase of clinical trials on humans is expected to start next year in Taiwan, they said.
The SR 13668 is for oral consumption and can curb the AKT retroviral oncogene protein, which is extremely active in patients with malignant tumors, including breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, ovary cancer and colon cancer, according to the NHRI.
The SR 16158, meanwhile, is intended for the treatment of breast cancer.
Jacqueline Whang Peng, director of the NHRI's Division of Cancer Research, said that compared with existing cancer medicines, the two drugs have produced better therapeutic results and less side effects.
Compared with hormonal drugs, SR 16158 is less likely to trigger cardiovascular disease in patients, Whang Peng said.
She said the two new medicines will be available on the market three years from now at the earliest if the clinical trials proceed smoothly.
An Australian research suggests that taking oral contraceptives reduces the risk of breast cancer carrying breast cancer genes.
The study found those with an inherited mutation in the BRCA1 gene, a known risk factor for early onset breast cancer, were about four times less likely to develop the disease if they were taking oral contraceptives.
The study was conducted by researchers from University of Melbourne on some 2000 women under the age of 40, including 1156 breast cancer patients in Australia, Canada and the United States.
The findings go against the researchers' original hypothesis that the pill would increase breast cancer in high risk groups.
"We really thought that oral contraceptives would be bad," John Hopper, director of the university's Center for Genetic Epidemiology, was quoted by Australian Associated Press as saying Wednesday.
The study suggested young women who carried inherited variations of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes should not be discouraged from using oral contraceptives.
"We don't believe that you can say oral contraceptive use is going to be the magic elixir yet but we do say that the use of oral contraceptives should not be contraindicated (in women with a high genetic breast cancer risk)," Hopper said.
"There's no strong guidelines but, in general, women are being advised cautiously not to use oral contraceptives if they are carriers ,but that's not necessarily found in evidence," he said.
"They definitely have the power to make life decisions about the use of oral contraceptives not worrying overly about the effect it may have on their breast cancer risks," he said.
A new type of drug shows growing promise as a more potent way for many breast cancer patients to significantly cut their risk of a recurrence, researchers reported Wednesday.
The latest findings from a large international study also found that the drug, called an aromatase inhibitor, appears to sharply reduce the chances that many breast cancer patients will develop a new cancer in the other breast or have the cancer spread elsewhere.
The results were so strong that researchers recommended that most postmenopausal women struck by breast cancer should immediately begin taking an aromatase inhibitor as soon as they complete the standard regimen of surgery, radiation and, often, chemotherapy, instead first going on an older drug.
Other experts praised the findings as confirming that aromatase inhibitors should play an important role in treating breast cancer patients but said it remains unclear whether all eligible women should immediately begin an aromatase inhibitor.
Some patients might still first try the older drug, tamoxifen, they said.
"This is a very large study and it confirms there is a benefit and that aromatase inhibitors should become part of standard therapy," said JoAnne Zujewski of the National Cancer Institute.
"But the exact timing of how one should use them remains unclear."
Before the development of aromatase inhibitors, women whose breast cancers were promoted by the hormone estrogen which is true of most were given tamoxifen to reduce their risk of recurrence.
Tamoxifen blunts estrogen's effects.
But tamoxifen can be taken only for five years and increases the risk of uterine cancer and blood clots that can cause strokes.
Aromatase inhibitors block the formation of estrogen in the first place and carry none of those risks.
They do not, however, reduce the risk of osteoporosis, as tamoxifen does.
But it's been unclear whether women should take tamoxifen first and then switch to an aromatase inhibitor, or simply take an aromatase inhibitor from the start.
The new findings are from a study involving 9366 postmenopausal women with early, estrogen sensitive breast cancer who took either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor called Arimidex (known generically as anastrozole).
The researchers had previously reported data from three years of study that showed Arimidex prevented more recurrences than tamoxifen.
The new data found the benefits continued after five years and appeared to be even greater, the researchers said.
Tamoxifen cut the recurrence risk by about 50 percent, Arimidex appeared to reduce recurrence by an extra 26 percent, the researchers said.
"We think women should start right away with an aromatase inhibitor," said Anthony Howell of the Christie Hospital in Manchester, England, who presented the findings at a meeting in San Antonio, Texas.
"We think the benefit justifies offering this treatment as early as possible."
Other research presented at the meeting found that switching to Arimidex or another aromatase inhibitor, called Aromasin, was more effective than staying on tamoxifen for five years.
"This data strengthens the thinking that tamoxifen is tending to die out as a treatment and is being replaced by these aromatase inhibitors," Howell said.
But other experts said the data simply confirmed the study's earlier findings and that the results of other ongoing studies were needed before changing the standard recommendations.
"I would say that these results generally provide confirmation of what was previously seen in this trial but are not strikingly different," said Eric Winer of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.
Winer chaired a panel for the American Society of Clinical Oncology that last month recommended that aromatase inhibitors become part of the standard arsenal of drugs used to treat breast cancer, but that the exact strategy of how to use them remains unclear.
"We still should be careful not to rush to judgment as to what the best way should be to use these drugs," Winer said.
The new study was funded by AstraZeneca, which makes the drug, but Howell said the researchers had complete independence.
Deficiencies in the ability of cells to repair damaged DNA are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, researchers at Columbia University said Monday.
A latest study led by Regina Santella at the Columbia University School of Public Health is due to published in the Jan 19 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
DNA repair is the system of defenses designed to protect the integrity of the genome.
Earlier studies have suggested that deficiency in cells' capacity for DNA repair contributes to the accumulation of DNA damage and accelerates the genetic changes leading to cancer.
To evaluate whether weakened DNA repair capacity in the nucleotide excision pathway that fixes DNA alterations known as bulky DNA adducts is associated with breast cancer risk, Santella and colleagues analyzed cell lines generated from blood samples from pairs of sisters, in which one had been diagnosed with breast cancer but the other had not.
They found that DNA repair capacity was lower in breast cancer patients than in the control subjects.
Deficient DNA repair capacity was associated with a twofold increase in the risk of breast cancer.
In addition, when the data were stratified into quartiles of DNA repair capacity, the risk of breast cancer was three times higher among women with the poorest DNA repair capacity compared with those with the highest.
"These data support the hypothesis that deficient DNA repair capacity is associated with susceptibility to breast cancer and may be a valuable in vitro biomarker to identify high risk subjects, especially in familial breast cancer families," researchers wrote in their paper.
"It is unclear at this time whether there are any interventions that could alter DNA repair capacity and what effect such interventions might have on risk," they said.
Other scientists remarked on the need for developing better laboratory tests for such studies.
"When DNA repair capacity can be measured easily and quickly, the scientific community will be able to clearly understand the role of DNA repair capacity in the development of cancer and possibly to develop interventions to reduce cancer incidence and mortality," they wrote in an editorial in the journal.
Scientists in the Netherlands say they have developed a powerful diagnostic tool, based on a telltale gene "signature," that could help breast cancer patients avoid unnecessary follow up treatment.
The research, reported in next Saturday's issue of the British medical weekly The Lancet, is focussed on a condition called lymph node negative breast cancer.
If diagnosed in time, up to 70 percent of women who are given surgery or radiotherapy for this disease are cured.
The treatment usually entails follow up care in the form of chemotherapy powerful drugs that act on tumours or hormone treatment.
Such medication is routinely recommended as a precaution to prevent any recurrence of the cancer.
Only about a third of all patients actually need the follow up therapy, however, which can be aggressive with big side effects.
Dutch doctors believe that the new diagnostic can help pinpoint those women who are genetically more at risk of a recurrence than others, and this could spare low risk patients from having to undergo unnecessary follow up treatment.
They found a "signature" of protein markers, expressed by 76 genes, which were frequently found among 115 stored tumours taken from patients who had lymph node negative breast cancer.
The team then tested the "signature" on the genetic profile of 171 other cancer patients who had had initial treatment for their tumour and whose health had been carefully monitored over the next five years to see if the cancer had returned.
They found the "signature" was 93 percent accurate in predicting those who had had a recurrence within five years, although it was much less precise (48 percent accurate) in predicting patients whose disease did not return in that time.
Breast cancer, like ovarian cancer, is a "silent killer" of women.
This is why doctors recommend regular mammary screenings and why they are so keen on getting a tool to help identify women who could be genetically at risk.
The study is led by John Foekens of the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam.
Several previous studies have also identified gene "signatures" to test for breast cancer, although this is the largest by far.
The problem though is that the proposed "signatures" either overlap or are different.
At the moment, there is no global agreement as to what should be the common set of genes that should be incorporated in a standard test.
An underactive thyroid gland a condition afflicting as many as 20 percent of older women also apparently lessens a woman's chances of developing an aggressive form of breast cancer, according to a study that provides new evidence for a long debated link.
Doctors at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center found that women who were diagnosed with hypothyroidism were less likely to have breast cancer, and those who did were likely to have a less aggressive form of the disease.
The study spotlights the role that hormones besides estrogen play in development and progression of the hormone sensitive cancer, said Dr Massimo Cristofanilli, an associate professor of breast oncology and the lead author of the study.
The results could help researchers develop new medications for treatment and prevention of breast cancer, he said.
"We have been focusing only on one hormone acting on the breast tissue, but there is a variety of other hormones that create the environment for the development of cancer," Cristofanilli said.
"Thyroid appears to be one of them."
Scientists long have been intrigued by the role of the thyroid gland in breast disease.
More than a century ago, a doctor in Scotland fed thyroid hormone to women whose breast cancer had spread throughout their body.
Since then, smaller studies on women with several thyroid conditions have generated conflicting results.
The thyroid is a butterfly shaped gland in the front of the neck that produces a variety of hormones regulating body metabolism.
Thyroid hormones affect growth, fertility and the body's use of nutrients and oxygen.
Hypothyroidism occurs when production of these vital hormones slows down.
Symptoms can include dry skin, weight gain, sensitivity to cold, forgetfulness and fertility problems.
The cause is unknown, although some evidence points to an immune system malfunction, Cristofanilli noted.
The study was published Monday in the online journal Cancer, a publication of the American Cancer Society.
Scientists compared 1036 women who had been treated for breast cancer to 1088 healthy women who had attended the hospital's screening clinics.
Women with underactive thyroid glands had a 61 percent lower risk of having invasive breast cancer, or aggressive cancer that had spread into surrounding breast tissue or lymph nodes.
Cristofanilli noted that the women with underactive thyroid glands all were taking thyroid hormone replacements, which suggests it is not the thyroid hormone level itself that influences the growth of breast cancer.
He said doctors need to study whether the immune system response in these women is playing some role in slowing or preventing breast cancer.
"This is good news, because it indicates that the condition that brings out hypothyroidism is protective enough that it either delays or creates the possibility of developing a less aggressive form of the disease," he said.

Analyzing cells from milk ducts doesn't reliably detect breast cancer, U.S. researchers reported Tuesday dashing hopes that the experimental technique could diagnose high risk women sooner.
Because most breast cancer starts in a milk duct, scientists had theorized that flushing those ducts with fluid might draw out cancerous cells even before they could be spotted on a mammogram.
Mammograms work very well at detecting early breast cancer, but they're not perfect.
They don't work as well on the more dense breast tissue of women under 50, so scientists are testing alternatives like MRI scans to screen younger women at high risk of cancer because a close relative had it.
The milk duct technique, called ductal lavage, is among those experimental alternatives.
To test it, doctors at Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital administered ductal lavage to 39 women just before their breasts were removed for known cancer.
Doctors put an anesthetic on the nipple and inserted a threadlike catheter to flush milk ducts with fluid that dislodges and draws out cells.
Ductal lavage signaled cancer in only a fraction of these women, lead researcher Dr Seema Khan reported Tuesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
The test uncovered clear cancer signs in just 13 percent of the cancerous breasts tested, and possible signs in 42 percent.
"Ductal lavage should not be recommended to high risk women as a technique to detect cancer earlier than imaging modalities" she concluded.
Among the problems: There are numerous milk ducts in the breast, and it's impossible to know in advance if ductal lavage produced cells from the one that contains cancer.
And even when it did, Khan's research found the cells produced didn't always signal cancer.
The "meticulously performed" research supports an earlier, smaller study that found similar failures, noted Dr Carol Fabian of the Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, in an accompanying editorial.
"Ductal lavage cannot be considered a sensitive screening tool," Fabian agreed.
But other studies of ductal lavage are continuing, to see if the technique can be used to help evaluate women's risk of breast cancer.
Olive oil can help fight breast cancer, a discovery that researchers said in a study out Sunday could guide the development of related treatment.
"Our findings underpin epidemiological studies that show that the Mediterranean diet has significant protective effects against cancer, heart disease and ageing," said the study's lead author Javier Menendez, of Northwestern University's Feinberg medical school in Chicago.
Researchers showed in a series of laboratory experiments on breast cancer cells that oleic acid, found in olive oil, dramatically cuts the levels of a cancer promoting gene called Her 2/neu (also known as erb B 2), according to Menendez.
High levels of the gene occur in over a fifth of breast cancer patients and are associated with highly aggressive tumors that have a poor prognosis, according to findings reported in the January 10 Annals of Oncology.
Oleic acid suppressed the gene, and other tests showed that it boosted an antibody treatment trastuzumab (Herceptin), which targets the gene and has helped to prolong the lives of many breast cancer patients, the researchers said.
Menendez said the findings should not only help in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which individual dietary fatty acids regulate the malignant behavior of breast cancer cells, but also suggested eating oleic acid may help Herceptin work in breast cancer patients with the Her 2/neu gene.
"To our knowledge this is the first report that a dietary monounsaturated fatty acid previously suggested to be protective against breast cancer significantly down regulates the expression of Her 2/neu, cutting it by up to 46 percent.
Her 2/neu is one of the most important oncogenes in breast cancer," said Menendez.
"In our tests, oleic acid's inhibition of Her 2/neu synergistically interacted with Herceptin based immunotherapy by promoting the death of breast cancer cells exhibiting high levels of the oncogene.
"Additionally, alongside the sensitizing effect of oleic acid on the efficacy of Herceptin we found it increased the expression of a protein (p27Kip1), a tumor suppresser protein, which is implicated in the development of resistance to Herceptin treatment."
Menendez worked with Ruth Lupu, director of the Evanston Northwestern Health Research Institute's Breast Cancer Translational Program and Ramon Colomer, head of the Medical Oncology Division at Institut Catala d' Oncologia in Girona, Spain.
A new U.S. study will investigate genetic and environmental causes of breast cancer by enrolling 50000 sisters of women already diagnosed with the disease.
The Sister Study, conducted by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, part of the government's National Institutes of Health, is the largest study of its kind.
"By studying sisters who share the same genes, often had similar experiences and environments, and are at twice the risk of developing breast cancer, we have a better chance of learning what causes this disease," Dr Dale Sandler, the study's principal investigator, said in a statement Monday.
The sisters who volunteer will donate blood, urine, toenails even household dust to help uncover how daily rituals and routines, as well as genetics, factor into breast cancer risk.
"Genes are important, but they don't explain it all," said Sandler, chief of the epidemiology branch at the environmental health institute.
"The truth is that only half of breast cancer cases can be attributed to known factors."
For instance, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that normally limit cell growth.
Women who inherit an altered version of either gene have a higher risk of getting breast or ovarian cancer.
BRCA1 and BRCA2, however, are implicated in just 5 percent to 10 percent of breast cancer cases.
Breast cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, after skin cancer.
Some 215990 American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, according to the American Cancer Society.
The disease will kill about 40110 American women in 2004, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
To be eligible for the study, women need to be between 35 and 74 years old.
Women who have not been diagnosed with breast cancer are eligible if a sister, living or dead, has had breast cancer.
The women will be tracked for 10 years so researchers can study what links the few who get breast cancer compared with the majority who do not.
Local researchers have found that radiation therapy likely no longer leaves breast cancer patients at an increased risk of potentially deadly heart disease.
A study by researchers at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center shows the risk, significant in the 1960s and 1970s, has steadily declined over the past 25 years until it is now probably gone.
"To the best of our knowledge, radiation is safe for breast cancer patients," said Dr Sharon Giordano, the study's lead author and a professor in M.D. Anderson's department of breast medical oncology.
"This is great news that should allow women to choose to have radiation without fear it could cause heart disease."
But Giordano cautioned that long term follow up is needed because the effects of radiation near the heart may not show up until 15 years after treatment.
It has not been that long for some of the patients in the study.
Giordano attributed the improvement to advances in technology and techniques that enable therapists to individualize radiation treatment, better targeting each patient's tumor.
In the past, she said, it really was "one size fits all."
Doctors have been telling patients for years that radiation is much safer than it used to be, but the study is the first to offer evidence to support the position.
The study was published in Wednesday's Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
Following surgery, close to 50 percent of women with breast cancer undergo radiation, which can cut the odds of cancer returning by two thirds.
But studies in the '60s and '70s showed radiation for breast cancer also exposed the heart in women with left sided tumors and increased their risk of heart attack and dying from heart disease.
It continued to be used because the benefit was greater than the risk.
Giordano and colleagues studied the records of more than 27000 women treated for breast cancer from 1973 to 1989 13998 with cancer in the left breast (near the heart) and 13285 with cancer in the right breast.
Of the women who underwent surgery in the 1970s, the death rate for heart disease among those with tumors on the left side was 13.1 percent.
It was 10.2 percent for those with right breast cancer.
But during the 1980s, the risk declined by 6 percent annually in women with left sided breast cancer compared with those with the disease on their right side, according to the study.
The heart disease death rate of both groups diagnosed during the decade was about 5.5 percent.
In an accompanying editorial, Dr Jack Cuzick of London's Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine said follow up is "essential" to obtain "definitive evidence" the risk has been completely eliminated.
Giordano said the team has such follow up plans.
A study examining the role childhood diet plays in breast cancer has found an association between eating French fries regularly during the preschool years and developing breast cancer as an adult.
Each weekly serving of French fries girls consumed between ages 3 and 5 increased their risk of developing breast cancer as adults by 27 percent, according to researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard School of Public Health.
The association was not found with potatoes prepared in other ways.
The finding is the first of its kind and must be confirmed by other studies, said lead author Karin Michels, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and clinical epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
"This is something nobody's really looked at before.
It's really new," she said, adding, "It could be due to chance."
She speculated the French fries may be implicated in breast cancer because they are prepared in fats that are high in harmful trans fatty acids and saturated fat.
The dietary survey examined the childhood eating habits of participants in the Harvard Nurses' Health Study.
To obtain information about what adult women had eaten as preschoolers, the researchers asked the mothers of participants in the nurses study to fill out questionnaires asking how often their daughters had eaten 30 different food items.
The researchers analyzed data gathered in 1993 from 582 participants with breast cancer and 1569 women without breast cancer.
The participants were born between 1921 and 1965, so their mothers were being asked to recall information from decades earlier.
Michels noted these recollections may have been unreliable, especially when made by mothers who already knew their daughters had breast cancer.
Consumption of whole milk was associated with a slightly decreased risk of breast cancer, though most of the milk consumed during those decades was whole milk, Michels said.
"Only one food so distinctly stood out as being associated with breast cancer risk," Michels said, and that was the french fries.
She said dietary influences may be more significant during early life than during adulthood, because the breast of a girl or infant is more susceptible to environmental influences than the breast of a mature woman.
Dr Larry Norton, deputy physician in chief of the breast cancer program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, warned against over interpreting the results.
"I wouldn't go out and change Americans' dietary habits on the basis of this, but it's certainly worth pursuing the hypothesis with additional research," he said.
Michels said her study doesn't prove that giving up French fries will protect women from breast cancer.
But with child obesity rates rising, she said, "There are numerous reasons to avoid French fries."
A form of breast cancer, which under the microscope can sometimes appear as a benign condition, actually carries a 40 year risk of flaring into invasive cancer with a capacity to spread, medical experts say.
But even with new insight into a type of breast cancer doctors call ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, there is still debate over how to treat it: Do all patients need surgery and radiation, or can some skip them?
Physicians Melinda Sanders and David Page of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Memphis, Tenn., have conducted the largest analysis to date on the form of DCIS known as low grade, which because of the appearance of the cells can be mistaken for atypical ductal hyperplasia, a benign disorder.
Sanders and Page report the results of their research in Cancer, an American Cancer Society publication.
"For a long time, people have tried to treat DCIS as one disease, but it is a spectrum that ranges from low to medium to high grade," Sanders said Monday.
She said atypical ductal hyperplasia should be closely monitored, but DCIS should be removed in most but probably not all women.
The analysis spanned 40 years to finally document "the natural history" of this low grade cancer how long it takes to develop and whether it routinely evolves into invasive breast cancer.
Sanders and Page examined specimens from 1950 to 1968 and followed the fate of the women who were diagnosed but untreated in what Sanders called the "pre mammographic era."
This made the cases especially compelling, Sanders said, because it allowed the team to determine how the disorder progresses over many decades.
Findings revealed that low grade DCIS developed into invasive cancers in 40 percent of patients with the risk extending over a 40 year period.
As a result of the new conclusions, older women may want to leave low grade DCIS untreated, Sanders said.
"This long natural history means that if this diagnosis is made in a woman 65 or 70 years old, it could be 40 years before she developed cancer."
Treatment issues involving all grades of DCIS low, medium and high have been a source of discussion for years, said Dr Daniel Budman, associate director of oncology at North Shore University Hospital.
Even geography plays a role in how women are treated, he said.
There is debate over radiation treatment and there is a difference over whether you live on the West Coast or the East Coast," Budman said.
"On the West Coast (doctors) are less likely to use radiation, on the East coast they're more likely to recommend it."
Night shift workers who had low levels of the body's vital "sleep hormone," were significantly more likely to develop breast cancer than those who were awake during the day but got plenty of shut eye at night, a team of scientists will report Wednesday.
The analysis by Boston researchers goes straight to the heart of a question scientists have asked for years: Are night shift workers, because of extended exposure to light, more likely to develop cancer?
"Two or three years ago we probably would have been reluctant to say there was an association," said Dr Eva Schernhammer, an epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
"But now the evidence is becoming clearer," that a relationship exists between tumor development and being exposed to light at night, she said.
"This study brings us one step closer to understanding why night shift workers may be more likely to develop breast cancer."
During daylight or exposure to bright lights, the hormone melatonin is suppressed.
Switch off the lights, and melatonin, secreted by the brain's pineal gland, begins to stream into the blood.
The hormone flows most copiously during sleep, thus its nickname, the sleep hormone.
A growing number of scientists theorize that melatonin also suppresses the growth of cancer cells.
Laboratory studies by researchers at the University of Arizona have shown that breast cancer cells stop proliferating in melatonin's presence.
And Dr David Blask of the Bassett Research Institute in Cooperstown found that melatonin serves as an anticancer signal to human breast cancers.
Schernhammer, who reported her results in Wednesday's Journal of the National Cancer Institute, said women exposed to light at night had measurably lower levels of a melatonin breakdown product in urine.
In her analysis, which involved participants from the Nurses Health Study, urine samples were taken from 147 nurses with invasive breast cancer and 291 matched controls who did not have the disease.
The lowest levels of melatonin's breakdown product were in night shift workers who had developed the cancer, leading Schernhammer to conclude that women with the lowest levels were 70 times more likely to develop breast cancer.
"This is an interesting bit of new information and it will be put in context with other studies that have shown similar results and those that have shown no association," said Dr Brian O'Hea, director of the Carol M. Baldwin Breast Care Center at Stony Brook University Hospital.
To further test her theory about light exposure and breast cancer, Schernhammer has embarked on a study of blind women, whose eyes aren't transmitting light to the brain.
She hypothesizes they have lower rates of breast cancer and higher levels of circulating melatonin.
Much of the improvement in breast cancer survival in recent years is because the average tumor is smaller, not just because treatments are so much better, a huge new study has found.
Examining 25 years of cancer records nationwide, researchers concluded that smaller tumor size accounted for 61 percent of the improvement in survival when cancer had not spread beyond the breast, and 28 percent when it had spread just a little.
For women 65 and older with early stage tumors the most common scenario the shift in size accounted for virtually all of the improvement in survival.
"We don't in any way want to diminish the benefits we've seen from advances in treatment because they've been enormous," said lead researcher Elena Elkin.
"But not all of the improvement in survival is due to treatment when important characteristics like size have also changed over time."
The study wasn't designed to determine the value of mammograms or treatments.
But it implies much about the value of early detection.
"This really helps to show the importance of screening," said Debbie Saslow, who heads breast cancer research at the American Cancer Society.
"In addition to finding more small tumors, we're also finding less big tumors."
Saslow had no role in the study, which was being published Monday online by the society's journal Cancer and will be in its Sept 15 print edition.
It was conducted by doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and used a federal government's database that includes nine cancer registries covering 10 percent of the U.S. population.
More than 265000 breast tumors were analyzed.
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in American women.
An estimated 211240 new cases and 40400 deaths from it are expected this year.
Survival has increased, but experts have argued over how much of that is because of better drugs or tumors being found at earlier stages.
Two thirds of breast cancers today are diagnosed at the local stage, when they're still confined to the breast, in the 1970s, only half were.
However, this is the largest study in American women to look at size within those stages.
"Even within the same stage category, the average tumor size is smaller today than it was 25 years ago," Elkin said.
For example, the number of local stage breast cancers that were smaller than 1 centimeter rose from less than 10 percent from 1975 through 1979 to 25 percent from 1995 through 1999.
An inch is about 2.5 centimeters.
Of regional stage cancers those that spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes but not widely throughout the body the portion that were smaller than 2 centimeters rose from one fifth to one third.
Next, researchers compared five year survival rates for these time periods, taking into account the shift in tumor size.
For women with local stage breast cancers, survival rose from nearly 91 percent to more than 97 percent, but was only 93 percent after adjusting for smaller tumors.
Looked at another way, the shift in size accounted for 61 percent of the improvement in survival.
For regional cancers, survival rose from about 68 percent to about 80 percent, but was only 76 percent once tumor size was factored in.
Size made a much bigger difference for older women than younger ones.
A whopping 96 percent of the survival improvement for women 65 and older with local stage cancers was explained by this.
Only 38 percent of the improvement in women under 50 was due to the shift in tumor size.
"It isn't necessarily because treatment works better for certain women, it reflects who's getting more," because younger women are more likely to receive chemotherapy, Elkin said.
It also shows that older women have benefited from mammograms, Saslow said.
Federal surveys show that the percent of women 40 and older who had a mammogram in the previous two years increased from 29 percent in 1987 to 70 percent in 2000.
The federal government recommends that women over 40 get mammograms every 1 to 2 years, with or without a breast exam by their doctor.
However, Dr Barnett Kramer, associate director for disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health, noted that the study did not have information on how many of these tumors were found through mammograms or what treatments various groups of women received, so no direct conclusions about the value of these can be drawn.
"You don't know how the cancers were diagnosed so there's no way to link any type of testing or physical examination ,with the results of this study," he said.
Attributing the benefit of smaller tumors to early detection and mammograms "makes a lot of intuitive sense, but that's of course why we do studies as opposed to depend on leaps of logic," he said.
The risk of dying from breast cancer has been falling rapidly for the past 15 years mainly because the drugs used to treat the disease have been effective at stopping the cancer from returning, according to a major new analysis.
Although surgery and radiation therapy can seem to wipe out the disease in early stage breast cancer, undetected cancer cells can remain and unleash a life threatening recurrence years later.
Studies have shown that drugs given to prevent cancer's return can improve the survival rates five years after diagnosis and that the effects last at least 10 years.
Several studies have followed women for 15 years, but no single study has been big enough to reliably show the full scope.
In a review published Friday in The Lancet medical journal, researchers led by scientists at Oxford University in England analyzed the combined evidence from 194 studies involving more than 145000 women with early stage breast cancer who were treated with drugs that were being tested during the 1980s.
They found that the benefits of these drugs are remarkably persistent 15 years after diagnosis.
The analysis found that where both chemotherapy and hormone therapy were appropriate, the risk of death within 15 years of diagnosis could be cut in half, so that if a 50 year old woman had a 1 in 5 chance of dying from her cancer, the drugs could bring the risk down to 1 in 10.
For women of any age with hormone sensitive breast cancer the most common type giving tamoxifen for five years reduced the breast cancer death rate over the next 15 years by about one third.
Dr Karen Gelmon and colleagues at the British Columbia Cancer Agency in Vancouver, who were not connected with the research, noted, however, that the review analyzed older treatment strategies and did not evaluate newer drugs that are standard therapy today.
The therapies studied in the Lancet paper have been proven, she said, but the next challenge is to cure even more women with newer and more targeted drugs.
However, the work is important in confirming the benefits over time from chemotherapy and hormone treatments, and will be reassuring to doctors and patients, she said.
The review is the fourth analysis to be conducted by the same group of scientists on the largest database of patients for any type of cancer.
About 1.15 million new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed every year worldwide.
Earlier reviews assessed the effect of various drugs on recurrence and survival over five and 10 years.
The last overview, in 2000, found that better treatments over the preceding decade had slashed breast cancer death rates in Britain and the United States by one quarter among some groups.
A cancer drug cuts in half the risk that one type of breast cancer will recur after surgery, the National Cancer Institute and the drug's manufacturer announced Monday.
Some experts said the results of two clinical trials were so strong that the drug, Genentech's Herceptin, would soon be added to chemotherapy as a standard part of postsurgical treatment for some women.
Indeed, the two trials were stopped about two years early because they had already established that Herceptin cuts recurrences and prolongs survival.
"This is a practice changing result," said Dr Edith A. Perez of the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla., the principal investigator for one of the trials.
Perez said the reduction in disease recurrence was "the largest improvement in clinical research in breast cancer in my lifetime."
The catch is that the results of the clinical trials apply only to the 20 to 30 percent of women whose breast cancer has a particular genetic mutation, because Herceptin works against such tumors only.
Herceptin is already approved as a treatment for breast cancer that has recurred after surgery or that has spread elsewhere in the body.
The two new trials were intended to look at whether the drug might also work earlier in the course of the disease, after a tumor is removed by surgery.
Various chemotherapy drugs are already used for this purpose, which is called adjuvant therapy.
For certain cancers, so are hormonal drugs like tamoxifen or the newer aromatase inhibitors.
The results of the two new trials, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, showed that Herceptin reduced recurrences by 52 percent on top of those other therapies.
After four years, only 15 percent of the women who got the drug combined with traditional chemotherapy had a relapse, compared with 33 percent of the women who got only chemotherapy, Perez said.
Other statistics from the trial were not provided.
Perez said the results would be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Orlando, Fla., next month.
Conference rules, she said, prohibit discussion of results beforehand.
The two trials, which began enrolling patients in 2000, involved a combined total of more than 5000 women, though the analysis that resulted in the trials' being stopped was based on only 3300 of them.
All were so called HER2 positive, a reference to the genetic characteristic that makes a patient a candidate for Herceptin.
All had operable cancer that in most cases had spread to the lymph nodes.
All patients were given chemotherapy and some were also given Herceptin.
Dr Clifford A. Hudis, chief of breast cancer medicine service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, called the results "big news," because using the drug in early stage treatment could have an effect on a greater number of women and perhaps help keep them free of cancer.
"It's one thing to treat a recurrent disease and it's another thing to prevent a recurrence outright," Hudis said.
"If you don't have a recurrence of breast cancer you can't die of the disease."
But he said he thought doctors should wait for the full data before deciding whether to give Herceptin to patients after surgery.
The drug can cause heart problems, and the clinical trial data should be analyzed to see how severe these side effects are, he said.
Herceptin, given intravenously, is intended to block a particular protein that juts out of tumor cells and spurs them to grow when it is activated.
The 20 to 30 percent of tumors that Herceptin is approved to treat have an abnormally high level of this protein, called HER2.
These tumors tend to be aggressive and may be less likely to be held in check by tamoxifen, doctors said, so there is a particular need for new ways to treat them.
The results are more good news for Genentech.
Use of Herceptin earlier in breast cancer will mean a bigger market for the drug, which last year had sales of $483 million.
Genentech said that 34000 women a year get adjuvant treatment for HER2 positive breast cancer in the United States.
Moreover, in the last few weeks two other trials involving another Genentech cancer drug, Avastin, were stopped early after that drug, already approved for colon cancer, was shown to work for lung cancer and breast cancer as well.
Indeed, the company, based in South San Francisco, Calif., said Monday that with demand for Avastin and Herceptin expected to grow faster than expected, it would have to review its plans to make sure it has enough manufacturing capacity.
Genentech stock has risen more than 50 percent in the last six weeks and the company is now neck and neck with the larger Amgen as the most valuable company in biotechnology, with a market capitalization of about $73 billion.
The announcement Monday came after the close of regular trading, in which Genentech's shares fell 41 cents to $69.43.
But in after hours trading the stock was up to $76.50.
Women with benign breast lesions bear a higher risk of eventually developing breast cancer, according to a study released Wednesday in the United States.
The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, gave evidence for the need for women whose biopsies of breast lesions proved benign to remain wary of the possibility that a malignancy could later develop.
"Our findings indicate a link between select types of benign breast lesions and the later development of breast cancer," said Lynn Hartmann, an oncologist with the Mayo Clinic who led the study.
"Women who have a breast biopsy that is benign must discuss the possibility of additional risks with their doctors," Hartmann said.
The Mayo team, which is examining risk factors related to breast cancer, showed after tests on 9087 women that the most common types of benign lesions, those classified as non proliferative, do not increase the risk of a susequent malignancy.
However, proliferative lesions that were benign in a biopsy were shown to have a high correlation to the later development of breast cancer.
More than one million women each year have biopsies of breast lesions that turn up benign, the report said.
Detecting the spread of breast cancer in women with large tumors may have just become easier.
Typically, surgeons remove 10 or more lymph nodes from the patient's armpit to look for the spread of cancer.
The painful operation sometimes causes swelling, numbness and infection.
But new research released this week by the University of North Carolina School of Medicine says a less invasive surgery now used with small tumors is also effective.
"There are a few individual centers using it on large tumors," said Dr David W. Ollila, a UNC surgeon and researcher.
"Now we need a national study."
Lymph node dissection is much like interviewing the eyewitnesses closest to the crime scene.
Instead of removing 10 or more lymph nodes and analyzing all of them to look for cancer, this procedure removes only the node that is closest to the cancer and most likely to have it.
If this node, called the sentinel, is clean, chances are the other nodes have not been affected.
The new study from the medical school is published in the September issue of the American Journal of Surgery.
It shows that sentinel node biopsy, when performed before chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumor, is very reliable, the UNC researchers said.
The study suggests that sentinel node biopsy is an option that might benefit all women with breast cancers, said Ollila, associate professor of surgery at UNC and a member of the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center.
"I think any woman diagnosed with breast cancer should ask her physician what role this technique might play in her overall treatment," Ollila said.
He acknowledged the controversy in medical circles about the surgery, which uses a dye injection to stain the first affected lymph node.
Dr Rosa Cuenca, a surgical oncologist at East Carolina University's Brody School of Medicine, said the procedure has been controversial for large tumors.
She compares large tumors to wrecked cars on the freeway.
When the dye used in the procedure can't get down the road, sometimes it goes around on other pathways, identifying the wrong lymph nodes.
Also, some surgeons advocate performing the sentinel node biopsy procedure in women with large tumors only after chemotherapy, to discover how much of the tumor remains.
However, results of UNC researchers show that performing the procedure before treatment provides a more accurate picture of lymph node involvement, Ollila said.
Subjects in the study were 21 breast cancer patients with tumors large enough in relation to the size of the breast that the breast could not be preserved.
Such patients usually get chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before surgery, to decrease chances of recurrence and, for a small number of women, to make it feasible to have a lumpectomy rather than a mastectomy.
In the UNC tests, researchers performed sentinel node biopsy before chemotherapy, modifying the technique slightly for larger cancers.
If the test procedure showed disease in the sentinel node or if the tumor was larger than five centimeters in diameter, all the nodes were removed and the patient received chemotherapy and surgery.
If the biopsy showed tumor free sentinel nodes and the tumor was less than five centimeters, no further lymph nodes were removed and the patient received chemotherapy and tumor removal.
In an average of 36 months of post treatment follow up, none of the patients showed progression of cancer in the lymph nodes.
The sentinel node biopsy accurately predicted node involvement, Ollila said.
Women stricken with breast cancer can boost their chances of survival by 50 percent with some exercise, according to a study published Wednesday.
"This is good news for women with breast cancer," said Doctor Michelle Holmes, a Harvard Medical School assistant professor who led the study published in the Journal of the Medical Association (JAMA).
"Women with breast cancer have little to lose and much to gain from exercise," Holmes said.
The study was conducted among some 3000 nurses diagnosed with different stages of breast cancer between 1984 1998 and who were monitored until June 2002.
The research showed that walking at an average pace for three to five hours a week reduced the risk of death by 50 percent compared to more sedentary women.
"The most logical explanation is that physical activity lowers hormone levels, and the lower hormone levels reduce the chances of a recurrence," Homes said.
"Women don't have to run marathons for the maximum benefit," she added.
Some 211000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, and 40000 die of the disease each year, the second deadliest after lung cancer.
Breast cancer patients who follow diets low in fat may reduce the chance that their tumors will return, scientists reported Monday.
It was, researchers said, the first time that a large, rigorous study showed that diet could have any impact on any cancer.
Women in the study who were assigned to follow a low fat diet had more than a 20 percent reduction in their rate of recurrence over five years, the investigators found.
Of 975 women assigned to a low fat diet, 96, or 9.8 percent, had recurrences.
But 181 of 1462 women, or 12.4 percent, who were assigned to maintain their usual diet had their cancer return.
The study's principal investigator, Dr Rowan T. Chlebowski of the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute in Torrance, Calif., described the data Monday at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Orlando.
In a telephone interview, Chlebowski explained that the women already had had the standard medical treatment lumpectomy or mastectomy followed by radiation and then hormonal therapy or chemotherapy when appropriate.
Although the treatments varied, the two groups were equivalent because the women were assigned at random to follow a low fat diet.
The additional benefit from diet, Chlebowski said, was equivalent to adding a new drug to their regimen.
"This is the first randomized clinical trial showing that diet may have an impact on breast cancer outcome, or any cancer outcome, for that matter," Chlebowski said.
But he and independent experts at the meeting and elsewhere said the study's findings, which were only marginally statistically significant, must be confirmed before recommending that women with breast cancer follow such a diet.
It is not clear, they said, what made the difference.
It could be the small amount of fat the women ate, or it could be that they lost weight.
Other studies have found that breast cancer is less likely to recur in women who lose weight after their initial treatment.
The study began in 1994 and enrolled 2437 postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer.
Of them, 975 were assigned to a diet so low in fat that, Chlebowski said, it was about as low as possible without being a vegetarian diet.
They consumed on average 33.3 grams of fat a day.
The 1462 women in the control group, who were instructed to follow their usual diet, consumed 51.3 grams of fat a day.
From the terrificpets.com discussion board came the 12 exclamation point alarm: "OMG !!
I just heard on the NEWS there may be 50000 animals LEFT BEHIND!!!!!!!!!!"
As reactions to the Katrina rescue efforts have been divided along lines of class, race and political party, they have also highlighted another schism: between dog haves and dog have nots.
Animal owners around the country have responded with outpourings of sympathy, hurt and outrage: How could rescue workers have barred pets from helicopters and shelters?
"There's been a lot of talk about this at the dog run," said Carol Vinzant, who brings her shepherd mix Jolly to the dog run in Tompkins Square Park in New York.
"They're forcing these dog owners to abandon their dogs, which in ordinary times is a crime itself.
Hundreds, maybe thousands, of people died because they did the right thing and stayed with their dogs."
Jo Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said the agency had already received more than $5.25 million for rescue efforts, along with shipments of food, blankets and other animal supplies.
Such animal generosity is nothing new.
After the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center, the ASPCA's New York branch received so many supplies that it had to stop taking donations.
Last week, as teams of rescuers combed through New Orleans on separate missions one group taking people without animals, the other taking animals without people many residents were still refusing to leave without their pets.
"When we all re evaluate this event, it may make us rethink the way we do human rescue," Sullivan said.
For Elizabeth Finch, the owner of two dogs named Zorra and Hans Blix, the sight of citizens forced to choose between their pets and their safety was, like the disaster itself, indicative of broader social rifts.
"Not to equate people with animals," she said, "but this fits into a bigger model of discrimination."
As Valerie Bennett was evacuated from a New Orleans hospital, rescuers told her there was no room in the boat for her dogs.
She pleaded.
"I offered him my wedding ring and my mom's wedding ring," the 34 year old nurse recalled Saturday.
They wouldn't budge.
She and her husband could bring only one item, and they already had a plastic tub containing the medicines her husband, a liver transplant recipient, needed to survive.
Such emotional scenes were repeated perhaps thousands of times along the Gulf Coast last week as pet owners were forced to abandon their animals in the midst of evacuation.
In one example reported last week by The Associated Press, a police officer took a dog from one little boy waiting to get on a bus in New Orleans.
"Snowball!
Snowball!" the boy cried until he vomited.
The policeman told a reporter he didn't know what would happen to the dog.
The fate of pets is a huge but underappreciated cause of anguish for storm survivors, said Richard Garfield, professor of international clinical nursing at New York's Columbia University.
"People in shelters are worried about 'Did Fluffy get out?'" he said.
"It's very distressing for people, wondering if their pets are isolated or starving."
Louisiana State Treasurer John Kennedy, who was helping with relief efforts Saturday, said some evacuees refused to leave without their pets.
"One woman told me 'I've lost my house, my job, my car and I am not turning my dog loose to starve,'" Kennedy said.
Kennedy said he persuaded refugees to get on the bus by telling them he would have the animals taken to the Lamar Dixon center in Gonzales.
The SPCA picked up two cats and 15 dogs, including one Kennedy found tied up far underneath the overpass next to an unopened can of dog food with a sign that read "Please take care of my dog, his name is Chucky".
Valerie Bennett left her dogs with an anesthesiologist who was taking care of about 30 staff members' pets on the roof of the hospital, Lindy Boggs Medical Center.
The doctor euthanized some animals at the request of their owners, who feared they would be abandoned and starve to death.
He set up a small gas chamber out of a plastic wrapped dog kennel.
"The bigger dogs were fighting it.
Fighting the gas.
It took them longer.
When I saw that, I said 'I can't do it,'" said Bennett's husband, Lorne.
But the anesthesiologist, a cat owner, promised to care for the other pets.
"He said he'd stay there as long as he possibly could," Valerie Bennett recalled, speaking from her husband's bedside at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital.
The Bennetts had four animals, including their two beloved dogs Lorne's English springer spaniel, Oreo, and Valerie's miniature dachshund, Lady.
They moved to Slidell, Louisiana, in July when Valerie took a job at an organ transplant institute connected to Lindy Boggs.
Lorne, a former paramedic, is disabled since undergoing a liver transplant in 2001.
On Saturday, as Hurricane Katrina approached, both went to the hospital to help and took all four animals with them.
Patients were evacuated starting Monday by rescue workers using small boats to traverse the floodwaters surrounding the hospital.
On Wednesday night, the Bennetts were told they had to go, too.
They fed their guinea pig and left it in its cage in a patient room.
They couldn't refill its empty water bottle because the hospital's plumbing failed Sunday, they said.
They poured food on the floor for the cat, but again no water.
"I just hope that they forgive me," Valerie Bennett cried.
They handed the dogs to the anesthesiologist.
Valerie got his last name but no cell phone number.
"I wasn't thinking," she said.
But on Saturday afternoon, Valerie Bennett said she saw a posting on a Web site called petfinder.com that said the anesthesiologist was still at Lindy Boggs caring for the animals.
Molly was stranded in the floodwaters that submerged New Orleans East.
So was her blind owner.
But when rescue workers airlifted the owner last week, Molly, a black Labrador seeing eye dog, was left behind.
Five days passed, said Laura Maloney, director of the Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, before the New Orleans police, National Guard soldiers and a man named Joe with a boat found their way to the house.
An animal control officer in waders stepped into water that still rose halfway up the first floor, and she climbed the stairs.
"She saw a black nose peeking around the corner," said Maloneywhose office also handles animal control for the city.
"It was the petrified dog.
She was very thin."
Within 24 hours dog and owner were reunited in Lake Charles, La.
But Maloney say endings as happy as this have been frustratingly rare so far.
Out of at least 3000 cats and dogs and several hundred birds, reptiles and other exotic pets recovered so far, only 300 to 400 have been reunited with their owners since the storm, she said.
The society is beginning to post photographs of the animals on a Web site, petfinder.com, which has created a section about animals in Hurricane Katrina.
The society is keeping an average of about 2000 animals at the Lamar Dixon Center in Gonzalez, La., flying or driving about 500 to Houston and other places every other day.
Maloney said the center received at least 700 animals on Monday alone.
The center is also housing about 400 horses, as well as animals that until two weeks ago worked pulling tourists through town.
"The French Quarter mules are at our facility," Maloney said.
She noted the large feral cat population in New Orleans.
Rail thin kittens lurk in yards in muddy neighborhoods by day and dart away when car headlights disrupt the darkness over the city at night.
Maloney estimated that tens of thousands of animals remained in the city and said that her group was conducting "food missions" on Tuesday, leaving food at various points for animals they cannot yet rescue.
The society has been frustrated by outside groups, however well intentioned, that have come to the region, sometimes taking animals back to shelters in other places without registering their work with the society.
Maloney said those rescues left "no opportunity to reunite owners with pets."
She emphasized that many outside groups were using the society's registration system, including the Humane Society of the United States and a large group from Broward County, Fla., which is running the shelter operations at Lamar Dixon.
Maloney attends daily emergency management briefings with military, police and city officials, always carrying a laminated map, made by Louisiana State University using global positioning satellite software, that pinpoints addresses where owners have said their pets may be.
The animal rescue team has come back for Nike the cat.
Tramping through the debris left by Hurricane Katrina around the white clapboard house, they see his fresh prints in the dark brown mud.
They'll return with a trap, trying to coax him in with a can of Friskies.
If things go well, he'll soon join Danny, the poodle mix dog, at an animal shelter in Hattiesburg, Miss., about 80 miles away.
Eventually, they'll be reunited with their person, Rebecca Kutos .
She's in Rome, Ga., at her sister's house, trying to sort out her life after the hurricane destroyed her home, her car and the Isle of Capri casino in Biloxi, Miss., where she was a dealer.
Finding Kutos took a bit of detective work just part of the job description of a dedicated group of volunteers and professionals from several states working under the auspices of the Humane Society of the United States in this storm ravaged area.
Since the first handful of workers arrived immediately after Katrina, an escalating effort has rescued more than 100 animals.
Among them, besides the usual variety of breeds of dogs and cats, are six horses, an iguana, a hybrid bobcat and even Callie, a sea lion from Marine Life in Gulfport.
Some animals have been surrendered by their owners, who can't care for them in the storm's aftermath.
If the owners agree, they'll be put up for adoption.
Strays or displaced pets are usually reported by search and rescue teams, law enforcement officers, clean up and restoration workers, or neighbors.
They're being housed in Hattiesburg for 30 days to give their owners a chance to find them.
In one Biloxi home at week's end, the animal searchers found five dogs alive, but some discoveries have been grim.
At another Biloxi home, where neighbors said no one had been for 10 days, a team found six kennel crates with dead pit bulls inside.
Judy Roe, a Gulf Coast search and rescue worker going door to door with search dogs in Pass Christian to find human beings found Danny and got a glimpse of Nike.
Thompson Poirrier and her team took Danny to be evaluated and housed temporarily in an $80000 state of the art trailer owned by Humane Society volunteer Ronnie Graves of Bushnell, Fla. Graves, who has a prosthetic leg because of a train accident, is in the prosthetics business for humans and animals.
He bought the trailer and rig and outfitted it with a generator, washer/dryer, portable toilet and shower, freezer and barbecue range.
The Humane Society furnished the kennels.
Graves saw the need during animal rescue efforts in Florida after Hurricane Charlie last year.
He had it ready to hit the road at the beginning of this year's hurricane season.
When Thompson Poirrier had a chance to examine the envelope in her pocket, she called her ex husband, who traced the Louisiana address.
A sheriff's deputy left a message at the house.
A man called to tell Thompson Poirrier how to reach Kutos.
She was ecstatic at the news.
Volunteers say stories like that help answer the question they've all heard why spend time and money on animals when humans are in dire straits?
Helping animals helps people, explained Sheri Evans of Sumter County, Fla., who's overseeing the intake process.
"We want to take care of animals to help their people get back on their feet," Evans said.
Hearing that Danny is safe and that Nike has been sighted gave Kutos a boost after her harrowing hurricane experience.
Hours after they were trapped in the attic by Hurricane Katrina's rising water, she and her sister, Laurie Moody, saw hope in an approaching Coast Guard helicopter.
Kutos ran to the window, waving a flashlight.
A Coast Guardsman came down, broke through the roof, and boosted them upward in a wire basket, one by one.
Danny and Nike were left behind.
After spending the night at a Coast Guard facility, they took a taxi to the Mobile, Ala., airport, rented a car and went to Rome to be with their sister, Abigail Pontiff.
They still wore their filthy clothes.
Kutos had only her wallet.
Hearing that Danny has been rescued and Nike has been seen is "like a miracle," she said.
"I had such a guilty feeling about leaving them up there alone.
There's no way to accept something like that."
As for the card Thompson Poirrier picked up, it had pictures of cats on the front.
On the back was an insignia from the Humane Society of the United States.

Sometimes when the helicopters and military vehicles go quiet in New Orleans, you can hear the howls and screams of the hordes of dogs and cats still trapped in homes and on rooftops.
"It's scary," said Willie Cirone, a volunteer from New Jersey who came to the stricken city to rescue animals after Hurricane Katrina.
"There are hundreds of them in houses still."
About 20 volunteers tour the city in a convoy of trucks on the few passable roads.
Some have small boats to go into the floods.
Some of the volunteers have brought fishermen's gear so they can wade through the streets, carrying dog leashes in their hands.
They have come across terrified mongrels, a Pitbull that nearly strangled itself on a leash before collapsing with exhaustion.
"They are scared, they are hungry, they are tired," said Kerry Branon of the International Federation for Animal Welfare.
The address where an animal is found is noted, in case it can be reunited with the owner.
But most of the rescued animals are still waiting in a huge agricultural exhibition hall at Gonzales, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from New Orleans.
There are already about 1300 dogs, cats, rabbits, parrots and more.
"About 400 get here every evening.
Only about 20 people a day find their pets here," said Laura Maloney, executive director of the Louisiana Society for the Protection of Animals (SPCA).
Exhausted human refugees tour the building.
Some carry photos of their lost animals, some have put up signs offering a reward for their pets.
Summer Johannesson, a 23 year old fashion student from Florida, and some friends came to volunteer at the shelter after the killer storm.
She accompanied a distraught woman who had lost her cat and fell into tears every time she tried to describe it.
A sign warns everyone: "Please be cautious next to the cages of animals that are not yours.
They are stressed and can be defensive."
Dori Mayard, a 42 year old nurse, brought her dogs to the shelter.
She managed to get them out of New Orleans before her house was flooded but cannot keep them in the two room apartment where she is now staying with nine relatives.
Some owners have got past the military checkpoints to re enter the city to try to find their animals.
Others have not been so lucky.
Elizabeth Whitlock tried to get back into New Orleans to find her 28 month old cat, Carmine, but was turned back, brutally she thought.
"Yesterday we were five blocks away from my place when we had to turn back.
Only five blocks!" she said.
"We tried every side road.
We were blocked by the sheriff.
I begged, I pleaded, I would have offered them money, I even showed them the pictures, but there was no way.
"My neighborhood is perfectly dry, but they won't let anybody through.
The sheriff told me 'You should have grabbed him when you had the chance'," she said, sobbing.
"They turned me away at gunpoint.
They told me not today, not tomorrow, not for weeks."
Whitlock, manager of Faulkner House Books, which has the world's biggest collection of first edition books by William Faulkner, said she had left enough food for Carmine to survive about a week.
"But it's the water I'm concerned about.
I didn't leave the toilet seat up because they warned us the sewers could overflow due to the storm.
I bolted all the windows, I put special hurricane shutters on.
"He is my baby.
He's bred like some dogs who are capable to bond with humans intensely."
Emergency officials say the pet toll could be as bad as the human one.
Four kittens floating on a broken door.
A German Shepard loose on the interstate.
And a 90 kilo (200 pound) potbellied pig tied to a fence.
Those were just a few of the animals that Willie Cirone and his partner Jeff Eyre rescued from the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina.
The Humane Society volunteers sped though New Orleans answering calls from evacuees who left their pets behind, and rescue workers who found them in the floodwaters.
The truck was surrounded when it pulled onto a street filled with rescue workers searching flooded houses for survivors.
"I got four kittens I rescued today," one firefighter called out as he dashed past the boats to a dry spot where he'd left the mewling grey kittens.
Three others brought dogs over, including Tim Robson, who'd spotted a beagle in a window and smashed it open to get the dog out.
"How can people leave them," wondered Robson, a firefighter from New Mexico who owns a dog and a goldfish.
"I'd much rather see a person in a house than an animal because an animal can't do anything for itself."
Thousands of people were forced to leave their pets behind when they evacuated New Orleans.
Most expected to be home in a few days.
But with nearly 80 percent of the city buried under disease ridden floodwaters, officials said they won't be able to get back to their homes for months.
Even to get their pets.
The Humane Society and SPCA are doing their best to rescue animals trapped in sweltering homes for more than a week.
Getting them all will be impossible.
"You can only take as many dogs as you have people to take care of them," Cirone said.
"It's a massive operation."
Cirone and Eyre spent nearly two hours Tuesday clearing a house filled with 22 cats, two dogs and a bird.
Healthy animals roaming the street are left to fend for themselves so the animal protection crews can focus on saving those trapped in homes with no way to scavenge for food.
It's exhausting work.
But the worst part isn't the animals.
It's the people.
"You've got to walk through bodies to get animals," Cirone said.
"Some were in the water.
Some were on their porch."
The burly firefighter and animal control officer from New Jersey said he tries his best to tune out the misery around him and to focus on getting his job done.
But there are moments when it slips through.
Like when a small boy and his mother dropped off their pet rabbit and mice.
"All their possessions were in a Volkswagen Beatle.
That's all they have left."
The animals are being cared for at a farm north of Louisiana until they can be reunited with their families, many of whom were told they would not be able to bring their pets on evacuation busses and helicopters.
Photographs of some animals are being posted on a website, petfinder.com, so their owners can claim them.
Soldiers assigned to rescue survivors of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans are turning their attention to saving pets as the number of people being plucked to safety dwindles.
"Our focus so far is on people but ,there is a lot of focus and concerns of a lot of people who left their animals or became separated from them," said Lieutenant General Russel Honore, the commander of the Katrina rescue operation here.
"We've got the capacity, it seemed like the right thing to do," he told reporters in the Louisiana capital of Baton Rouge.
Animal rescue officials have been collecting scores of pets and other animals from the shattered city, while many survivors have told of their distress at having to leave beloved cats and dogs behind in the watery city when they fled.
The tens of thousands of troops that have secured the city are completing their operation to rescue stranded victims and are now focusing on evacuating remaining residents and receiving bodies, Honore said.
Animal lovers across the country are mobilizing to help thousands of pets and farm animals still stranded or left homeless by Hurricane Katrina and the floods that followed.
Wayne Pacelle, president and chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States, appealed Wednesday for immediate federal, state and local assistance in the Gulf Coast area to save animals he said will die in the next few days if they aren't found, fed and sheltered.
"Animals are trapped by the thousands in their homes, and the clock is ticking," he said.
"We need the government to help us, not with money but with rescuers.
We need the Coast Guard, firemen and the National Guard,We'll take care of the animals after they are pulled out."
Pacelle, noting that about 60 percent of households have pets, estimated that more than 50000 animals might be in peril.
His organization has received more than 2000 calls from people who fled Katrina.
Other organizations, including the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, also have been getting pleas for help.
Many people left behind pets, especially cats, because they thought they would be gone only a couple of days.
Hundreds of animal welfare workers and volunteers are in Louisiana and Mississippi with mobile veterinary units, vans, boats, pet food and supplies, as well as holding pens for farm animals.
The most crucial mission is the door to door rescue of the stranded pets, but officials said there also is a pressing need to ease the strain on crowded animal shelters and get pet food to those who have taken in stray animals until they can be reunited with their owners.
Several animal welfare groups are using their Web sites to help reunite owners with their pets and to solicit contributions to assist with their rescue efforts.
Many people who were trapped in their homes by Katrina said they chose to stay rather than leave without beloved pets.
Animal rescue workers said Wednesday that they are trying to find more shelters that will allow the people and pets to remain together.
"Some of these people will live on the streets and won't go to a shelter if they have to be separated from their pets," said Laura Bevan, the Humane Society's southeast regional director.
"I respect that, because I wouldn't either."
New Orleans A thoroughfare in New Orleans that ends where the water begins has become a launching point for rescue workers and for residents looking for anything left behind especially pets.
After Hurricane Katrina's devastation hit, residents walked along Veterans Memorial Boulevard into New Orleans from neighboring Jefferson Parish only to be stopped by flood waters lapping the street where it dips lower.
Homes on both sides of the ramp and as far as residents could see were flooded up to the eaves last week.
Almost all other access points into New Orleans have been blocked by military soldiers or are being used as launching points for official search and rescue crews.
Search crews and ambulances gathered at Veterans Memorial Boulevard to save anyone still stuck in the flooded city.
But some residents brought hopes of finding pets, while others wanted to reclaim anything that would allow them to move forward with their lives.
Others just stood there and cried.
"My son's house, my mother's house, our first house are all in there," said one sobbing woman who wanted to remain anonymous.
"Anything but this water we could deal with.
This water is unforgivable.
The lives this is going to ruin ," The street was littered with water bottles, old clothing and other trash washed up by the water, which has receded in recent days.
A toy shark lay in the median in grass that became mud closer to the water.
Most were disappointed by what they found or could not even get to their homes.
Others were luckier, able to retrieve clothing, and one woman walked away with her two rescued cats.
Throughout last week, trucks backed down the boulevard, dropping motorboats, paddleboats and even jet skis into the water.
Those without boats asked for rides, trading gallons of gas or cash for rides to their homes.
Others just "borrowed" boats left behind.
After asking a few people for rides, Robert Krowl took the motor off a boat and paddled to his home.
He was desperate to get to Snoopy, his 4 year old Dachshund, and Boots, a 12 year old cat.
"I would gladly give money to anyone to help get my pets," he said.
"I put food for them on the bottom floor.
I didn't think the water would get that high.
I thought we'd be back in five or six days."
More than an hour later, Krowl returned to the landing without his beloved dog and cat.
He was near tears.
"I just couldn't get close enough," he said.
Downed power lines and trees blocked passage to the house.
As he left, others were getting into the water.
They sought remnants of anything that could help them get on with their lives.
For Matt Kerrigan and Todd Musgrave, that meant going in for their suits so they could begin to work again.
After climbing into a second story window, Musgrave also retrieved birth certificates and other clothing from his Lakeview home, then still submerged in 4 feet of water.
A large wooden swing set in his backyard was turned upside down on the house.
Richard LeBanc and Mike Goodrich brought many of the stranded to safety at the landing during the first several days after the storm.
The pair did not evacuate, living in the top floor of a neighbor's house since Katrina hit.
But over the weekend the pair decided to give it up and join those living on dry land.
"We're sick, it's time to go," LeBanc said.
"We can't go back out, it smells like sewage.
We are both getting sick."
While the odds were often against those who got on boats looking for lost animals, they came anyway.
The risk paid off for one woman.
Ellen White broke out in tears when her friend Bob Lewis returned to the landing in a boat, her two cats cradled in his arms wrapped in towels.
Domino and Destiny were found on furniture, Domino on a floating bookshelf in the living room looking out the window and Destiny in the bedroom on a floating mattress.
The house still had 5 feet of water.
"I had them on Science Diet Light because they were getting fat, but I guess it was a good thing they were fat," she said through her tears.
"This was the only reason to come back."
They cruise through flooded or muddy streets, scanning porches, backyards and windows for hungry animals left stranded by Hurricane Katrina.
"It's very sad ,it is overwhelming," said SPCA Los Angeles spokeswoman Dawn Cotterell, via cell phone from Jefferson Parish, La., as she and a dozen members of her Disaster Animal Response Team hunted for lost pets.
"We have seen dogs chained on porches, tied up in backyards, starving.
Many of them are pretty thin, you can see their ribs.
It breaks my heart."
The Samaritans from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Los Angeles, are among many Southern California residents who have raced against time to aid pets along the ravaged Gulf Coast.
They have scouted waterlogged neighborhoods.
Fed stray animals.
Manned temporary shelters.
Found foster homes.
And attempted to unite family pets with owners scattered from Texas to the Canadian border.
Volunteers work from dawn till dusk, bedding down for the night in tents and rented cars.
In the next few weeks, SPCA Los Angeles plans to airlift 300 homeless dogs from Hurricane Katrina from Houston to Los Angeles for foster care or permanent homes.
Amanda St. John, founder of MuttShack.org, said her rescue group has shipped more than 250 dog crates to Baton Rouge and New Orleans and rescued 40 dogs a day from within the devastated city.
The Lake View Terrace resident will fly to Louisiana today to coordinate rescue operations for 40 volunteers to save the pooches.
"We're camping out, we have groups in RVs, we're sleeping in cars.
We're just trying to save the dogs and cats and the tarantulas," said St. John, 49, who grew to love animals on the savanna in her native Zululand in South Africa.
"I got an e mail yesterday saying, 'My pot bellied pig is in my backyard, please rescue him.'
If need be, I will be wading in the water."
Hollywood celebs have even jumped into the act, with public pleas for pet relief.
"I am haunted, worse than you will ever know," said Gretchen Wyler, vice president of the Humane Society of the United States, Hollywood, based in Encino, who recruited such celebrities as Sean Aston and Bill Maher for TV spots.
"Everyone in America knows that these aren't something that wags its tail they're members of people's families."
On Sunday, state and federal officials permitted more than 3000 dogs at a full HSUS/SPCA temporary shelter in Gonzales, La., to begin relocating to other states.
That means more room for the dozens of pets rescued daily from New Orleans that need aid.
The Humane Society, which has a disaster team of 200 rescuers on the Gulf Coast, is looking to open a second shelter near Gonzales to cope with the overflow.
The HSUS and other groups have rescued nearly 4000 animals from Louisiana and Mississippi, with 200 reunited with their owners.
Petfinder.com is posting photos of the lost Katrina pets.
Before they are shipped to other shelters, each pet will be photographed, microchipped and documented.
"This is a massive undertaking," said Wayne Pacelle, president and chief executive officer of the Humane Society, in a statement.
"People who have lost everything are holding on to their last hope that their pets will be saved."
They limped into Los Angeles on Friday animal saviors from Hurricane Katrina beset by a journey of flat tires and big rig pile ups.
And dozens of half starved dogs and cats.
The caravan of barking dogs was met by a Hollywood reception of B actresses and animal doters on hand to give them L.A. hugs and foster care.
"Poochy poochy poochy pooh," cooed Deborah Bass of Simi Valley, wagging the paws of Stormy, a black cockapoo rescued this week from New Orleans' 9th Ward.
"We are incredibly blessed to be able to help."
Bass, co founder of Bichons and Buddies animal rescue, had joined Rescue for Ruffugees II 10 rescue groups and more than 60 mostly women volunteers to triage, treat and take in 35 four legged foster pets.
Each will be kept a month before being put up for adoption to allow for a possible reunion with its owners, who are being sought via the Internet.
As a New Leash on Life Emergency Rescue Team unloaded its cargo at a Van Nuys Airport hangar, the reception committee turned to mush at the site of 30 suffering pooches and five skinny kitties.
"This is very hard," said Danielle Nicolet of Studio City, an actress who lives in New Orleans part of the year.
"A lot of my friends lost their dogs ,I'm here to help the doggies."
The animals followed the 232 dogs and 13 cats now in Los Angeles foster homes or shelters as a result of Hurricane Katrina.
The event, hosted by the New Leash on Life of Santa Clarita and Much Love Animal Rescue, could well be the last.
There were thin German shepherds.
Frowzy haired terriers.
Beagles with sores.
Pomeranians with mouth tumors.
And limping mutts that had nails pulled from their paws.
There were also prancing chows.
Sprightly pit bulls.
And springer spaniels willing to lick the faces of strangers.
Like other Katrina rescues, more than half of the dogs and cats were believed to have contracted heartworm and other parasites.
They had endured toxic floods and had little to eat but garbage and carrion.
"We found them in houses, in closets, locked in bathrooms, under beds.
A lot of them running in packs on the streets we couldn't catch," said Jane Rosner, 49, of Calabasas, one of 22 volunteers to join Bobby Dorafshar and his New Leash rescue team in New Orleans.
"Some came in happy, wagging their tails 'Oh, my God, I'm so happy to be here,"' said Karen Betzold, 39, of Glendale, another rescue team volunteer.
"Some came in sad 'I just want to go back in my cage.'
Some came in aggressive 'Get the hell away from me, I've had enough.
I'm hungry.
I'm scared."'
En route to Los Angeles, a caravan of five trucks and vans suffered one accident with a semi, two flat tires, one dead battery, and one air conditioner failure for the dogs and cats.
Each animal was welcomed Friday at various stations to be photographed, microchipped and medically treated before going to its foster home.
A listing for each pet will be posted on the Internet one month before it is available locally for adoption.
"It was important that they get out of Louisiana, because they're dying where they stand," said Kim Finger, director of Rescue for Ruffugees, which took in a planeload of 93 dogs and 13 cats last month.
"We have a lot of rescue groups in Los Angeles willing to open up their facilities and houses to these pets."
The SPCA LA, which took in the first flight of dogs and cats last month from the hurricane stricken area, said more than half of its 118 dogs and seven cats are in foster homes through December and the remainder are in area shelters.
One dog was reunited last week with a single mother and her son from New Orleans.
"We were all crying," said Madeline Bernstein, president of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Los Angeles.
"We feel great to be able to help these animals out."

Cheryl Landry sobbed as she tied Napi to a pole on the hospital's roof and repeatedly told her little dog goodbye.
She wrote two cellphone numbers on a white hospital band and secured it around the dog's neck.
"Napi Witland belongs to Cheryl Landry, RN," it read.
Then Landry boarded a boat with her husband and daughter and, after four days of dealing with death and despair, sped away from New Orleans' Lindy Boggs Medical Center and her beloved 2 year old pug.
Anesthesiologist James Riopelle, armed with a stash of morphine, had told his co workers at the hospital that he would stay behind and take care of about 65 pets, including a couple of guinea pigs, for as long as it was safe.
If it became necessary, he would euthanize the animals rather than let them drown in the rising floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina in the hospital.
"I'm thinking that Napi was dead," Landry said.
"I thought they had euthanized her."
But then she got a phone call she thought would never come: Napi was alive and well in the small town of Aledo, Texas, 20 miles west of Fort Worth.
On Tuesday, in a reunion that brought bystanders to tears, Napi finally after three long weeks found her way back into Landry's arms.
As the storm approached New Orleans on Aug 28, Cheryl Landry persuaded her usually storm stubborn husband, Larry, to ride it out at the hospital, where she worked as a nurse and her daughter worked as a medical secretary.
Napi went too, joining dozens of other pets brought there by the hospital staff and patients.
After Katrina struck and the power went out and the water began to rise things went from bad to horrific at Lindy Boggs.
Over the next few days, the hospital staff worked tirelessly in the sweltering heat to care for patients, fanning them with cardboard boxes and rationing food, water and medicine.
Many patients died.
At one point, Larry Landry helped carry the bodies through the dark building to a makeshift morgue on the second floor.
"What we saw in the hospital was not normal," Cheryl Landry said.
"There was nothing that we could do to care for these people.
We did the best that we could with what we had."
Several days later, a fleet of boats finally arrived to begin evacuating patients and staff.
That's when Cheryl Landry said she was told she could not take Napi.
"I didn't want to leave without my dog," she said.
"The hospital administrator came and said, 'You can't.
You have to leave her.'
I couldn't fathom the idea of leaving her, that was like my child."
Landry said she tried to sneak Napi out in a bag.
Her husband, feeling his wife's desperation, begged a hospital security guard to try to save their dog.
The guard said he couldn't.
"Meanwhile, she (Cheryl) is just going hysterical," Larry Landry said.
Cheryl Landry took Napi up to the roof with the other workers' pets, where a dog run had been created, tied her down and sobbed.
"At that time, we had evacuated just about all of the patients," she said.
"I think we had about nine left, and those patients weren't movable.
"At that time, everybody was so distraught.
Family members were crying inside, and I had to go.
They were begging me to hurry up.
My daughter grabbed my hand and told me to come on."
Landry said that boats carried them to a causeway under the Interstate 10 bridge, where they waited with thousand of others.
"I get out of there in the crowd of people and I see all of these people with their animals," she said.
"I felt so guilty."
From there, they boarded a school bus that carried them to a shelter in Lafayette, La.
The next day, they rented a car and drove to Baltimore, where Cheryl Landry's family lives.
Napi never left her thoughts.
"I cried from that point on," Landry said.
"All I could think about was the things she used to do you know, peep around the corner at me.
Everywhere I move, all I hear is her little feet clicking."
She didn't know that Tenet Healthcare Corporation, which owns Lindy Boggs Medical Center, had arranged to have helicopters and boats evacuate the workers' pets from the hospital.
The animals were taken to Slidell, La., and then bused to an airport in Hattiesburg, Miss.
There, four people from the Aledo Vet Clinic Kent Glenn, Janine Theal, C.J. Bishop and Susan Hill set up a triage center, where they treated the pets, which for the most part were mostly just hungry and dehydrated.
Only one of the animals, a cat, had to be euthanized.
The team then loaded the animals and drove them to Texas, arriving on Sept 6.
The pets were placed with foster families until they could be reunited with their owners.
"It's a blessing to give these people back their pets," Theal said.
"For some, it's the one thing they have left."
Mary Lou Finsterwald, a second grade teacher in Aledo and animal lover, took Napi home and instantly fell in love.
"She is a wonderful dog," Finsterwald said.
The next day, Finsterwald called the numbers on the hospital band around Napi's neck.
Landry was sitting on her sister's porch in Baltimore when the phone rang.
"Mary Lou introduced herself and asked me if I had a dog," Landry recalled.
"I said, 'Yes,' and she said, "Well, I have Napi.'
"I hollered!"
The Landrys said Finsterwald told her how Napi had been rescued and assured them that she was fine.
"That was the greatest moment of our lives," Larry Landry said.
"She said, 'Do what you have to do, take your time, she'll be ready when y'all are ready for her.'
" Landry said that she and her husband began making arrangements to drive to Texas to get Napi.
On Sunday, after deciding they couldn't wait any longer, they loaded up and "put the pedal to the metal," Cheryl Landry said.
Tuesday morning, the couple walked into the Aledo Vet Clinic, where they had agreed to meet Finsterwald.
They cried and hugged and pumped the hands of the staff who were instrumental in bringing their family back together.
Then, Finsterwald walked in carrying their dog.
"Napi!
Napi!" the Landrys cried, scooping up their pet as customers in the waiting room began wiping away tears.
Napi, wearing a hot pink collar, began crawling all over the Landrys and quickly began making up for three weeks of lost kisses.
"It's a definite miracle," Cheryl Landry said. "
My thoughts were that I would never see her again."
After Finsterwald gave them a scrapbook filled with photos of Napi taken over the last few weeks and that now tattered hospital band, the couple got on the road with Napi and pointed their car toward New Orleans.
They plan to try to return home to retrieve photos and some valuables before heading back to Maryland to start a new life.
"This is the grand finale right here," Larry Landry said.
"Thank you."

The images left an indelible mark on the American conscience: man's best friend wandering the abandoned streets of New Orleans or stranded atop the city's flooded houses.
But the plight of pets in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina did more than just soften the hearts of the nation's animal lovers it opened their wallets.
Tens of millions of dollars an unprecedented amount compared with other disasters, animal welfare advocates say poured into pet charities such as the Humane Society, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, PetSmart Charities and Noah's Wish, a group whose sole purpose is to save animals during disasters.
"The images were compelling," said Wayne Pacelle, president and chief executive officer for the Humane Society of the United States.
"It was gut wrenching for people to see pets being taken away from their owners as they were being evacuated."
The overwhelming majority of post hurricane recovery and relief funds went to help people, said Katya Andresen, vice president of marketing for Network For Good, the nation's largest clearinghouse for online charitable giving.
She noted that $1.3 billion of the $2 billion raised so far for Katrina relief went to the Red Cross, primarily through the Red Cross Web site, phone lines and direct mail campaign.
Likewise, Red Cross was the top recipient of Katrina relief donations through Network For Good, with $7.5 million.
But four others in the top 10 specialize in animal assistance.
"One of the things that got a lot of (media) coverage was people having to leave their pets behind," Andresen said.
"People really connected with that part of the story and those images."
In contrast, she said, "The last big disaster was tsunami, and pets were not part of that story."
Donations reflected that.
Among the animal welfare organizations that took in the most post hurricane money were the Humane Society, with $20 million in donations, Noah's Wish, with $6.5 million, and PetSmart Charities, with $3.5 million.
Much of the money has paid or will pay for food, medical attention and vaccines, sheltering pets and reuniting them with owners, and rebuilding damaged animal shelters in Louisiana.
"People to a great extent can take care of themselves.
They can ask for help or use their cell phones, and animals cannot do that," said Terri Crisp, founder and director of Noah's Wish.
"People's hearts go out to them more because they are helpless."
At the Web site www.networkforgood.org, donors can search for nonprofit groups by the type of charitable work they do, then make contributions online.
Donors for Katrina relief gave to more than 300 organizations through Network For Good, Andresen said.
On that list, the Humane Society (with $309000 in gifts) ranked behind Red Cross, Salvation Army and Catholic Charities USA, but ahead of Habitat for Humanity (with $264000 in gifts).
Animal advocacy groups said the level of giving to pet charities does not mean the donors value pets above people.
Rather, they said, this disaster showed the close relationship between humans and animals.
"People who gave felt the animals were related to people and wanted them to be OK," said Linda Lampkin, director for the Urban Institute's National Center for Charitable Statistics.
Pacelle, of the Humane Society, said having to choose between humans and pets is "a false choice.
A lot of people gave to both."
"There's a misconception that there's a finite amount of compassion," Pacelle said.
"People donated toward the human and animal victim."
Indeed, Andresen said Network For Good reported many people giving to more than one organization one that would help people and another that would help people's furry friends.
"Noah's Wish exists as much to help people as animals," added Crisp, explaining that the group has sheltered families, taken care of their pets free of charge and reunited pets with families.
"We're not taking away from anything by being here to take care of the animal needs.
If we weren't here, there would be a large percentage of animals that wouldn't have survived (the hurricane and its ensuing flood), and that would've been a huge loss for people."
Aside from donations, animal advocacy groups said the dramatic post disaster period opened up a window for them to educate the public about the importance of having a disaster plan for pets.
Said Pacelle, "People will never see animals in disaster in the same way."
After watching Hurricane Katrina's devastation from their Port Arthur, Texas, home, the Myers family made evacuation plans.
If ever they were forced to flee, the family would head to Marshall, in East Texas, where relatives would be waiting, Michael Myers said.
The men would go early one weekend and build a shelter for their dogs.
They ran out of time.
"We had a family meeting before Rita was a thunderstorm," Michael Myers said.
"We wanted to keep everyone together.
But Rita came so fast we weren't able to put that plan into motion."
The Myerses were luckier than many others.
They contacted kennel owner and animal lover Don Praeger in Arlington, Texas, who agreed to shelter their pets and those of other hurricane victims for free.
But many hurricane evacuees are still waiting to be reunited with their animals.
Thousands are being steered to Petfinder.com, a Web site updated daily with photographs of lost pets.
Nearly 8000 animals have been rescued from storm ravaged areas, said James Bias, president of the Texas Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
"We're still finding some animals alive," Bias said.
"Unfortunately, we're also finding many animals that have died."
The Louisiana staging area where many rescued animals have been kept since Katrina struck is being shut down, and owners have until Oct 15 to claim their animals from that site before they are put up for adoption, Bias said.
"That's not to say that you need to pick up the animal, but you need to be connected to the animal," Bias said.
To help return pets to their owners, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Humane Society of the United States have established a fund to help pay transportation and other costs, said Karen Medicus, ASPCA project director based in Austin.
The two organizations will do "whatever it takes to get the animal back to their owners," Medicus said.
Animals have been shipped from Louisiana to different parts of the country and placed in animal shelters and foster homes until their owners can make provisions for them.
Listing lost pets on Petfinder beyond Dec 15 is unrealistic, some experts said.
"We've had a few really sad situations where people have had to release their pets to us because they have nothing left," said Angie Sprott, spokeswoman for the Humane Society of North Texas in Fort Worth.
Michael Myers and his 16 year old son are doing what they can to repay Praeger's kindness.
Each morning, they drive to Country Acres Kennel to help with cleaning and other odd jobs.
"I needed that help.
I couldn't afford to pay the money that they would normally charge," Myers said.
"I wanted to give him something back to show him how appreciative I was."
Myers said a neighbor told him his house in Port Arthur is in pretty decent shape.
He said he plans to take his family back sometime this week.
Those seeking animals lost in the storm are being routed to www.petfinder.com, an Internet clearing site containing pictures, descriptions and locations of lost pets.
Other resources: The Humane Society of the United States and the ASPCA will reimburse approved shelters the cost of transporting animals to their owners, up to $400.
For help grieving the death of a pet or for support after being separated from a pet, call the ASPCA's Pet Loss Hotline at (800) 946 4646, enter PIN 140 7211 and leave a telephone number.
A volunteer will return the page.

A Virginia prison has become a refuge for about two dozen cats displaced by Hurricane Katrina, a place where female inmates are happy to be able to soothe away the felines' trauma and fear.
Four Pocahontas Correctional Unit inmates have been caring for the cats since they made the cramped 20 hour truck ride last month from an overwhelmed Mississippi shelter.
The women see it as a chance to help not only the abandoned pets, but also the hurricane relief effort and even themselves.
"They've had a long journey," said inmate Wendy Brickey, 45, her eyes brimming with tears.
"I get the chance to make it OK."
The prison's Pen Pals program, in which trusted inmates help socialize abandoned cats until they're ready for adoption, had just five felines before Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast.
The Humane Society of the United States estimates as many as 50000 animals may have been left behind in the New Orleans area alone.
An animal shelter in Mississippi took Pen Pals cat coordinator Peggy Lynch up on her offer to help rehabilitate some of the cats it had taken in.
A feeling of serenity permeates the prison's shelter, a squat, maroon building just outside the barbed wire fence.
Pictures of cats plaster the cinderblock walls and cat print curtains and pillows brighten the otherwise drab room.
"It's probably the nicest shelter that they could ever land in, so far as the amount of love and attention," Lynch said.
The animals arrived agitated and scared, many suffering from respiratory illnesses due to the stress of a long truck ride in a plastic carrier and weeks in a cramped shelter.
The inmates started giving them food, medicine, love and of course names.
Their furry charges include Gumbo, VooDoo and the Ragin' Cajuns a sextet of frisky black kittens.
A cat dubbed Katrina became displaced when her owner committed suicide in the hurricane's devastating aftermath.
When word of the hurricane reached the prison, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Richmond, Virginia, some inmates donated what little money they had to the victims.
There was not much else they could do until the cats arrived.
"Had I been at home, I probably would have gone down and helped," inmate Tuesday Kilgore, 35, said as she reclined in a chair next to her favorite cat, Skye.
"This gives me responsibility and gives me motivation to go out and live a so called normal life."
So far, nine of the Mississippi cats have been adopted, and Lynch hopes someday they'll all go to good homes.
At least one other prison Dixon Correctional Institute in Jackson, Louisiana has taken in pets displaced by Katrina, according to the Humane Society.
More than 200 animals have taken shelter in a converted dairy barn at that prison.
If Hurricane Katrina causes Congress to create a government safety net for the nation's pets, Rep Jim Oberstar says it won't be the first time that a higher power intervened on behalf of animals.
"God told Noah to make an ark and move the animals aboard," he said.
"There's at least a biblical antecedent for this."
Oberstar, D Minn., is co sponsoring a bipartisan bill that would force states and local governments to come up with emergency evacuation plans for pets.
Failure to do so would make them ineligible for disaster grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Oberstar, who has a year old chow/lab mix dog named Roux, said his heart went out to the shivering and bewildered pets that were stranded in the floodwaters in New Orleans.
And he's none too pleased that some rescue workers didn't allow people to take their companions with them when they fled.
"They were told, 'You come, leave your pet,"' said Oberstar.
Critics say the proposal for pet evacuation goes too far.
"People come before pets," said Chuck Morse, a Massachusetts Republican who's running for the House seat now held by Democratic Rep Barney Frank, another co sponsor of the bill.
Morse called the proposal ill timed as recovery operations continue on the Gulf Coast.
"We've got over a thousand people dead.
I don't think that's the time to offer legislation that forces FEMA to insist upon extra regulations before it issues funding to help people," he said.
The Humane Society of the United States says there are more than 358 million pets in the nation, residing in 63 percent of U.S. households.
Rep Tom Lantos, D Calif., the chief sponsor of the bill, said that Hurricane Katrina brought "unbelievable images into American homes every night," and that it was "just heartbreaking" to watch evacuees choose between being rescued or leaving their pets behind.
"Katrina taught us the hard lesson that as we prepare for future emergencies, it's important we include in our plans ways to protect our pet owners and their pets," said Rep Christopher Shays, R Conn., co chairman of the Congressional Friends of Animals Caucus.
Lantos and Shays wrote a letter to Michael Chertoff, secretary of the Homeland Security Department, asking whether the federal government has any plan to save the thousands of pets that are threatened when natural disasters occur.
"If indeed there is a plan to protect pets, it appears to have been an abject failure," they wrote.
Oberstar said he believes the legislation, called the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards (PETS) Act, has "great appeal."
It has two Republican co sponsors: Shays and Don Young of Alaska.
Oberstar, who was touring the Gulf Coast to assess the damage on Tuesday, said he hopes to get the legislation attached to his bill that would make FEMA an independent agency and give it Cabinet level status.
"This is not a matter of creating a hierarchy of values that you put pets at the top, but you put pets somewhere," Oberstar said.
He said there's also a health issue, because many abandoned pets die and their remains decay.
"We've made them dependent on us, and we have an obligation to them."
As thousands of animals remain stranded in hurricane ravaged Louisiana, trapped in homes or roaming evacuated streets, the head of the Humane Society complained Friday that authorities have ignored pleas to set a policy for animal rescues.
Many dogs, cats and other pets have been left to starve, said Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States.
He proposed that emergency responders be required to pick up animals they see if they are able to do so.
At best, they should sweep neighborhoods to collect pets, he said.
National guardsmen and other emergency workers are picking up animals on their own, but Pacelle said the plans should be more coordinated and clearly outlined by U.S. federal and state officials, a request he said was made and ignored.
"We shouldn't leave it up to a matter of personal conviction on behalf of the responders.
It should be a matter of state and federal policy to have the responders help with that effort," Pacelle said.
"I'm afraid because it's been so slow in happening, thousands of animals already have perished."
State and federal officials said pets have been rescued and, in many instances, evacuated out with hurricane victims even if no specific pet policy has been articulated.
Christopher White, a spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration, said of the 23000 people evacuated through the New Orleans airport, "every one of those people with an animal were allowed to bring that animal on board that aircraft."
More than 5000 animals have been rescued and sheltered so far, and more than 600 reunited with their owners, according to Joel Goldman, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's veterinarian in charge of Louisiana.
Animals are her specialty.
But even Dr Susan Eddlestone was impressed by how they came through the disaster.
"Animals are very tough, maybe tougher than people at times," said Eddlestone, an assistant professor in small animal medicine at the School of Veterinary Medicine at Louisiana State University.
"We saw animals rescued after three weeks," she said, "of being in houses and living on a bathroom counter with no food and drinking toxic water come in with their tails wagging, even though they were emaciated and had severe diarrhea and sometimes worse health problems."
Eddlestone, 42, volunteered immediately when a call for help went out, days after Hurricane Katrina.
The temporary animal shelter at Lamar Dixon Expo Center in Gonzales, La., 60 miles from New Orleans, was overwhelmed.
Eddlestone helped organize an additional shelter, at the university's Parker Coliseum in Baton Rouge.
Most of the 1200 animals she cares for on a given day settle in quickly.
"We turn the lights out and they all go to sleep," she said.
"It's like day care."
Life is hectic, too, at home in Baton Rouge, where Eddlestone has taken in her parents as well as a sister and her family and two dogs.
"I am from Chalmette, which is in St. Bernard Parish and took the brunt of the storm," Eddlestone said.
"My entire family lost their homes in St. Bernard.
My hometown was washed away forever."
Many animals at Parker Coliseum were dropped off by owners as they evacuated.
Large and sicker animals rescued from the street went to Lamar Dixon, where a colleague of Eddlestone's, Dr Rustin Moore, a professor of equine surgery, helped care for 350 rescued horses.
"Many were running loose," Moore said.
"People who stayed behind took care of the horses and helped us catch them.
They were very valuable.
We went back twice to take them food and generators.
We also brought out about 300 dogs and a few cats.
A couple of iguanas.
A goat."
The reunions have been heartening.
Eddlestone said she was touched by pet owners who wept and embraced shelter workers.
She cannot forget a woman who, though disoriented and sick, first made sure her dog got into a shelter.
The latest arrivals, Eddlestone said, are pets whose owners stayed behind with their animals until the water was drained from their neighborhoods.
It is no surprise, she said, that people who lost everything refused to leave without their pets.
"It's like leaving a child behind," she said.
"This is the only piece of hope they have that there's a future to go on."
"I am changed," she said, "in that I know what is important in life: our loved ones, including our pets, and nothing else."
Suffer the pooches, and the other abandoned creatures of the storm.
They are lethargic.
Or scared, if quivering is any measure.
And the really noisy ones are barking ferociously, like the brown pit bull looking dog who fixes his gaze on a visitor and snarls so intensely one can imagine him warning, "Get me outta here, or else!"
Paula Atzenhoffer is examining them all, and holding a tissue to her nose not from the overpowering stench of these hundreds upon hundreds of pets, but because she's crying.
She's come here to the Lamar Dixon Expo Center in search of her canine brood.
The last she saw of them was that awful Friday after Hurricane Katrina.
The police who came to rescue Atzenhoffer and her 13 year old grandson Charles from the streets of New Orleans made them leave their beloved dogs behind: Scout the sheltie, Datsun the dachshund and the dean of this canine crew, a Boston terrier named Pepe Le Pew.
Three pampered pets left to fend for themselves.
Atzenhoffer carries a photo album to this emergency outdoor animal shelter.
It will help her identify her dogs and prove ownership, should she find them as she walks from cage to cage amid the thick, hot air stirred by hundreds of portable fans.
Of the three, Atzenhoffer's especially worried about Pepe.
"Pepe had surgery three months ago, kidney stones.
And he has seizures," she explains delicately, wiping her eyes.
"They're all such sweethearts.
We dress them up for Halloween."
In one photo they're each wearing a Santa hat.
"These dogs are like our children."
This reality is playing out for hundreds of other pet owners each day at this Noah's ark of Katrina's aftermath, and on the streets of New Orleans and other towns along the Gulf, where pets are part of the ongoing evacuation even two weeks after the storm.
And they are part of the trauma many people surely still suffer.
Who can forget the little boy who cried so mightily that he threw up when rescuers wrenched from his arms his dog named Snowball?
"People were staying because they wouldn't leave their animals," says Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States, which runs the Lamar Dixon operation.
So, as rescue boats ply the rivery streets of New Orleans each day to find humans, so too do pet rescue boats search for marooned pets.
Sometimes animals and their owners are found together.
Sometimes the animals are found alone and sick from drinking fetid, contaminated street water.
They are brought here to Lamar Dixon, in a small town between New Orleans and Baton Rouge.
At its busiest, in the days after the storm, this facility held up to 2000 dogs, cats, rabbits, birds and horses, along with pet mice, rats, frogs and pythons, even a boa stored inside a plastic bin wrapped with duct tape, lest the creature escape and eat some of the hamsters and ferrets nearby.
A similar facility, at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, is housing more than a thousand pets.
Rene Bafalis, spokeswoman for the national Humane Society, says roughly 60 percent of New Orleans residents were pet owners.
Hundreds more pets arrive at Lamar Dixon each day, while similar numbers are dispatched to smaller shelters for longer term care.
The numbers have been so overwhelming that the Humane Society is trying to keep it to 1300, to better offer proper interim care of ailments such as canine dysentery, infections, cuts, malnutrition and dehydration.
The flood of pets is not expected to abate until the search and rescue operation is complete.
Instead of Noah, there are some 450 workers here: vets and staffers from the national and local Humane Society groups, as well as the U.S. Public Health Service and FEMA, along with volunteer vets and ordinary people.
There have been about 200 reunions here since the center opened two days after Katrina struck, Pacelle says.
Each day hundreds of people old, young, singles, families, of all hues arrive with hope of good news.
They register, write down descriptions of their pets, whether they were wearing an identification collar, perhaps even offer photos.
Then they begin their search, coursing up and down the lanes of small kennels and large crates searching for their companions.
Bafalis described one measure of how badly these animals want to be found.
To gain entry to a house with a barking dog, rescuers pulled out an air conditioning unit and a dog came flying out, jumping into the arms of a rescuer.
Not all pet owners simply left their animals behind, she says.
In some cases, "people had taken large bags of dog food and ripped them open before they left."
But it is looking hopeless for Atzenhoffer, of Slidell, La.
She and her grandson have walked from cage to cage for more than an hour, finding no Pepe, Scout or Datsun.
She's been to counseling for the horrors she witnessed on the streets during the flood.
She says Charles, her grandson, probably needs some help, too.
The day Katrina struck, she gathered Charles with the dogs at the hotel she manages.
But flooding forced them out after three days.
They ended up on a street corner.
"Rats were running around," says Atzenhoffer, tossing away the memory with a shake of her head.
And a very ill man died right in front of them a man whose name they did not know but who had a dachshund named Rudy.
When the man died, Atzenhoffer decided to take care of his dog, too.
But they had to leave Rudy behind with their own dogs.
Suddenly, as Atzenhoffer is speaking, Charles comes racing up, all red in the face and shouting, "Grandma!
We found Pepe!"
They run to the end of the row, to a small kennel in a medical ward.
Now Atzenhoffer's crying flat out.
She kisses Pepe through the cage, letting him lick her face.
"He's the old man.
He's been with us a long time," says Peter Allnet, Atzenhoffer's son, who's choked up, too.
Charles is jockeying for a look, too happy to cry, though the news is not all good.
"He's going to need to go right back to a veterinary hospital, because he has some serious injuries," says Jodi Witte, a FEMA veterinary technician.
There are deep lacerations around the little terrier's neck.
Later in the day, Atzenhoffer's private vet tells her that a large dog bit Pepe and apparently swung him from side to side, causing deep toothy gashes.
And one of his eyes was scratched.
But Pepe Le Pew will live.
And Datsun, Scout and Rudy (as well as her daughter's missing dogs, Buddy and Brinkley) may yet be found, Atzenhoffer hopes.
"Well, I'll just have to make another trip tomorrow till we find everybody.
They're not just animals.
They're my babies," she says, carrying Pepe toward the parking lot in a white towel, like swaddling clothes.
Another family is arriving two adults, three small kids.
They look tense, stressed.
Atzenhoffer holds up her prize, her Pepe, and calls out to them: "There's hope!"
An animal welfare group warned Friday that time was running out for pets abandoned in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, estimating that tens of thousands of animals had already died.
The Humane Society appealed for Louisiana state authorities and federal officials to intervene to ensure that any animals abandoned as residents fled New Orleans more than two weeks ago are rounded up and sent to rescue centres.
Wayne Pacelle, the president and CEO of the US society, said that while some 5000 animals had been rescued, "there are many more failures than successes."
"It is a critical situation now.
These animals have an incredible will to live, tens of thousands of them are still out there alive, in homes, roaming the streets," he said, warning that time was running out.
"We have literally now just a few days left," he told journalists in the state capital, Baton Rouge.
He said that while animal welfare workers had been working around the clock, they were up against an overwhelming challenge.
"We are not big enough to handle the magnitude of this crisis," he said, adding that the pace of recovery had already sealed the fate of many pets.
"I'm afraid that because it's been so slow in happening, thousands of animals have already perished."
Asked for an estimated toll of the number of domestic animals who may have died, he said: "Certainly tens of thousands."
"We want a policy to say that local, state and federal responders should actively assist animal rescue," he said.
"We need a swift and decisive declaration."
Pacelle said the group estimated that some 50000 animals were abandoned in households when the hurricane struck and that thousands had inevitably died.
Major Ed Bush from the Louisiana National Guard, which rescued thousands of people and animals from the floodwaters that engulfed New Orleans after Katrina struck on August 29, said that he was unaware of any official policy on rescuing animals from the disaster zone.
"From day one, our priority has been saving lives and getting as many people out as fast as we possibly could,Our number one priority has always been to save human life," he said.
He said that troops were authorised to destroy dogs that were found to be interfering with human bodies left on the streets as floodwaters from Hurricane Katrina receded.
Ousted Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev said Sunday he has signed the document on his resignation in the Kyrgyz Embassy in Moscow.
"We have just finished talks with the Kyrgyz parliamentary delegation led by (parliament speaker) Omurbek Tekebayev.
The talks proceeded in a constructive manner and demonstrated our full mutual understanding," Akayev told a press conference in the embassy after the talks.
The negotiations resulted in a four section document, one of which said, "the president of Kyrgyzstan announces his early resignation in compliance with his own statement," Akayev said.
The resignation ceremony will be held on Monday, he said.
The signing of the resignation document came after nearly three hours of talks between Akayev and the Kyrgyz parliamentary delegation, which arrived here earlier in the day.
Akayev, who arrived in the embassy shortly after at 3 p.m. local time (1100 GMT), first held a one hour talk with Tekebayev.
The talks were then joined by other members of the Kyrgyz delegation.
A day earlier, Akayev verbally agreed to relinquish power, a decision by a man described by Tekebayev as having "a sober view" on the situation in the country.
As head of state, "he is fully aware of his actions and has acted in the people's interests," Tekebayev said Saturday.
Akayev, Kyrgyzstan's president for the past 14 years, was accused of rigging the recent parliamentary polls to pave the way for winning a further presidential term later this year.
He fled his country late last month amid strong opposition protests.
Akayev fled his country on March 24 when opposition supporters stormed the main government building in Bishkek and has since hinted he wants to return and might resign if his security is guaranteed.
The president, as Kyrgyzstan's constitution stipulates, must address a parliament session in person to announce his resignation.
However, as Kyrgyz Foreign Minister Roza Otunbayeva has warned Akayev would be in danger if he returns to Kyrgyzstan, Constitutional Court Chairwoman Cholpon Bayekova said it would also be acceptable for a Kyrgyz parliamentary delegation to meet Akayev outside the country and bring his notarized resignation to Bishkek.
Tekebayev said upon arrival in Moscow, "Our mission has been authorized by the parliament.
We've arrived here with a notary who will document Akayev's resignation."
A delegation from the parliament of Kyrgyzstan will leave the capital Bishkek Saturday night for Moscow to negotiate with the country's ousted president Askar Akayev on his resignation, the parliamentary press office said Saturday.
The delegation, headed by Parliament Speaker Omurbek Tekebayev, will negotiate with Akayev, now in Moscow, on details concerning his resignation, the office said in a statement.
Akayev, who fled the country amid strong opposition protests last week, has hinted that he wants to return and might resign if his security is guaranteed.
Kyrgyzstan's constitution requires the president to return to Kyrgyzstan and announce his resignation to all members of parliament.
Earlier in the day, the chairwomen of the Kyrgyz Constitutional Court Cholpon Bayekova raised the possibility of Akayev's resigning abroad by saying that representatives of the parliament could go to Russia to collect and return with his resignation documents.
Akayev, Kyrgyz president for the past 14 years, fled his country on March 24 when opposition supporters stormed the main government building in Bishkek.
The opposition claimed Akayev rigged recent parliamentary polls to pave the way for winning a further presidential term later this year.
Askar Akayev signed his resignation as Kyrgyzstan's president Monday, lawmakers said, 11 days after he fled the country amid a popular uprising that saw his offices stormed by protesters and parts of the Kyrgyz capital looted by mobs.
The resignation to be effective Tuesday was signed at the Kyrgyz Embassy in Moscow a day after Akayev met with a delegation representing Kyrgyzstan's interim leadership, headed by parliament speaker Omurbek Tekebayev.
"Akayev has made an important decision," Kyrgyz lawmaker Tashkul Kereksizov said.
"The people needed it very much."
Kereksizov said Akayev had recorded a statement to the nation, the tape of which would be played to a session of the Kyrgyz parliament on Tuesday and then broadcast on Kyrgyz television.
The resignation is likely to be a significant step toward restoring political order to Kyrgyzstan, which plunged into uncertainty March 24 when an anti Akayev demonstration exploded into a clash outside the presidential administration.
Riot police guarding the building fled, and protesters rushed inside.
Akayev surfaced in Russia several days later.
By stepping down, he removes the last major obstruction to holding new presidential elections, which the interim government has tentatively scheduled for June 26.
"The revolution has taken place, the new government is working, but this document is necessary to bring the developments into the legal field," Kereksizov said.
Parliament will formally endorse Akayev's resignation Tuesday, he said.
Kyrgyzstan was the latest former Soviet country to be upended by popular protests.
Ukraine last year and Georgia in 2003 also saw popular uprisings force out entrenched leaders and bring to power reformers.
In his address to the nation, Akayev "listed the nation's achievements during his 14 1/2 year presidency, but also apologized to people who bore grudges against him," said Tekebayev's aide, Bermet Bukasheva.
"He voiced hope that the forthcoming presidential election will be democratic and fully transparent."
The 60 year old Akayev became leader of Kyrgyzstan in 1990, a year before it became independent in the collapse of the Soviet Union.
He was regarded as the most reformist and liberal of the ex Soviet Central Asian leaders.
During his first years of his presidency, Kyrgyzstan acquired the image of an island of democracy in a region noted for heavy handed autocratic leadership.
Opponents complained that in recent years, however, that he showed authoritarian leanings and that opposition activity was repressed.
The storming of the presidential administration building was the culmination of weeks of protests by opposition supporters who accused Akayev of manipulating parliamentary elections earlier this year to give him a compliant legislature.
Akayev fled, deepening his country's political crisis, as the previous and newly elected parliaments competed for legitimacy.
There were two nights of looting and gunfire in the capital, in which at least three people were killed.
The political chaos began to ebb last week after the previous parliament ceded authority.
Although the newly elected legislature has been seen as dominated by Akayev supporters, it nominated Tekebayev, an Akayev opponent, as parliament speaker.
Akayev had previously refused to recognize Kurmanbek Bakiyev, a former opposition leader approved by both parliaments as interim president, saying he considered Tekebayev the country's legitimate political leader.
But Kereksizov said Monday that Akayev recognized the new authorities.
"Akayev said that he wouldn't struggle against the new government, and that amounted to his recognition of the new Kyrgyzstan authorities," Kereksizov said.
"He said he will not confront the new government in either words or deeds and wished it success."
Prior to resigning, Akayev and members of the delegation on Sunday signed an agreement reaffirming that he would enjoy security guarantees granted to former leaders under the Kyrgyz law.
But Keriksizov said it was still too early for him to return.
"He will return some day to his native country, but he'd better stay in Russia for now," he said.
A delegation of Kyrgyzstan officials arrived in Moscow on Sunday for talks with ousted President Askar Akayev that they hope will lead to his formal resignation.
Parliament speaker Omurbek Tekebayev, who heads the delegation, said Akayev had given a verbal agreement that he would resign, 10 days after protesters stormed the presidential administration building.
Akayev fled to Russia after the storming, leaving the country in control of an interim government.
A meeting with Akayev was to be held in the Kyrgyz Embassy, Tekebayev said.
Akayev's resignation would likely be a significant step toward solidifying a sense of political order in the country following last month's chaos.
The interim authorities have tentatively scheduled a new presidential election for late June, but if Akayev were not to step down, the legitimacy of that election could be called into question.
"I think it's a truly historic mission," Tekebayev said on the flight from the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek.
"We hope to return tonight with his resignation."
Kyrgyzstan's interim authorities have said the law providing immunity to Akayev as president would be observed and that Akayev would not be persecuted if he returned to the ex Soviet Central Asian state.
However, Tekebayev suggested Sunday that a near future return for Akayev would be inappropriate because of anger among the populace against him.
Many accuse Akayev of corruption and obstruction of opposition political groups.
"The majority of people do not support our actions, they want immediate revenge," Tekebayev said.
However, he said, Akayev's resignation would ease conditions in the country.
"We think that the voluntary handover of power will create a new political situation in Kyrgyzstan.
We want to create a new tradition for Kyrgyzstan, to lay the basis for clean, honest elections," he said.
Kyrgyzstan's parliament has decided to hold a special session on Thursday to accept the resignation of exiled President Askar Akayev, which will help the Central Asian nation leave behind its recent political turmoil.
Parliament was forced to adjourn Tuesday without formally accepting the ousted leader's resignation because lawmakers failed to muster a quorum, adding to the confusion gripping this ex Soviet republic since March 24 when Akayev fled to Russia amid mass protests.
Parliamentary speaker Omurbek Tekebayev agreed with lawmakers Wednesday who called for Thursday's session to be broadcast live to this nation of 5 million and for representatives from all of Kyrgyzstan's political branches to be present.
Fifty five legislators present in the 75 seat Jogorku Kenesh Wednesday voted almost unanimously to endorse the decision.
"The whole country will be witness to the discussions," Tekebayev said.
Interim president Kurmanbek Bakiyev and the heads of the Supreme and Constitutional Courts have also been invited to attend the event.
An 18 minute farewell address recorded by Akayev in Moscow was to be played at the session.
Kyrgyz officials pushed hard to secure Akayev's resignation, seen as a significant step toward restoring political order and giving a stamp of legitimacy to new leaders.
A parliamentary delegation traveled to Moscow to persuade Akayev to sign a formal resignation, which lawmakers were expected to vote on Tuesday.
But parliament fell two short of its 50 person quorum.
Some observers blamed Tuesday's confusion to a lack of discipline and disorder typical of a new parliament settling into its job.
Tekebayev, who led the delegation to Moscow, acknowledged Tuesday that the delay meant Akayev continued formally to hold onto power albeit in exile.
Some officials are angry that Akayev is being allowed to resign rather than face impeachment.
"He deserted the country and the people," said acting Prosecutor General Azimbek Beknazarov.
"Had he not left the country to chaos, then we could have considered accepting his resignation."
Popular anger against what many saw as rigged parliamentary elections earlier this year fueled the revolt against Akayev, along with persistent poverty and widespread corruption.
The parliament elected in that vote was allowed to keep its seats despite Akayev's ouster, and it named one of the ousted president's longtime foes, Tekebayev, as speaker.
Kyrgyzstan was the latest former Soviet republic to be upended by popular protests.
Mass protests ushered the opposition into power in Ukraine last year and Georgia in 2003.
Akayev, 60, became leader of Kyrgyzstan in 1990, a year before it gained independence in the collapse of the Soviet Union.
His term was due to expire in October.
Authorities have scheduled new presidential elections for June 26.
President Askar Akayev, once hailed for creating an island of democracy in former Soviet Central Asia, paid a heavy price for betraying the trust of his people, who swept him from office in a popular uprising last month.
Although he effectively ceased being Kyrgyzstan's leader after fleeing the country ahead of demonstrators who stormed his office, Akayev's stubborn refusal to formally resign cast a shadow over the legitimacy of the nation's new leadership.
On Monday, he ended that uncertainty at the Kyrgyz Embassy in Moscow by signing a resignation agreement ending his 14 year reign.
When the end finally came, popular resentment against Akayev was so high that he chose to tape a farewell address to the nation, rather than return to give it live.
Akayev, 60, became president of Kyrgyzstan in 1991 in the dying months of the Soviet Union unusual for a former academic in a region largely run by career Communist bureaucrats who cultivated absolute power.
An ally of reformist Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, Akayev held out the promise of democracy and for a while, Kyrgyzstan was notable in the region for its relatively open politics.
But Akayev drew international criticism for abuses in elections and began to take a tougher line with opponents.
His image tarnished severely in 2002 when police killed six peaceful demonstrators in southern Kyrgyzstan and the government cracked down on opposition groups and independent media.
He was criticized for failing to bring officials responsible for the deaths to justice.
Corruption has also grown, with business leaders accusing Akayev's family of grabbing control over profitable enterprises, and rigging deals to line their pockets.
When Akayev's son and daughter won parliamentary seats this year, fears rose that the family was becoming all powerful.
Opponents worried that Akayev planned to seek a referendum on allowing him to run for another term, fears that intensified after the elections widely criticized by the West as unfair gave him a legislature overwhelmingly dominated by his supporters.
Akayev denied that, and blamed outside meddling for sparking protests in this nation of 5 million that resembled earlier actions in Ukraine and Georgia, which brought pro Western opposition leaders to power.
Most Kyrgyz reject those criticisms, but express fears that Akayev's overthrow won't lead to real change.
Born Nov 10, 1944, in the northern village of Kyzyl Bayrak, Akayev grew up in a family of collective farmers.
He graduated from the Leningrad Institute of Fine Mechanics and Optics in 1967 with an honors degree in math, engineering and computers and later received a doctorate from the Moscow Institute of Engineering and Physics.
He began teaching in 1977 at the Polytechnic Institute in Frunze, as the Kyrgyz capital was then known.
Some of his later Cabinet members were his former students and friends from his academic life.
In 1989, he was elected a representative for southern Kyrgyzstan at the Soviet Union's Supreme Council, where he was considered one of the liberal deputies and had close ties to Gorbachev.
Akayev was elected president by the Soviet Kyrgyz parliament in 1990, and was credited with calming ethnic tensions in southern Kyrgyzstan that year after clashes between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks killed dozens of people.
He was the only candidate in the 1991 presidential election, held less than two months after the Kyrgyz parliament declared independence from the Soviet Union.
Akayev was re elected in 1995 and 2000 in internationally criticized votes.
He rejected the criticism, saying that "Western standards (of democracy) can only be applied to the Western world."
After the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Akayev became a Washington ally by allowing U.S. led troops and planes to use Kyrgyzstan's main airport for combat operations against the Taliban regime in nearby Afghanistan.
But he also sought to maintain good ties with Russia.
He invited the Kremlin to set up an air base just 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the U.S. base, saying Kyrgyzstan would be "a land for cooperation between Russia and the United States."
Askar Akayev signed his resignation as Kyrgyzstan's president, lawmakers said, 11 days after he fled the country amid a popular uprising in which his offices were stormed by protesters and parts of the Kyrgyz capital looted by mobs.
The resignation to be effective Tuesday was signed at the Kyrgyz Embassy in Moscow a day after Akayev met with a delegation representing Kyrgyzstan's interim leadership, headed by parliament speaker Omurbek Tekebayev.

Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev has verbally agreed to resign as president, the Interfax news agency quoted the Kyrgyz parliament speaker as saying Saturday.
"A verbal agreement has been received from the president that he will relinquish power," said Omurbek Tekebayev, speaker of the newly inaugurated parliament elected in the disputed polls in February and March.
Akayev has "a sober view" on the situation in the country and, as head of state, "he is fully aware of his actions and has acted in the people's interests," Tekebayev reportedly said.
A Kyrgyz parliamentary delegation headed by Tekebayev will leave Saturday evening for Moscow to discuss with Akayev the details of his resignation, the Kyrgyz parliament press service said.
Akayev, who fled to Russia amid opposition protests last week, suggested in a Russian television interview Tuesday that he might be willing to submit a formal resignation if his security is guaranteed by the new Kyrgyz parliament.
Akayev's verbal consent to step down came shortly after the chairwoman of the Kyrgyz Constitutional Court, Cholpon Bayekova, said Saturday that Akayev is ready to put his resignation in writing.
Akayev is expected to sign a resignation document in Moscow, Tekebayev said, adding that the resignation ceremony in Moscow will be attended by a state notary and the press.
"All privileges will be guaranteed to him according to the law" if he resigns voluntarily, Tekebayev said.
"If he refuses to resign, it will be necessary to initiate an impeachment process, and in this case the president may be deprived of any guarantees," the speaker added.
Akayev, Kyrgyz president for the past 14 years, fled his country last Thursday when opposition supporters stormed the main government building in Bishkek.
The opposition accused the president of rigging the parliamentary vote to pave the way for winning a further presidential term later this year.
Kyrgyzstan's exiled president, Askar Akayev, has agreed in principle to step down, Kyrgyz officials said Saturday.
His resignation would pave the way for the opposition government that ousted him more than a week ago to recover its constitutional footing.
A delegation of Kyrgyz legislators will travel to Moscow on Sunday to negotiate final terms of the resignation, according to the speaker of the country's new parliament, Omurbek Tekebayev.
"We have received the president's verbal agreement," Tekebayev told Agence France Presse on Saturday.
He said that if negotiations failed, the parliament would start impeachment proceedings.
A parliament member confirmed Tekebayev's statement.
Akayev's resignation would calm Kyrgyzstan's stormy political waters and allow the nation's focus to shift from the ouster to presidential elections in June.
Many senior Kyrgyz politicians have announced their intent to run.
There are high hopes among Kyrgyz democracy advocates that with national and international attention so focused on the election, the voting could finally establish Kyrgyzstan as a truly democratic state.
Akayev fled the Kyrgyz capital on March 24 as mass protests outside the presidential compound turned violent.
Demonstrators broke through a security cordon around the building and damaged the inside, beating several senior officials severely.
But the leaders who quickly filled the vacuum Akayev left behind have struggled to establish their legitimacy in the absence of his formal resignation.
They recognized the new parliament, whose election had set off the protest movement, with the caveat that the positions of some of the newly elected members would be revoked because of campaign and voting abuses.
The Parliament called for new presidential elections on June 26, but none of the government's actions have been constitutional because Akayev remains the legal head of state until his mandate ends in October.
Akayev has demanded that in return for his resignation he be allowed to address the parliament and the nation.
But Kyrgyzstan's new government is reluctant to give him such a platform, fearing it could incite new unrest.
Lawmakers gathered Tuesday to hear ousted President Askar Akayev's farewell address and accept his resignation, almost two weeks after he fled Kyrgyzstan as opposition led protesters stormed his office and toppled his government.
Akayev, currently in exile in Russia, signed his formal resignation at the Kyrgyz Embassy in Moscow on Monday after talks with a parliamentary delegation led by Speaker Omurbek Tekebayev.
The resignation, witnessed by a Kyrgyz notary, needed to be presented to the 75 member parliament on Tuesday to become effective.
Lawmakers also planned to watch an 18 minute taped message from Akayev.
The message was to be broadcast on state television later Tuesday to the rest of this former Soviet republic of 5 million people.
Akayev had hoped to give his farewell address in person, but anger against the longtime leader still runs high, and the new leadership warned that his return could spark further unrest and put his life in danger.
Kyrgyz officials had pushed hard to secure Akayev's resignation, seeing it as a significant step toward restoring political order and giving a stamp of legitimacy to the new leadership, which rose to power amid widespread looting and chaos.
Akayev was ousted March 24 when a wave of protests that had seized southern Kyrgyzstan spread north to the capital.
Demonstrators stormed and ransacked the presidential administration building, sending the president and his family fleeing.
Akayev resurfaced in Russia several days later.
Popular anger against what many saw as rigged parliamentary elections earlier this year fueled the revolt, as did crushing poverty and widespread corruption.
The interim authorities have scheduled a new presidential election for June 26, but many feared its legitimacy would be undermined if Akayev clung to the presidency even in forced exile.
Before the revolt, Akayev's term was set to expire after new elections in October.
Kyrgyzstan was the latest former Soviet country to be upended by popular protests.
Ukraine last year and Georgia in 2003 also saw mass protests that ushered the opposition into power, and both dispatched envoys to Kyrgyzstan last week to offer their help.
In his address to the nation, Akayev "listed the nation's achievements during his 14 1/2 year presidency, but also apologized to people who bore grudges against him," said Tekebayev's aide, Bermet Bukasheva.
"He voiced hope that the forthcoming presidential election will be democratic and fully transparent."
The 60 year old Akayev became leader of Kyrgyzstan in 1990, a year before it became independent in the collapse of the Soviet Union.
He was regarded as the most reformist and liberal of the ex Soviet Central Asian leaders, but his increasing intolerance of dissent and his family's growing wealth turned public opinion against him.
Hundreds of opposition activists rallied in the Kyrgyz capital Saturday to urge President Askar Akayev to step down at the end of his term in October, amid fears he might try and hold onto power.
Around 300 people organized by a coalition of civic groups gathered near Bishkek's Victory Square, holding signs and placards.
The activists passed a resolution that called for the government to ensure that this year's parliamentary and presidential elections meet democratic standards.
"The president must provide conditions for free and fair elections for all candidates for president and pass his authority to a winner of the (presidential) election," the resolution said.
Meanwhile, hundreds of delegates to the Kyrgyzstan People's Assembly also gathered in Bishkek Saturday to praise Akayev's achievements during his 15 years in power.
The assembly is a government orchestrated event meant to represent all regions and ethnicities in Kyrgyzstan.
The delegates condemned the opposition and said Akayev was responsible for bringing stability and economic growth in 2004.
"President Akayev has always cared about the people and the country's well being," Vyacheslav Krasiyenko, a high school principal, said at the assembly.
Kyrgyzstan is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections on Feb 27, setting the stage for a presidential vote in October.
Akayev, who has been in power since before the 1991 Soviet Union collapse, has publicly pledged to hold the presidential election according to the constitution, which restricts the president to two consecutive terms.
Akayev is officially serving his second term.
Critics, however, fear that Akayev's supporters will try to hold a referendum to extend his term or that he will try to hand pick a successor.
Akayev is one of the most liberal leaders in formerly Soviet Central Asia but he has drawn increased criticism in recent years for alleged attempts to tighten control.
A protest in southern Kyrgyzstan over a dispute March 13.
The polls are being closely watched as a stepping stone to October 30 presidential polls at which President Askar Akayev has vowed to stand down a promise that some opposition figures distrust.
Western observers have strongly criticized the polls' standards, alleging violations by the election's administrators and dubious court decisions disqualifying several candidates.
Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev fired the interior minister and prosecutor general on Wednesday, his spokesman said, as a wave of opposition protests across the south kept up pressure on his government.
Akayev spokesman Abdil Seghizbayev said that officially, Interior Minister Bakirdin Subanbekov and Prosecutor General Myktybek Abdyldayev were dismissed at their own request, but that the dismissals were linked "to the events in the south and their poor work on preventing those events."
Seghizbayev said Akayev had named the security chief of his administration, Murat Sutalinov, as the new chief prosecutor, and Bishkek police chief Keneshbek Dushebayev as interior minister.
The protests began after the first round of parliamentary elections on Feb 27 and swelled after March 13 run offs that the opposition and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said were seriously flawed.
Protesters this week seized control of government buildings in two of Kyrgyzstan's seven regional capitals and a number of smaller locales.
Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev on Wednesday blamed the opposition leaders for inciting a civil war, said news from Bishkek, capital of the former Soviet republic.
The opposition, who were defeated in the runoff of the country' s parliamentary elections, made "provocative cries intended to plunge us all into illegality and the abyss of civil war and inter ethnic conflict," Akayev said on state television.
The opposition leaders "have thrown off their democratic masks and have openly begun calling for the authorities' overthrow," said the president.
Akayev's supporters won a landslide victory in the parliament elections held on Feb 27 with runoffs in many regions on March 13.
The opposition refused to accept the results and accused the authorities of fraud in the election.
They rallied, blocked roads and occupied several government buildings, demanding Akayev's resignation.
On Monday in the western Talas region, the opposition even took hostage a regional governor and a district chief.
Akayev has served the maximum two terms allowed by the constitution and has pledged to step down before the presidential election scheduled for October.
Kyrgyz Prime Minister Nikolai Tanayev vowed late on Sunday to seek negotiations to solve the dispute with the opposition over the country's recent parliamentary elections, said news from Kyrgyz capital Bishkek.
Tanayev said President Askar Akayev and himself were ready to have negotiations with the opposition at any time.
The prime minister said he had contacted the opposition leader in the current parliament and reaffirmed the government's stances, hoping that the opposition enters the country's leadership through legal procedures.
Thousands of opposition supporters, angered at what they say rigged elections, stormed government buildings in the southern Kyrgyz town of Jalal Abad on Sunday, following protests Friday in nearby Osh.
At least four policemen were reported beaten to death Sunday in clashes that broke out after police fired shots but failed to stop the demonstrations.

Kyrgyz police dispersed an opposition rally in the capital Wednesday as unrest over a parliamentary election dominated by pro presidential forces simmered for a second week, according to an AFP reporter on the scene.
Some 300 supporters of a candidate who lost his bid for a parliament seat to the daughter of Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev gathered in central Bishkek, in the words of one, to "hold a peaceful meeting to defend freedom of speech and honest elections."
Police detained some of the demonstrators after dispersing the gathering, witnesses said.
The police were not reported to have used excessive force.
Among those detained was the meeting's organizer, Bolot Maripov, who had unsuccessfully run against Akayev's daughter, Bermet Akayeva.
Maritov is also the founder of a respected daily in the Kyrgyz capital, Obshchestvennoye Mneniye.
The demonstrators had intended to march onto the seat of the government and the presidency.
Opposition supporters in Kyrgyzstan have held protests for more than a week since a March 13 run off election that saw the opposition presence in the 75 member parliament reduced to a mere handful of seats.
Kyrgyzstan's President Askar Akayev insisted that voting in crucial parliamentary elections in the former Soviet republic on Sunday was being conducted fairly, but a leading opposition figure cried foul.
"I believe these elections will be successful," Akayev said.
Voting equipment being used such as indelible ink for marking voters' fingers to ensure they vote only once and transparent ballot boxes "are all recognised as ensuring fair and honest elections," the Kyrgyz leader said after casting his vote in the capital Bishkek.
The parliamentary elections, which are a stepping stone to presidential elections on October 30, have been surrounded by controversy, with protests in several parts of this mountainous country in the days leading up to the vote.
Akayev insisted Sunday that there would be no attempt to change the constitution to give him a new term in office, as opponents have suspected.
"I don't plan to introduce constitutional changes today we have the ideal and optimal constitution and balance of power," Akayev said.
But prominent opposition leader Roza Otunbayeva of the Ata Jurt (Homeland) coalition said that "mass violations" had already occurred and called on Akayev to sack officials in his administration who she accused of orchestrating a signature gathering campaign aimed at getting constitutional changes allowing Akayev to remain in office.
"Mass violations began already began this morning,the election race was untransparent, there were mass violations (and) huge use of administrative resources" to affect the outcome of the vote, Otunybayeva said.
"The country is in danger today they've closed down all the press, we are totally closed,it's the government which wants to destabilise the situation," Otunbayeva told journalists.
Sunday's elections were closely watched, partly because Akayev's promises to stand down could be a first for the Central Asian former Soviet republics, where no national leader has stood down in polls since the end of Soviet rule in 1991.
Kyrgyzstan, a mountainous country of around five million people, hosts Russian and US airforce units at separate bases, the latter used by Washington for operations in Afghanistan.
The president of the central Asian state of Kyrgyzstan Tuesday put fellow citizens on guard against a pre election "revolutionary virus," in an apparent reference to recent events in two other former Soviet republics, Ukraine and Georgia.
"There wont be any kind of revolution or upheaval of course, there are no reasons for that, but we should be ready to strongly resist various attempts to introduce discord and upheaval or to commit disorder," said Askar Akayev, who has been in power here since Kyrgyzstan became independent from Moscow in 1991 with the end of the Soviet Union.
Akayev was speaking ahead of Kyrgyz parliamentary elections on February 27 that will set the stage for presidential polls on October 30.
"Internal and external attempts of this type can ,at a time of large scale political election campaigning, create additional opportunities for extremist forces to spread the pernicious viruses of discord and conflict," Akayev said on state television.
Like other leaders in the region Akayev has repeatedly voiced anxiety at recent popular opposition to the post Soviet old guard in Georgia and Ukraine, where more western oriented leaders have come to power.
The Kyrgyz polls are being closely watched because Akayev has vowed to stand down in October.
If he does, it will be be a first for the region, as no president has so far ever stood down at elections in the former Soviet Central Asian republics of Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.
Observers say Akayev is anxious that power should pass to persons who will not turn against the current first family, which has extensive business interests.
A son and daughter of Akayev are both standing in the elections to the 75 seat parliament.
However Akayev has so far not cracked down on the foreign non governmental organisations that some leaders in the region have blamed for Ukraine's and Georgias popular movements that voted down the old guard there.
Last month, the new leaders of Ukraine and Georgia denied that foreign interference sparked the "people power" movements in the ex Soviet nations.
"We categorically deny that these democratic and peaceful revolutions were instigated artificially or through external influence," Ukraine's Viktor Yushchenko and Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said in a joint statement.
Russia accused the United States of instigating the protests, which replaced Moscow friendly regimes with pro Western leaders.
Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev Tuesday refused to resign and annul the results of a disputed parliamentary election, saying that talks were the only way out of the crisis.
"It's obvious that there is no basis and thus there cannot be any talk of an annullment of the parliamentary elections," Akayev was reported as saying by news agencies in a televised address to his central Asian nation.
"We cannot put the legitimacy of newly elected deputies in doubt just because someone wants it so," he said.
"There isn't and cannot be a resolution of the issue by force," he said.
"All problems must be decided through a political route, by talks."
"As regards my resignation, the issue is outside the competence of meetings or political forces," he said.
"Only the people can make such a decision."
Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev on Monday ordered authorities in the central Asian nation to investigate charges of fraud in a recent parliamentary poll that sparked a series of opposition protests in the country's volatile south.
"Today President Akayev met with the chairman of the central election commission and the chairman of the supreme court," his spokesman Abdil Segizbayev told AFP by telephone.
"He ordered them to carry out an investigation into all instances of violations that occurred in the election process," he said.
The ITAR TASS news agency quoted Akayev as saying that he belived, however, that voting had been carried out "strictly according to the law."
The news agency quoted him as saying: "The events now include unlawful actions, massive demonstrations, attacks on representatives of law enforcement agencies who are carrying out their duties."
Job losses after Hurricane Katrina sent Louisiana's unemployment rate soaring to 11.5 percent, the highest level since the 1980s oil crash, officials said Tuesday.
The state Labor Department said in its monthly report that 234000 jobs were lost in September the majority in southeastern Louisiana after Katrina struck on Aug 29.
The figures represent only some of the fallout from Katrina, and none of the damage done by Hurricane Rita's foray into Louisiana on Sept 24.
The September unemployment rate was the highest since January 1987, when Louisiana's economy was reeling from a major oil price crash that resulted in a deep recession.
The jobless rate was 5.8 percent in August and 5.7 percent in September 2004.
Labor officials said in an early estimate last week that 296365 people were left unemployed by Katrina and Rita.
It said that in a seven week period that stretched into October, it processed 271846 eligible unemployment claims for Katrina and 24519 for Rita.
By comparison, there were 12710 initial claims for unemployment in August and 11946 in September of last year.
The death toll from Hurricane Katrina rose to 1121 Tuesday as 44 more bodies were found in Louisiana, authorities said.
The Department of Health and Hospitals said at least 885 people had died in Louisiana since the August 29 storm struck the Gulf Coast.
Officials in Mississippi said 220 people had died in that state.
Another 14 people were killed in Florida and two in Alabama, according to officials.
Rescuers continued to search for Katrina victims as the death toll from its successor, Hurricane Rita, which struck on Saturday, rose to at least 10.
The US House of Representatives on Wednesday approved a 6.1 billion dollar package of tax breaks to help families recover from Hurricane Katrina which hit the Gulf Coast areas late last month.
The House passed the bill with a vote of 422 0 and the bill has been sent to the US Senate, where lawmakers hoped to quickly give their final approval.
The package offers tax assistance to people and businesses dislocated by Hurricane Katrina and expanded tax breaks for some charitable donations to help them.
The tax breaks waive penalties for hurricane victims who need cash for expenses and recovery and want to use money stashed in protected retirement accounts.
Also under the bill, families that rely on the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit could protect those benefits throughout job losses, residency changes and family separations caused by Hurricane Katrina.
The Bosnian Red Cross announced on Thursday that it has started raising money for the victims of Hurricane Katrina in the United States.
By calling the Red Cross' phone number, Bosnians can donate euro1 (US$1.2) per call, the Red Cross said in a statement.
Agricultural losses from Hurricane Katrina in the United States are expected to reach an estimated 900 million dollars, US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns said Tuesday.
U.S. industrial output rose only slightly in August as Hurricane Katrina severely cut back production of petroleum and chemicals along the Gulf of Mexico coast.
The Federal Reserve reported Wednesday that industrial output rose a tiny 0.1 percent last month far below economists' expectations as Katrina, which struck the Gulf Coast on Aug 28, forced sharp cutbacks in oil and natural gas extraction in the Gulf of Mexico and also depressed output at refineries and chemical plants in the areas hit by the hurricane.
The number of deaths caused by Hurricane Katrina rose to 792 Thursday, after Louisiana announced 558 deaths in the state alone.
The death toll also included 218 deaths in Mississippi, two in Alabama and 14 in Florida.
The death toll in Louisiana saw a rise of 84 over the number announced on Wednesday.
Almost all the deaths in the state occurred in New Orleans, which was inundated by floodwater after levees protecting the city were breached by the hurricane, leaving many people stranded there.
Local officials estimated in the early days after the city was hit by Katrina that there might be as many as 10000 deaths in the city alone.
Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were hit by Hurricane Katrina in late August, causing heavy human and economic losses.
Turkey has allocated 2.5 million dollars to contribute to relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina devastated the US Gulf Coast, the foreign ministry announced Tuesday.
The statement said 1.5 million dollars was sent to the US Red Cross and the remaining funds would be spent on humanitarian supplies to be dispatched to the United States in the coming days.
Washington said Monday that 118 countries have provided aid to victims of Hurricane Katrina, which claimed at least 513 lives.
Lloyd's, the world's biggest insurance underwriting market, said Wednesday that it had provisionally forecast a 1.4 billion pound (2.08 billion euro, 2.55 billion dollar) net loss owing to Hurricane Katrina.
"Lloyds provisional estimate is that the markets net loss as a result of Hurricane Katrina is 1.4 billion pounds," it said in a statement.
"It should be stressed that it will not be possible, for some time, to have a precise view of the ultimate insured loss because this is a complex catastrophe, the full extent of the damage is unknown and the loss is still ongoing," it added.
Lloyd's said that its estimated loss was comparable with the impact of the four US windstorms in 2004, that resulted in a net loss to the market of 1.3 billion pounds.
Swiss Re, the world's second largest re insurer, said on Monday that it expected the total loss to the global insurance industry from Katrina to be around 40 billion dollars (32 billion euros).
British company Brit Insurance meanwhile last week forecast that the hurricane could leave the world's insurers facing a bill of up to 50 billion dollars.
Hurricane Katrina has claimed the lives of at least 650 people after hitting the southern US states of Lousiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida at the end of August.
The toll of Hurricane Katrina deaths rose to 657 Tuesday after Louisiana confirmed 144 additional deaths.
Louisiana's toll jumped Tuesday as swiftly receding floodwaters enabled rescue workers to get into more areas of New Orleans.
The total number of deaths attributed to Katrina now stands at 423 in Louisiana, 218 in Mississippi, two in Alabama and 14 in Florida, according to officials in the different states.
The hundreds confirmed killed so far falls well short of initial predictions that up to 10000 may have been claimed by the storm's winds and floods.
But Katrina now stands as the deadliest hurricane to hit the United States since 1928, when a storm killed 1836 people in Florida, according to the Miami based National Hurricane Center.
Hurricane Katrina could leave the world's insurers facing a bill of up to 50 billion dollars (40 billion euros), British company Brit Insurance forecast on Tuesday.
"The industry loss for Hurricane Katrina could be between 35 and 50 billion dollars," Brit's chief executive Dane Douetil told reporters after the company posted a 61 percent rise in interim pre tax profits.
Katrina will have "a profound impact on (insurance) market conditions", Douetil added.
Up until now the highest estimate has been 35 billion dollars, forecast by Risk Management Solutions a US group specialised in evaluating the financial cost of disasters.
Several European insurance giants have meanwhile predicted a ceiling of 30 billion dollars.
The Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa Al Thani decided on Saturday to contribute 100 million US dollars to the victims of the Katrina hurricane in the United States.
The Qatar News Agency quoted a source at the Foreign Ministry as saying that the donation was made in the name of the government and people of Qatar.
The source expressed solidarity with the US government and people at the tragic circumstances and offered condolences to the families of the victims.
Qatar "is following up with profound sorrow" the tragic results of the Katrina Hurricane, the source added.
A woman was killed in Mississippi when a tree crashed on her car, becoming the 11th fatality blamed on the powerful Hurricane Katrina that slammed the US Gulf coast after pounding Florida, local TV reported Monday.
Mississippi News Channel 12 said the woman was crushed under the tree uprooted by the hurricane in the small town of Carthage.
Three elderly people died on Sunday, apparently of dehydration, as they were being evacuated from New Orleans, and another seven were killed as the hurricane lashed Florida on Thursday.
Lloyd's, the world's biggest insurance underwriting market, predicted on Tuesday that the devastating impact of Hurricane Katrina would result in a "significant" number of claims.
"Lloyds expects to receive significant insurance claims as a result of Hurricane Katrina, predominantly in relation to offshore energy installations in the Gulf (of Mexico), property damage and business interruption," said a statement from the Lloyd's insurance market.
"We are today asking all insurers at Lloyds to supply details of the likely impact on their businesses, by Monday 12 September.
Those returns will allow us to give more information about the markets overall exposure.
"Despite the severity of Katrina, the Lloyds market is well equipped to manage the financial impact of a catastrophe on this scale.
"Clearly Katrina had a major impact on businesses and communities in the Gulf Region of the United States.
Lloyds priority now will be to assess and settle claims as speedily as possible, to help the reconstruction of that area."
Rescue crews worked frantically Tuesday to save hundreds of people trapped by floodwaters from Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the US Gulf Coast states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama and reportedly left dozens of people dead.
German reinsurance giant Munich Re has estimated that Katrina could cost the world's insurers up to 20 billion dollars (16 billion euros).
The official death toll from Hurricane Katrina has risen to 118 people in and around the swamped city of New Orleans, officials said Thursday.
The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals said the number of fatalities had risen from 83 since the last toll was announced on Tuesday.
The Foreign Ministry on Friday reported the first confirmed death of a Guatemalan due to Hurricane Katrina in the United States.
The ministry said that a woman identified as Rosa Barrios was found dead in her New Orleans home, but it gave no details.
The ministry said about 50 other Guatemalans are on a list of missing.
It estimates that 2100 Guatemalans livedin New Orleans.
Swiss Reinsurance Co., the world's second largest reinsurance company on Monday doubled to 40 billion US dollars its initial estimate of the global insured losses caused by Hurricane Katrina in the United States.
Swiss Re had previously agreed with the world's largest reinsurer, Munich Re, that the total losses would be 20 billion dollars.
The revised estimate has made Katrina the most costly hurricane in history.
The loss estimate was significantly increased because the damage caused by the hurricane was bigger than thought, Zurich based Swiss Re said.
"Due to the unique nature of the event, the complexity and the magnitude of destruction caused, accurate claims estimates remain difficult," it said.
Katrina has become the most costly hurricane in history, overtaking Hurricane Andrew in 1992, when claims reached 22 billion dollars, according to Swiss Re figures.
Swiss Re also more than doubled to 1.2 billion dollars the estimate of the claims the company itself may face.
The company may not able to meet its target of 10 percent growth in earnings per share this year, but it said it will use its reserves to cushion the impact of the hurricane.
Hurricane Katrina caused a first fatality in southeastern Florida Thursday when it sent a tree crashing on the roof of a car in Fort Lauderdale, local television reported.
A 25 year old man was killed when the tree fell on the car in which he was traveling, CBS 4 television reported, quoting local authorities.
The report came as the eye of the hurricane was still a few kilometers offshore and expected to make landfall near Fort Lauderdale, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Miami.
The bill for the Hurricane Katrina disaster effort has so far reached 2.87 billion dollars, federal officials said on Tuesday.
The figure is made up of emergency mission response orders issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), officials said.
"We know what our bill is so far, there are mission expenses of 2.8 billion dollars," said FEMA spokesman David Passey.
The Ugandan government has pledged 200000 US dollars toward relief and rebuilding efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, local press reported on Friday.
"The US had been generous in responding to natural and humanitarian disasters all over the world, include in Africa ,justice requires us to aid the people in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, who have lost their homes and loved ones," President Yoweri Museveni was quoted by The New Vision as saying.
Ugandan Foreign Minister Sam Kutesa said the money would be donated to the Bush Clinton Katrina Fund, led by former US presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton.
"The government of Uganda extends its sympathies to the people affected by Hurricane Katrina," Kutesa said.
Hurricane Katrina, one of the worst natural disasters, hit the southern part of the United States on August 29, causing heavy casualties and damages.
A Christian general in the Iraqi police force was shot dead late Wednesday as he drove home in the northern oil city of Kirkuk, police said.
General Waed Yussuf Yacoub, who worked at the interior ministry and was a pillar of the Christian community in Kirkuk, was gunned down when a car pulled up alongside his vehicle, said a police spokesman.
Yacoub, a member of the Chaldean Assyrian Church, helped recruit Christians to Kirkuk's police force.
Iraq's 700000 Christian community has been targeted by rebels since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in April 2003 and many members of the dwindling minority have fled the country.
The Al Qaeda linked Army of Ansar al Sunna claimed it had killed a Christian general in the Iraqi police force earlier this week in northern Iraq, in a statement posted on an Islamist website on Friday.
"On the main Baghdad road in the northern city of Kirkuk, a group of fighters ,attacked the head of the police, a Christian general, with assault rifles," said the group in an overnight statement.
"The general was killed and the knights returned safely to base," it said.
The authenticity of the statement could not be confirmed.
Police had said earlier that General Waed Yussuf Yacoub was shot dead late on Wednesday as he drove home in the northern oil city of Kirkuk.
The general, who worked at the interior ministry and was a pillar of the Christian community in Kirkuk, was gunned down when a car pulled up alongside his vehicle, they said.
Yacoub, a member of the Chaldean Assyrian Church, helped recruit Christians to Kirkuk's police force.
Iraq's 700000 Christian community has been targeted by rebels since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in April 2003 and many members of the dwindling minority have fled the country.
The Army of Ansar al Sunna has claimed a string of attacks in Iraq, including murders of foreign hostages and Iraqis accused of "collaborating" with US led forces.
It has released video footage showing some of the killings.
The group also claimed a December 21, 2004 attack on a US base in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul that killed 22 people, including 14 US soldiers.
In a city where churches have been bombed by Muslim insurgents and Christians are an imperiled minority, several hundred Catholics gathered at St. Joseph's Chaldean Church on Thursday to attend a special Mass for Pope John Paul II.
Under a golden, late afternoon sun, the worshippers passed through a protective cordon of red bereted soldiers from the newly trained, mostly Muslim Iraqi army.
Inside, amid air smoky with incense, a tearful congregation recalled the Polish born man who had given help and hope to Iraq's dwindling Christian communities.
"The pope won the hearts of everybody because he worked for the good of all," said Patriarch Emmanuel Delly, the head of Iraq's Chaldean Catholic Church.
John Paul's death "was a loss not only for Iraqi Catholics and Christians but indeed it was a loss for the whole world," the patriarch said.
Delly concelebrated the Arabic language Mass with the heads of three other Catholic communities here Latin, Armenian and Syrian and a representative of the papal nuncio's office.
"John Paul II has been very close to Iraqis," Archbishop Jean Sleiman of Baghdad's Roman Catholic, or Latin, community said in an interview earlier this week.
"Christians need a protector, or father, someone who protects them, and I think the pope is one who protected them."
John Paul opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and criticized the U.S. inspired U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
Sleiman and Delly both recalled the pope's disappointment at not being able to visit Iraq in 1999.
"Officially, the regime said it couldn't protect him," Sleiman said, adding that he thought Saddam Hussein had been "afraid the pope would have more crowds than him."
Many in the congregation said it was a service they could not miss, despite the violence that makes travel risky in the Iraqi capital.
"I did not care if it is dangerous to come here today," said a government employee who gave only her first name, Haifa.
"If I die, I will die here in the church with Jesus.
When you have a soul of faith, it kills every fear inside your body."
Iraqi soldiers in pickup trucks were stationed several blocks from the church in all directions, searching cars, asking for ID cards and politely asking anyone not going to the service to take an alternative route.
Most Christians appeared happy with the extensive security.
"I feel so safe," said Abu Adwar as he walked to the church with his wife and two children.
"And did you notice that there was no American army around?
It is a full Iraqi operation."
Iraq has an estimated 800000 Christians, but another 300000 had emigrated since 1991, said Yonadam Kanna, one of six Christians elected to Iraq's new National Assembly.
Sleiman said his Roman Catholic community had 60000 members before the 1991 Persian Gulf War, now it has around 5000.
In a display of solidarity, five Shiites, including a black turbaned cleric from Iran, attended the Mass for the pope at St. Joseph's.
"It is a big honor to come here and join our friends and brothers at this service," said the Iranian, Ali Akbar Hakim.
"We lost a man who was a symbol for peace, justice and faith in the world, and we wish that God will replace him with a man like him," Hakim said of the pope.
"We wish that God will take him to heaven and give his family and friends the patience to withstand this loss."
Gunmen stormed a house in eastern Baghdad Sunday night and shot dead four Christian women in an apparent robbery, police said.
The attack occurred in Baghdad's eastern neighborhood of Ghadeer and valuables were stolen from the house, said police Lt. Ali Mutaab.
The four women died instantly, he said.
Ghadeer is a predominantly Christian neighborhood and is known to be calm compared to other Baghdad neighborhoods.
Christians, mostly from the early Assyrian and Chaldean churches, were targeted in August 2004 when four churches in Baghdad and one in Mosul were blown up in a coordinated series of car bombings.
Since then thousands of Christians fled to Syria and Jordan.
Like a lot of Iraqi Christians, Wasseem Dawood has adjusted to the new ways of marking Christmas.
Like always, he will visit relatives, eat rich foods and buy new clothes.
And this year, he will keep watch outside his church with a Kalashnikov rifle.
A mechanic by training, Dawood, 21, became a guard for his church after it was gutted in a bombing a year ago.
He got 20 days of training in how to shoot straight and spot terrorists, a police salary of about $125 a month and a rifle from the government agency that supports churches.
His Greek Catholic(cq) Church of St. George had its walls blown out and its insides charred and gutted.
The blast blew limbs off the Jesus figure on the crucifix behind the altar but it was preserved, and the stately, domed church is being rebuilt, largely by volunteers.
Worshippers plan to hold mass in the unfinished shell on Sunday.
In recent days, children were in the church annex sharpening up their high pitched, Arabic Jingle Bells and rehearsing the localized journey of the Three Wise Men, tracking the nativity star from the Iraqi cities of Basra, Kirkuk and Suleymaniya.
Amid Christmas trees and tales of the jolly, bearded Baba Noel (Santa Claus), many in Iraq's Christian minority dream of leaving the country but bravely continue with the traditions of their faith.
"I have to protect the church.
There is a priest here and our God protects us," Dawood said last week by the palm tree trunks that form a barrier to the church entrance.
"(But) yeah, anyone who holds a Kalashnikov is in danger."
On Oct 16, 2004, bombers struck five churches, including St. George's, nearly simultaneously.
That and other church attacks in 2004 killed 20 or so, according to reports at the time.
But this year was not as deadly for Christians and some say this third Christmas in the chaotic aftermath of the U.S. led invasion will be more relaxed if only because they are now familiar with the dangers.
Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve is now routinely held in the daylight hours of the afternoon.
Rarely do they now hold the parties, primed with whiskey and running into the early morning, that brought large numbers of Christians and their Muslim friends together in social clubs and hotels.
"It is a little bit better because more people are used to the situation," said Amir Oraha, a spokesman for the largest Christian political party, the Assyrian Democratic Movement.
"People should live their lives."
Estimates vary but there are perhaps 800000 Christians in Iraq making up about 3 percent of the population.
There are five major denominations the largest the Chaldean Catholics and several smaller ones.
Dozens of churches are spread through Baghdad, some graceful and domed and some boxy and non descript.
Northern Iraq has large Christian communities.
But more Iraqi Christians live outside Iraq than inside, the result of nearly a century of steady emigration.
It's been motivated by mob violence going back to the Ottoman Empire's rule of Iraq and spans through the crushing poverty of economic sanctions and Saddam's brutality in the last decade.
Some today feel threatened by the Islamic fundamentalism unleashed with the collapse in the old police state.
Christians have more opportunity for flight than do their Muslim neighbors, who face as many dangers.
Most already have relatives abroad and enough money to move, but some say it is harder to leave now than under Saddam, when Christian countries were looser with asylum requests.
Christian activists give differing numbers from 20000 to 200000 for the number of Christians who have left the country since the American takeover.
So one of the Christmas rituals these days is to make phone calls to close relatives far away.
Samir Naum al Hayak, 43, a tool shop employee, will be getting in touch with brothers and other kin in Detroit, Chicago and Denmark.
He lives around the block from St. George's and notes that seven families on his half mile long street have left the country since early 2003.
Desire to emigrate is almost a given.
"If I have the ability, I will go," he said.
At St. George's, as in many churches, there is an informal approach to the denominational lines and Christians of different sects attend.
Guard Dawood's family is Chaldean but has been attending the church since he was a little boy.
They held mass in the church the day after the bombing that, despite the extensive damage, did not wound any one in the early morning hours.
Along with the reconstruction of the church itself they have added a 12 foot high wall around the perimeter.
Anita Dawood, Wasseem's 22 year old sister, has been brushing up on her Christmas carols with the church choir.
She said rehearsals were cancelled last year in the wake of the bombing but this year they went ahead with them.
A philosophy and religion student, she said she would like to go to any country with, "peace and stability."
For now, she plans to decorate the tree, bake cakes and make the usual nativity scene in their house.
"It will be happy even though we live in bad circumstances," she said walking home with her mother from choir practice.
"All the churches are threatened but we will go to mass." Larry Kaplow can be contacted at lkaplowcoxnews.com
The patriarch of the Iraq based Chaldean Church, Emmanuel Delly, said Thursday that Iraq's future constitution should not solely be based on the Koran, despite the country's overwhelming Muslim majority.
"Ninety five percent of the Iraqi people are Muslims.
The government should be Islamic but the Koran cannot be the sole source for the constitution," Delly told a press conference in Paris.
Iraq's small Christian community represents only about three percent of the country's population.
With 600000 followers, the Chaldean Church accounts for the vast majority of Iraq's Christians.
Delly said he had discussed Iraq's future constitution with the most influential Shiite cleric in the country, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani.
The Chaldean patriarch said Sistani had told him he "did not want a government that was only for Shiites or Muslims in general", adding that new Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari "says the same thing".
Jaafari pledged Sunday to get more Sunnis involved in drafting the constitution after meeting with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her surprise visit to Iraq.
Iraq's parliament has just set up a committee to draft the constitution by a deadline of August 15.
The draft is then to be put to a nationwide referendum by October 15 under a deadline set by the US inspired transitional administrative law (TAL) currently governing Iraq.
The constitution must "offer religious freedom to all in Iraq, but also personal liberties," Delly said.
Delly, who has been in France for the past week, met with French President Jacques Chirac on Monday.
He was to celebrate a mass with the Archbishop of Paris, Andre Vingt Trois, on Sunday before leaving the country.
Members of the Iraqi Christian minority living in the United States voiced hopes that a spirit of cooperation and national unity would prevail in Iraq even as Shiite Muslims prevailed in that country's first free elections in over 50 years.
A Shiite Muslim clergy backed slate won 48 percent of the votes and 140 of the 275 National Assembly seats, according to results released Sunday in Baghdad.
A Kurdish ticket got 26 percent and 75 seats.
But the country's Christian minority, which makes up about 5 percent of Iraq's 26 million people, secured enough votes for just one Assembly seat.
"We are extending our hands to our brother Shiites, and Sunnis in Iraq, to work together to have a ,better, democratic Iraq," said Joseph Kassab, president of the U.S. branch of the Chaldean National Congress.
Unlike most of Iraq's Sunni Muslim community the disenfranchised group believed to be driving the deadly insurgency in the country Chaldeans and Assyrians joined Shiites and Kurds in making their voices heard during the elections.
But with the National Rafidain List securing just 36255 votes compared to the more than 4 million votes for the Shiite's United Iraqi Alliance, Christians must pin their sights on partnership and support from the other groups to ensure that their interests are secured as the Assembly drafts Iraq's new constitution.
"The Shia are good friends to the Christians," said Kassab, voicing hopes that the suffering both groups endured under Saddam Hussein's regime would bridge any rifts.
The imam at the area's leading Iraqi Shiite mosque said he, too, felt hope mixed with fear.
"It's a good beginning.
Not perfect, but a good beginning," said Husham al Husainy of the Karbalaa Islamic Education Center in Dearborn.
"We should work toward unity, whether Shia or Sunni or Kurdish."
For a fragile democracy to take root after 35 years of Saddam's dictatorship and two years of occupation, Iraqis, the U.S. government and Iraq's neighbors must defend it against those who prefer chaos or oppression, he said.
"There is so much potential of civil war, of ethnic clashing.
It's still flammable," al Husainy said.
Chaldean Americans, who are heavily concentrated in the Detroit area, were pleased to see their homeland moving in a democratic direction after decades of dictatorial rule, Kassab said.
But Kassab complained that many Christians in Iraq, particularly in the northern Sunni Muslim province of Nineveh, were unable to cast votes.
Turn out was low in Sunni areas, partly due to security fears and because of Sunni clerics who called for a boycott of the elections.
Election officials also said that many polling stations in the province either didn't open or ran out of ballots.
"We lost more than 150000 votes in northern Iraq," he said.
Iraqi Americans cast 8975 votes Jan 28 30 at a polling site in the Detroit suburb of Southgate.
In all, 24335 of the 265148 overseas votes were cast in the United States.
In addition to the single seat won by the National Rafidain List, which represented Chaldean, Assyrian and other Christian groups, four Christians won seats on the Kurdish ticket and one was elected on the slate of interim Prime Minister Ayad Alawi, Kassab said.
Kassab said that the main concern for Iraqi Christians now is that minority rights be enshrined in the constitution to be written by the National Assembly.
"We need them to reconfirm the rights of all Iraq's minorities and religions," Kassab said.
ASSYRIANS FEAR IRAQ CONSTITUTION (From McClatchy News Service, for use by New York Times News Service clients.)
For Release Sunday, July 10 WASHINGTON The new Iraqi constitution is already shaking the San Joaquin Valley, and it's not even written yet.
Local Assyrians worry the new constitution will favor Islam over Christianity.
Their worries mobilize local lawmakers, who are now starting to lean on the Bush administration.
"(They are) incredibly concerned about the current drafting of the constitution," Merced Democrat Dennis Cardoza said.
"The reports they are hearing is that (Iraq is) drafting a fundamentalist Islamic document."
The local worries and the political response they generate illustrate how ethnic constituencies shape congressional action.
Beyond that, the long distance lobbying over Iraq's constitution highlights the controversial power the United States retains over a sovereign nation.
Much closer to home, it could shape at least one local congressional race.
With between 30000 and 45000 Assyrians thought to be living in Merced, Stanislaus and San Joaquin counties, the region claims one of the largest such populations in the United States.
Assyrian media serves the region, as do Assyrian churches, and politicians know to be attentive.
Recently, Cardoza met with His Beatitude Mar Emmanuel III Delly, the patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church.
The Assyrian religious leader advised Cardoza about developments in Iraq, prompting the congressman to echo the concerns in a July 6 letter to President Bush.
"The Assyrian people suffered greatly in their attempts to obtain greater freedom and recognition," wrote Cardoza, a member of the House International Relations Committee.
"It would be outrageous for minorities who have suffered and sacrificed so much to not be afforded protection under the new constitution."
Some Republicans, though, view Cardoza's solicitude skeptically.
"The Assyrians, to be perfectly honest, until now haven't seen too much of Congressman Cardoza," said John Kanno, an Assyrian who has declared his candidacy against Cardoza.
"All of a sudden, he's pandering to the Assyrian community now that he's got an Assyrian running against him."
Kanno's parents left their native Iraq in 1957 58, he was subsequently born in England, and has lived in the United States since 1981.
An engineer now living in Modesto, Kanno did agree with Cardoza that "we want freedom of religion" and "some kind of safe haven" under the new constitution.
In June 2003, Cardoza introduced a House resolution expressing concern about the status of Assyrians in post war Iraq.
The resolution gained 10 co sponsors, including Mariposa Republican George Radanovich, but did not reach the House floor.
The transitional law currently governing Iraq calls for a draft of the new constitution to be completed by Aug 15.
It is supposed to be submitted to the Iraqi public for ratification by Oct 15.
One six month extension is permitted, in case Iraqi officials cannot meet the original deadlines.
This week, the Iraqi National Assembly committee drafting the constitution was expanded to 71 members with the addition of 15 Sunnis.
Dominated by Shiites, the committee includes one Assyrian Christian, 15 Kurds and one communist, among others.
Iraqi officials insist no extension will be needed.
"We're going to stay on that timetable," Bush told reporters last month, following a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al Jaafari, "and it's important for the Iraqi people to know we are."
A current draft of the proposed constitution, translated by George Washington University scholar Nathan Brown, includes a provision stating that "discrimination on the basis of gender, nationality, religion, origin or social standing is forbidden."
The draft also states that "the Iraqi citizen has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religious creed and religious rites."
At the same time, with Muslims making up more than 90 percent of Iraq's population, Islam may well be declared the nation's official religion.
In an interview, Brown said Friday that while the "principles" of religious tolerance will be articulated in the constitution, "the devil will be in the details" as the new Iraqi Parliament begins writing specific laws.
The United States, Brown added, will have "some influence" in this, but won't be able to dictate the complete work.
Still, Cardoza said that "we have a certain amount of pressure we can bring to bear" on the Iraqis who are writing their nation's new governing documents.
"A number of our young men and women have died to bring them their freedoms," Cardoza said.
About a third of expatriate Iraqis who voted by absentee ballot last week in the United States chose the Shiite party backed by Iraq's leading clerics, followed closely by a party made up of Iraqi Christians, according to provisional results released Friday.
The United Iraqi Alliance, which was endorsed by the influential Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali Al Sistani, won nearly 32 percent of the 24278 valid votes cast at five polling sites in the United States.
The ticket led expatriate voting around the world and in Iraq in early results from Sunday's vote.
A slate of Chaldean and Assyrian Christians called the National Rafidain List polled about 29 percent in the United States, where it found its largest bloc of votes among the 14 nations where elections were held for Iraqis living abroad.
The Kurdish ticket Kurdish Alliance List received nearly 17 percent of the U.S. vote, while the list led by current Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, which had been expected to do well among expatriates, only won about 4 percent of votes in the United States.
The votes will help determine the makeup of a new National Assembly, which will draft Iraq's new constitution.
Each faction is given seats based on its overall share of the vote.
Results were released by the International Organization for Migration, which ran the overseas voting.
The American sites included Washington, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles and Nashville, Tenn.
Some Iraqi groups criticized the U.S. vote because it was held at only five sites and organized in just a few weeks.
Some voters had to drive hundreds of miles twice, once to register and a second time to vote.
Joseph Kassab, president of the Chaldean National Congress, based in the Detroit area, said more Christians compose a large portion of the Iraqis living in the United States, which likely accounted for the strong showing by the National Rafidain List.
The party also polled well in Australia, where 36 percent voted for it.
Kassab said he feared the expected Shiite majority will not be attentive to minority parties and groups in Iraq, such as Christians.
"We need to make sure we have a good secular government so the constitution of Iraq recognizes the rights of minorities and other ethnic groups," he said.
Raaed Al Haddad, 30, of Raleigh, North Carolina, said he voted for the United Iraqi Alliance because he felt it was an inclusive ticket, with Sunni Muslims and Kurds included among its leaders.
Al Haddad, a Shiite Muslim, was also pleased that some of the minority groups had a strong showing in the U.S. voting.
"We need this in the government," he said.
"We need the Sunnis, the Christians and the Kurds."
Hundreds of Iraqis shouted slogans and waived Iraqi flags Sunday outside Baghdad's heavily guarded Green Zone to protest alleged voting irregularities in Mosul that they say prevented tens of thousands from voting in last weekend's landmark elections.
The demonstrators were mainly Iraqi Christians, Turkomen and Yazidis members of a small religion in the north who say polling centers never opened in their neighborhoods in the turbulent northern city and in the surrounding Ninevah province.
Electoral commission officials in Baghdad have acknowledged that many polling sites never opened or opened late on Jan 30 and said that was because of security concerns.
Some of those that did open could not be supplied with ballots and other election materials, officials have said.
A team of independent lawyers is investigating those and other complaints in the city and is to report back to the electoral commission.
"We are protesting because we have been deprived of our right to participate in the elections," said Shameil Benjamin from a Christian party called the Democratic Assyrian Movement.
"There were irregularities and we felt that the injustice was inflicted on us," he said.
A spokesman for Chaldean and Assyrian parties, William Warda, said the irregularities prevented 200000 people from voting.
The demonstrators gathered outside the Green Zone, which houses the offices of the interim Iraqi government as well as the U.S. and British embassies.
The Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq is also based inside the compound.
Banners held aloft read, "Assyrians, Turkomens, Yazidis have the right to enjoy the essence of freedom" and "We demand our democratic rights and we reject marginalization."
Mosul has become a flashpoint for insurgents battling U.S. and Iraqi security forces in recent weeks.
In November, rebels launched an uprising there that forced nearly the entire police force to desert their posts.
Christians in Iraq did not celebrate Christmas this year as they did last year, as they cancelled the midnight mass early Saturday, main feature of the celebrations, due to curfew.
"Christmas is not only a tree and decoration, but it is an occasion through which we emphasize the importance of restoring security in Iraq and staying unified in spite of different religions and ethnic groups," said one of Christian.
Christians and churches were attacked many times amidst chaos and instability that prevailed in the war torn country since the US led war on Iraq in March 2003, while extremists claim that they are fighting against US troops and whoever is cooperating with them, and also accuse the United States of launching a Crusade on Muslims.
The armed attacks led to the exodus of thousands of Christmas to Syria and Jordan.
Religious minorities in Iraq, especially Christians, account for 3 percent of the population of 25 million, most of them Shiites and Sunnis.
Freedom of religion is stipulated in the interim constitution adopted last March and applied until a permanent one next year.
The constitution of 1970, adopted by former regime, guarantees freedom of religion and prohibits any religious discrimination.
In 1972, the administration of Baath, the ruling party at that time, declared officially that other nationalities are Assyrian, Chaldean and Syrian.
Iraq has Syrian Catholics and Orthodox and Armenian Catholics and Orthodox, and recently, after the British mandate, protestants, and Catholics of the Latin Church.
Christians hold only one portfolio in the interim government of Iyad Allawi.
Poverty and consecutive wars let many Christians leave Iraq.
When Sanctions were imposed on Iraq in 1990 due to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, many Christians, who were living in perfect harmony with Muslims, left the country to join their relatives in the West.
Most of Christians in Iraq are in Baghdad and northern cities.
Although Christians represent only 3 percent of the Iraqi population, some of them are elite of cultured and professional experts who are very much respected by the people.
According to opinion of some of Islamist trends, Islam is attached to Arabism and this had driven Christians out of the Arab nationality, which created an identity crisis to them.
The danger in this overlapping between political and religious concepts is that it would always have a religious explanation for every political difference, which is a time bomb in an eastern society of multiple religions and sects.
For the first time in their lives, Widad Mikho and her sister Neshwan will not attend Mass on Sunday, too frightened after a series of church bombings across Baghdad.
But fear will not keep Dana George away.
"It would be better to die in church than anywhere else," she said.
Iraq's Christians, increasingly targeted by insurgents, are fleeing Baghdad for the safety of the Kurdish north or neighboring Syria and Jordan.
After Saturday's bombings of five churches which damaged buildings but caused no casualties Christian leaders fear more will leave.
But the exodus is temporary, insist many, because they are not selling their homes and property.
They will wait it out and return when the situation improves.
Pascale Isho Warda, a Christian who is the interim government's minister for displacement and migration, estimated as many as 15000 out of Iraq's nearly 1 million Christians have left the country since August, when four churches in Baghdad and one in Mosul were blown up in a coordinated series of car bombings.
The attacks killed 12 people and injured 61 others.
Another church was bombed in Baghdad in September.
Saturday's "explosions will no doubt push people to immigrate," said Father Raphael Qutaimi, acting bishop of the Syrian Catholic Church.
"But this country has been ours for thousands of years.
Our ancestors shed blood defending it.
We mustn't leave it."
He and all the dozen Christians interviewed Saturday said the attacks were not the work of Muslim Iraqis, but foreigners.
"The foreigner is trying to create division and enmity between Christians and Muslims.
We must stand hand in hand and heart to heart and not give the outsider cause to divide us," Qutaimi said.
"They want us to leave Iraq," said Surah Samaan, a 25 year old lab technician, referring to the attackers, who she believes are Arabs linked to al Qaida.
But Yonadem Kana, secretary general of the Assyrian Democratic Movement, said the general security situation of the country car bombings, kidnappings and murders, which affect all of Iraq's religious groups had chased away many Christians.
"They figure instead of staying and paying $50000 (euro40275) to kidnappers for ransom, they can spend $5000 (euro4025) in Latakia or Damascus," he said, referring to two cities in neighboring Syria.
He said more than 100 Christians had been murdered after the U.S. led war, including 35 liquor vendors and others who worked for coalition forces.
About 200 more have died in the general violence that has gripped Iraq.
Insurgents have been targeting many Iraqis who are seen as helping the U.S. led forces, and extremist militiamen have often targeted people in occupations seen as breaking Islamic rules.
Never in Iraq, Kana said, had a church been attacked, not since the days of the Mongols, who massacred 800000 of Baghdad's residents and destroyed the city in the 13th century.
Neshwan Mikho, 46, has been cleaning the Saint John's Church in the working class neighborhood of Bataween every Saturday for the past seven years undeterred by rain, sandstorms or even shellings.
"But today, I was afraid to go when I heard the news," she said.
She said she and her sister, Widad, 60, who lives with her, will not catch the 6:30 a.m. bus that takes them to church every Sunday.
"I am sad in my heart because tomorrow I will not be attending Mass," said Widad, a Chaldean Christian.
"They are denying us what is most important thing in our lives."
She has been living in a state of near paranoia since the August church attacks.
At night, she said, she wakes up four or five times to look out the window to make sure no one's standing outside.
"We are targets from both sides for being Iraqis like everyone else and for being Christians in particular," said Widad, a retired nurse.
She and her sister would like to leave for good for Australia, where their two other sisters live.
But they cannot afford it.
"What can we do?
They are shelling our church, they might break into our homes tomorrow and the next day force us to wear the veil," Widad said.
Bassem Samir Khouri, a legal adviser in the interim Education Ministry, will also skip Sunday mass but is staying put in Iraq.
He said throughout the years, Iraq's Christians had kept to themselves trying to keep out of trouble.
With the country in turmoil now, Muslims are asking why the Christians aren't taking sides on the question of Fallujah or other trouble spots where anti American insurgency is strong.
Dana George, 60, would like to leave the country if only for the sake of her three grown children.
But her husband won't hear of it.
So for now, she will continue going to her St. Matthew's Church despite the attacks.
She feels indebted to God for protecting her and her family all those difficult years under Saddam.
"Now I feel it's my duty to pay him back," she said.
Samaan said Christians are vulnerable in predominantly Muslim Iraq.
"There's nobody to help us.
Muslims have the support of their tribe.
The Pope is our only power, but doesn't help us," she said.
She said she would like to leave Iraq for good.
Where would she like to go?
"Anywhere out of the Arab world where they all think we are infidels," she said.
The former archbishop of Canterbury launched a campaign Monday to assure the future of Iraq's Assyrian community, which he said is facing persecution.
George Carey said the Assyrians were the victims of systematic ethnic cleansing, which had worsened considerably since the fall of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
The mainly Christian community has faced relentless persecution for hundreds of years from the largely Muslim population living alongside them.
"In recent months and years churches and monasteries have been attacked and people have been killed," said Carey, who launched the campaign with Assyrian leaders at the House of Lords.
"In one case a young man was kidnapped and beheaded.
We are talking about terrible atrocities, which would undermine any community," he said.
"These are issues of human rights and abuse of people which we have to be aware of.
"It is systematic violence against Assyrian people, driving them out of their homes and pillaging them.
It is putting pressure upon them to get them to leave."
Carey said the Assyrians were also seen as an easy target because they are Christians in a mainly Muslim country.
The Assyrian civilization, which has existed since 3000 B.C., has one of the oldest Christian traditions in the world, dating to the first century.
There are 800000 Assyrians in Iraq and there are thought to be around half a million living around the world.
They still speak the ancient biblical language of Aramaic.
Carey stressed that the campaign to ensure their future is "not a strategy against Islam."
This is simply to say that the Assyrians are now the victims of terrorists and the imprint of others who want to put their very narrow world view upon others.
We must fight it."
Campaign organizer Mark Seddon called for Assyrian rights to be enshrined in the new Iraqi constitution and for Assyrians dispossessed by the violence to be given the financial aid to return to their lands and homes.
The Rev. Doctor Khoshaba George, who runs an Assyrian church in London, said the community's hopes of a brighter future had been raised with the fall of Saddam.
"Unfortunately things went wrong and our condition in Iraq is becoming worse and worse," he added.
Iraq's 25.4 million people include ethnic Arabs, Kurds and Turks and are religiously split among the Sunni and Shiite branches of Islam.
Iraq, the largest Arab country with a Shiite majority, also has a tiny Christian minority, most of its Jewish population was expelled after Israel's establishment.
Here is a look at its ethnic and religious makeup.
ETHNIC DIVIDES ARABS: Accounting for perhaps 80 percent of the population, they are largely Muslim divided among Sunnis and Shiites.
KURDS: A Kurdish minority that accounts for up to 20 percent of the population is predominantly Sunni Muslim.
Kurds want to protect gains made during the years of self rule following the 1991 Gulf War, including the establishment of some democratic institutions.
Though Kurdish leaders say they only seek autonomy, many Kurds harbor aspirations for independence.
Thousands of Kurds were killed when Saddam Hussein's forces gassed the town of Halabja in 1988.
OTHERS: Ethnic Turks as well as Assyrians belonging to the Chaldean Assyrian church, the main Christian sect in Iraq, are tiny minorities, with Turkmens concentrated in parts of northern Iraq.
Ethnic Turks, displaced by Saddam from oil rich provinces in the past, seek to maintain their strength in the northern oil town of Kirkuk.
RELIGIOUS DIVIDES: SHIITE MUSLIMS: Estimated at about 60 percent of the country's population, they are largely Arab but some ethnic Kurds also follow the Shia branch of Islam.
The cities of Najaf and Karbala are the center of Iraqi Shiite's religious authority.
Shiites, whose split with Sunni Muslims dates back to a centuries old rift over who was the proper successor to Islam's founding Prophet Muhammad, long were repressed by Saddam's regime.
Many Arab and Western countries worry a strong Shiite showing in Jan 30 elections will push Iraq closer to non Arab Iran, which is governed by Shiite clerics.
SUNNI MUSLIMS: Estimated at more than 30 percent of the population, including most Kurds.
Since independence, Iraq has been ruled by the Sunni minority, which is wary of the power democratic elections likely would give Shiites.
Many Sunni leaders want the Jan 30 vote postponed, and militant Sunni clerics have called for a boycott.
An area known as the Sunni triangle west and north of Baghdad has been a stronghold for Iraqi insurgents battling U.S. occupation and the interim Iraqi government they consider American puppets.
CHRISTIANS: About 3 percent of the population, most belong to the Chaldean Assyrian church.
Many Christians have fled Iraq, fearing the Islamic insurgency.
More than 1500 members of an Iraqi Christian group have gone to northern Iraq to try to protect Christians following attacks on churches in Baghdad and Mosul, the leader of the group said Saturday.
In an interview, Yonadem Kana, the leader of the Assyrian Democratic Movement in Iraq and a member of the Iraqi National Council, said the fighters have been deployed in Baghdida near the northern city of Mosul.
"We do not want to transform our movement into a militia," he said.
"But if needed, we can arm more than 10000 people."
Christians make up just 3 percent of Iraq's population of about 25 million.
The major Christian groups include Chaldean Assyrians, who make up Kana's group, and Armenians.
On Oct 16, bomb attacks targeted five churches in Baghdad which damaged buildings but caused no casualties.
Officials estimate that as many as 15000 of Iraq's nearly one million Christians have left the country since August, when four churches in Baghdad and one in Mosul were attacked in a coordinated series of car bombings.
The attacks killed 12 people and injured 61 others.
Another church was bombed in Baghdad in September.
Islamic militants have told Christian owners of liquor stores to close down their businesses, and they have threatened Christians who run beauty salons and shops selling fashionable clothes.
Kana, who is on a three day visit to Syria for talks on Iraq's security, said his movement will not station fighters in other Iraqi cities.
In Baghdad, he said, "we have the cover of law and Iraqi regular army and security forces."
Kana said his movement does not need to be protected by U.S. led coalition forces.
"We will not accept that our people's ethnic and religious background be used as a card in the hands of foreign forces to interfere in Iraq and to prolong the occupation," Kana said.
He said he will attend a meeting in Jordan on Monday to discuss ways to stabilize Iraq ahead of the Jan 30 elections.
Delegates from 18 Iraqi factions and U.N. experts will attend.
Gumen kidnapped a Catholic archbishop in Iraq's main northern city of Mosul Monday in what the Vatican condemned as a "terrorist act" as persistent violence dogged the run up to landmark January 30 elections.
Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh said his US backed interim government was "prepared for the worst" as insurgent attacks killed dozens of people in the space of 48 hours.
Archbishop Basile Georges Casmoussa, 66, leader of Mosul's Syrian Catholic community, was seized by gunmen at around 5 pm (1400 GMT) as he was about to enter his car, local priest Father Faraj told AFP.
The kidnappers then tossed him into the trunk of their vehicle before speeding away, said the priest, who follows the rival Chaldean rite.
The Chaldean patriarch in Baghdad, Emmanuel Delly, said Casmoussa "was abducted outside his home as he was returning from a pastoral visit in the diocese of Mosul".
"He was abducted and taken off in a car.
We don't know who took him, nor the reason why," Delly told the missionary news agency Misna by telephone.
"We gave the news to the Vatican and now we are doing everything possible to trace him and we hope we can save him."
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls said the Holy See "condemns in the firmest manner this terrorist act and demands that Monsignor Casmoussa be rapidly returned safe and well to his ministry".
The motive of the abuction was not immediately clear but it came amid mounting sectarian violence in the run up to this month's election.
The home of the Chaldean patriarch was attacked late last year prompting condemnation from Pope John Paul II.
In Baghdad, a spokesman for one of the main Christian political parties suggested the abuction might be an attempt to intimidate the community into staying at home on polling day.
"It could be an attack on Christians who are willing to participate in the elections," said Assyrian Democratic Movement spokesman William Warda.
Iraq's fledgling security forces, which are to take the lead role on polling day, took the brunt of a flurry of attacks around Iraq on Monday.
North of Baghdad, some 20 rebels ambushed an army checkpoint near Baquba, sprayed gunfire and lobbed rocket propelled grenades, killing seven soldiers and a security guard, army officers told AFP.
A soldier was knelt in morning prayer in a tiny sentry post when insurgents came up from behind and decapitated him.
Another three were burnt to death in a vehicle, the officers said.
The killings came after the Iraqi army arrested around 60 people in sweeps in the town of Bohrouz, south of Baquba, where the insurgency has popular support, said local resident Akeel Mateb.
The Al Qaeda linked group of Iraq's most wanted man Abu Musab al Zarqawi claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on the Internet.
In another attack, seven policemen were killed and 15 wounded in a suicide bombing outside a police station in Baiji, home to Iraq's largest oil refinery, a senior police officer said.
In the village of Al Dawr, just outside Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, one officer was killed and another wounded, police said.
In Al Shurqat, south of Mosul, one policeman was killed and two wounded in another attack on a police station, while the body of a second officer was found riddled with bullets on a roadside.
Amid the violence, the deputy prime minister acknowledged that polling day was likely to be mired in violence but argued an "imperfect" poll was better than none at all.
"I hope elections will go smoothly but we are prepared for the worst," Saleh told AFP.
The top US commander in Iraq, General George W. Casey, gave a similarly gloomy prognosis, saying that election day violence was unavoidable despite the coalition's best efforts.
With much riding on their performance, Iraqi security forces went on the offensive, killing 35 rebels and arresting 64 in the space of 48 hours in the formerly rebel held city of Fallujah, west of Baghdad, the government said.
West of Fallujah, a suicide bomber blew up a vehicle packed with explosives in the city of Ramadi, causing US casualties, a marine spokesman said without elaborating.
Two beheaded corpses of Iraqi soldiers were also found in the city, security sources said.
In Mosul, the US military said it had killed seven insurgents in the space of 24 hours.
Outside Iraq, members of the country's huge emigre community began registering for this month's election in 14 countries around the globe in what organisers hailed as one of the largest operations of its kind.
Armed men kidnapped a Catholic archbishop in Iraq's main northern city of Mosul Monday, a local priest said, prompting denunciations from the Vatican of what it called a "terrorist act".
Archbishop Basil George Casmusa, 66, leader of the city's Syrian Catholic community, was seized by gunmen at around 5 pm (1400 GMT) as he was about to enter his car, Father Faraj told AFP.
The kidnappers then tossed him into the trunk of their vehicle before speeding away, said the priest, who follows the rival Chaldean rite.
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls said the Holy See "condemns in the firmest manner this terrorist act and demands that Monsignor Casmusa be rapidly returned safe and well to his ministry".
The prelate heads the 35000 strong Syrian Catholic church in Mosul.
All of Iraq's Christian denominations Assyrian, Syrian, Armenian and Greek have wings which recognize the supremacy of the Holy See.
Pope John Paul II, who named Casmusa archbishop in 1999, late last year condemned attacks on Catholic churches in Mosul, including an attack on the home of the leader of the Chaldean community the Catholic breakaway from the Assyrian Church.
The kidnapping of a Catholic bishop in Mosul last week is a sad reminder of the once robust but rapidly diminishing Christian community in Iraq.
Insurgents abducted Syrian Catholic Archbishop Basile Casmoussa apparently to frighten Iraqi Christians.
They wanted to discourage Christians from voting on Sunday, according to Iraqi bishop, Louis Sako of Kirkuk.
Both bishops are members of a branch of the Roman Catholic Church and one of several small, eclectic church groups in the country.
Christians flourished in Iraq long before anyone, anywhere was Muslim.
The advent of Islam in the seventh century began the decline of Christianity in the Middle East.
Many are now migrating from the war torn country.
Numbers are hard to verify, but there are significantly fewer than two million Christians among the 24 million Iraqis today.
The story of Christianity in and around Iraq is a mixture of history and myth but certainly began in the very early days of the faith.
St. Thaddaeus generally gets credit for bringing the new faith to Assyrians living throughout Mesopotamia, the vast area that is now part of Iraq, Iran and Syria.
Thaddaeus, however, has a murky history.
He is also known as the Apostle Jude, the brother of James and author of the New Testament letter of Jude.
Thaddaeus is at times linked to a St. Addai who was a missionary to Mesopotamia in the second century.
St. Thomas the apostle, Sts. Mari and Aggai are also honored as founders of the faith among the Iraqi people.
In any event, Christianity in Iraq, through what is known as the Assyrian Church of the East, took root very shortly after the faith was born.
The language of liturgy there was and, in some cases, remains Aramaic, the tongue Jesus spoke.
By the 16th century, the Assyrian Church, long splintering, began to take its present shape.
Some groups remained loyal to the Orthodox tradition, while others, such as the Chaldean Catholic Church, professed loyalty to the Catholic church in the West.
Protestants also began to gain a foothold .
The Syrian Catholic Church of which the kidnapped bishop is a member has a significant presence in Iraq.
That community traces its roots to the church in Antioch, Syria, where, the Bible says, followers of Christ were first called Christian.
It was united with the Roman Catholic Church in 1871.
Christians in Iraq have a rich, ancient and complex history.
Sadly, they may not have a future.

Two churches in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul came under simultaneous attack on Tuesday, witnesses and clerics said, but there were no immediate reports of casualties.
Gunmen stormed into the city's Chaldean and Armenian churches in the latest attacks on Iraq's minority Christian community, they said.
"Gunmen entered the church at about 4:30 pm (1330 GMT).
They gathered those present in one room and planted explosive charges in different parts of the building," said Father Raghid Aziz Kara at the Chaldean church.
"We were then taken outside and the armed men set off the devices.
We heard three blasts," he told AFP outside the church which was set ablaze.
At the same moment, gunmen attacked an Armenian church, forcing out a security guard and two other people inside the building, the guard said, adding: "I heard two explosions."
The Chaldean church, one of the largest in Mosul, was built in the 1950s and enlarged four decades later.
The Chaldeans, whose 600000 people represent the majority of Christians in Iraq, are an oriental rite Catholic community.
Armenian Christians in Iraq number only a few thousand.
On November 8, at least three people were killed and 45 wounded when two suspected car bombs exploded within minutes of each other outside two churches in southern Baghdad.
In a coordinated assault on August 1, six car bombs killed 10 people and injured 50 others outside churches in Baghdad and Mosul.
Iraq's Christian parties complain they lack funding and are living in danger ahead of landmark parliamentary elections scheduled for January 30.
Already the victims of several church bombings since August, the country's 700000 Christians, who make up just three percent of Iraq's 26 million people, are struggling to get their message across.
"Governmental parties are able to reach out to the public through the media because they have greater financial resources," says Odeesho Toma, a member of the Assyrian Patriotic Party, which is running on a coalition list with Kurdish parties.
Because of its lack of financial clout, the party's Shara (the Truth) radio broadcasts in Kurdistan, but its frequency has trouble making it to Baghdad.
"We have to hold meetings and symposiums for our people in the north to urge them to vote for the list we are part of," Toma says.
Even for parties with deeper pockets, like the Assyrian Democratic Movement, television advertising is too costly.
"We are facing financial troubles, and huge amounts of money are required if we want to make use of satellite TV stations in our campaign," says William Warda, the head of the culture and information bureau in the Assyrian Democratic Movement.
"Considering the fact that members of the next parliament will only keep their posts for no longer than 11 months, it's not worth spending all that money," he adds.
The few posters of Christian parties on display bear no symbols other than the map of Iraq.
"For a prosperous Iraq for the unity of our Chaldean Syriac Assyrian people, vote for list number 148 of the Democratic Coalition of the Two Rivers", one poster reads.
Another poster shows Iraq's map in white and the ancient symbol of a sun engulfing a star and two rivers springing near the northern, restive, city of Mosul in tribute to the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers.
Unlike big governmental partithan one million.
Some television stations run by Christian parties are working from abroad and apparently addressing Iraqi Christian communities there, like the Surayah TV of the Bethnarhain Patriotic Union based in Stockholm, Sweden and Assyrians based in Chicago.
Six weeks after a White House aide was indicted in the CIA leak case, special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald was back at work Wednesday before another grand jury with top presidential political adviser Karl Rove still under investigation.
Fitzgerald did not comment on the nearly three hour grand jury session where the prosecutor was accompanied by three deputies and an FBI agent.
Rove, one of President George W. Bush's most powerful advisers, has been noticeably at Bush's side this week after weeks of avoiding many public appearances with the president.
A renewal of interest in the case would threaten to derail Bush's efforts to overcome some of the lowest approval ratings of his presidency, dragged down by a public uproar over the CIA leak investigation as well as the unpopular war in Iraq and the administration's fumbling of Hurricane Katrina relief.
In the last grand jury activity in the leak probe, on Oct 28, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, a top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, was indicted on five counts of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to the FBI.
Libby resigned and has pleaded not guilty.
For nearly two years, Fitzgerald has been looking into who leaked the identity of covert CIA officer Valerie Plame to the news media.
Plame's identity was disclosed eight days after her husband, former U.S. ambassador Joseph Wilson, publicly accused the administration of twisting intelligence to exaggerate the Iraqi threat in the run up to the war.
Rove was not indicted, but Fitzgerald made clear at the time of the Libby indictment that his investigation is not finished.
The prosecutor underscored that point in court papers last month, saying that the probe continues and will involve proceedings before a different grand jury.
The first grand jury term expired the day it indicted Libby.
Rove's legal problems stem from the fact that it was not until more than a year into the criminal investigation that he told the prosecutor about disclosing the CIA status of Wilson's wife to Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper on July 11, 2003.
Rove says he had forgotten the Cooper conversation, which occurred days before Plame's identity was revealed by conservative columnist Robert Novak.
The presidential adviser revealed the CIA employment of Wilson's wife to Cooper two days after the presidential aide and Novak discussed Plame's CIA status.
The Justice Department launched the criminal investigation 2 1/2 months later, prompting the White House to insist that neither Rove nor Libby had been involved in leaking Plame's identity.
Indicted former top White House aide I. Lewis 'Scooter' Libby will argue that Vice President Dick Cheney authorized him to leak classified information in 2003 to bolster the case for the US led war against Iraq, US news media reported late Thursday.
Libby, who has been charged in a federal investigation into the outing of a CIA agent, will in part base his defense on the claim that Cheney had encouraged him to share classified information with reporters, NBC television news said, citing sources familiar with the case.
Libby's attorneys discussed Cheney's authorization with federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald and the judge handling the case in a recent teleconference call, NBC News reported, The online edition of the magazine National Journal reported that Libby had testified to a federal grand jury that Cheney and other White House "superiors" had "authorized" him in mid 2003 to leak classified information to defend the administration's prewar intelligence assertions in making the case to go to war with Iraq.
The magazine quoted attorneys familiar with the matter and court records as sources.
Libby also argued that Cheney authorized him to release details of the classified National Intelligence Estimate, the magazine reported, citing sources with firsthand knowledge.
Libby, Cheney's former chief of staff, denies charges of obstruction of justice, perjury and making false statements in an intrigue bound up in the US drive to war with Iraq.
His trial will be held in January 2007, after November's crucial mid term US elections.
The case arose from a federal probe into the outing of Central Intelligence Agency spy Valerie Plame, during the run up to the Iraq war in 2003.
Critics charge that senior US officials deliberately blew Plame's cover to punish her husband, ex diplomat Joseph Wilson, for criticising the White House's rationale for war.
Both NBC and the National Journal say that much of Libby's defense will be based on Cheney's alleged authorization to discuss the documents.
The president's top political guru, Karl Rove, is still under investigation over the leaking of Plame's name.
Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald is disputing the claim of Vice President Dick Cheney's former top aide that the prosecutor lacked the legal authority to indict him in the CIA leak investigation.
Fitzgerald opposed the request by I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby that a judge dismiss the five count indictment against him in the Valerie Plame affair.
In court papers, the prosecutor argued that being allowed to operate outside any control of the U.S. Justice Department is constitutional and in accordance with federal law.
The prosecutor, investigating the disclosure of Plame's CIA undercover status, is not supervised by the Justice Department and he is not required to inform anyone at the department about the investigation's progress.
In a court filing in February, Libby said that only Congress could approve such an arrangement.
"The attorney general may delegate powers, but he may not abdicate responsibility," Libby's lawyers wrote.
Fitzgerald replied that the attorney general has been granted broad legal authority by Congress "to delegate any of his functions to other offices of the Department of Justice."
Fitzgerald is the U.S. attorney in Chicago.
He was appointed in December 2003 by then Deputy Attorney General James Comey.
John Ashcroft, the attorney general at the time, disqualified himself from the matter because of potential conflict of interest.
Fitzgerald obtained an indictment of Libby on five counts of perjury, obstruction and lying to the FBI.
Vice President Dick Cheney's former top aide, indicted last month on perjury and obstruction charges, reviewed documents Wednesday at a federal courthouse.
Accompanied by his legal team, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby walked into the courthouse without the crutches that he'd been using during a court appearance two weeks ago when he pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from the CIA leak investigation.
Libby's visit to the courthouse came hours The Washington Post reported that at least one senior Bush administration official who was not identified told editor Bob Woodward about CIA operative Valerie Plame about a month before her identity was publicly exposed.
The newspaper reported that Woodward told prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald, who is investigating the leak of Plame's identity, that the official talked to him about Plame in mid June 2003.
Woodward and editors at the Post refused to identify the official to reporters other than to say it was not Libby.
Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Karl Rove's legal team, said Rove was not the official who talked to Woodward.
Rove is a top deputy to President George W. Bush and was referred to, but not by name, in Libby's indictment, as having discussed Plame's identity with reporters.
Libby was indicted last month on one charge of obstruction of justice and two counts each of false statement and perjury in connection with Fitzgerald's investigation.
Plame's husband, former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson, had criticized U.S. intelligence efforts before the Iraq war.
On June 23, Libby told New York Times reporter Judith Miller that Wilson's wife might work at the Central Intelligence Agency.
Robert Novak, in a column published July 14, identified Plame, as a CIA operative.
Woodward's testimony in a two hour deposition Monday would mean that another White House official told a reporter about Plame before Libby revealed her identity to Miller.
William Jeffress Jr., one of Libby's lawyers, told the Post that Woodward's testimony raises questions about his client's indictment.
"Will Mr Fitzgerald now say he was wrong to say on TV that Scooter Libby was the first official to give this information to a reporter?"
Jeffress said.
Woodward, famous for his investigation with Carl Bernstein of the Watergate scandal during the Nixon administration, is now assistant managing editor of the Post.
In October, he was dismissive of the outing of Plame, telling CNN television's Larry King that the damage from her exposure was "quite minimal."
On Wednesday, Woodward apologized for not telling his boss, Washington Post's executive editor Leonard Downie Jr., about his being among the journalists who were told about Plame's identity, even as the investigation morphed into a national scandal.
Woodward held back the information because he wanted to protect his sources and because was worried about being subpoenaed in the inquiry, according to the newspaper's Web site.
"I hunkered down.
I'm in the habit of keeping secrets," Woodward said.
"I didn't want anything out there that was going to get me subpoenaed."
Meanwhile, The Associated Press on Wednesday joined other news organizations in asking U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton to deny a court motion by Fitzgerald for a blanket protective order keeping all pretrial evidence in Libby's case out of public view.
The special prosecutor is seeking a court order that would prohibit Libby and his legal team from publicly disclosing "all materials produced by the government."
WASHINGTON Sen Charles Schumer, D N.Y., called on President Bush Wednesday to reveal who leaked the name of a CIA operative to the press after reports that columnist Robert Novak said he is "confident the president knows who the source is."
A special prosecutor has been probing whether administration officials leaked the name of CIA agent Valerie Plame to Novak and others in an organized effort to retaliate against her husband, administration critic Joseph Wilson.
As a covert officer, Plame is protected under a statute that makes it a crime under certain circumstances to reveal her identity.
"In keeping with your stated desire to root out leaks, I urge you to share with the American people whatever knowledge you have about which senior administration officials were responsible for disclosing Ms Plame's identity as a CIA operative," Schumer wrote Bush in a letter.
The White House would not discuss the letter, saying its policy is to not comment on the leak while it is under investigation.
The investigation has led to the indictment of Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, on charges of perjury, making false statements and obstructing justice in the case.
Libby pleaded not guilty, setting the stage for a high profile trial.
Bush's closest political adviser, Karl Rove, is still under investigation in the matter and has testified four times before a federal grand jury.
White House officials flatly denied two years ago that he and Libby had any involvement in outing the identity of Plame.
Novak first identified Plame as a CIA operative in a newspaper column on July 14, 2003, attributing the information to administration officials.
Eight days earlier, Wilson had written an opinion piece in The New York Times that suggested that the administration manipulated intelligence on the Iraqi weapons program to justify going to war.
Novak has never revealed his sources publicly.
According to the Raleigh News and Observer, Novak on Tuesday told a luncheon sponsored by the John Locke Foundation, a conservative think tank, "I'm confident the president knows who the source is,I'd be amazed if he doesn't."
In addition, he said, "Don't bug me,Bug the president as to whether he should reveal who the source is."
Novak also said his role in the Plame affair "snowballed out of proportion" as a result of a "campaign by the left."
But he also blamed "extremely bad management of the issue by the White House."
"Once you give an issue to a special prosecutor, you lose control of it," he said, according to the newspaper.

Valerie Plame, the spy whose outing sparked a major scandal and the indictment of a top White House official, is leaving the CIA, the Los Angeles Times said Tuesday.
Plame's undercover work at the Central Intelligence Agency was revealed in the US media shortly after her husband, former US diplomat Joseph Wilson, publicly criticized the US rationale for going to war with Iraq in 2003.
Plame, 42, is a specialist in weapons of mass destruction.
Friends said she would be spending more time in the future with her family, including her five year old twins, the newspaper reported.
After her outing, "she did not have a career left," Larry Johnson, a former CIA officer and a friend of Plame, told the Times.
"She was no longer able to work as a clandestine officer, which was her reason for being."
The CIA, contacted by AFP, refused to comment.
Plame has been silent since the onset of the scandal but allowed herself to be photographed for the magazine Vanity Fair, which showed her seated beside her husband in a convertible, mysterious in a scarf and dark glasses.
A two year probe into who illegally leaked Plame's identity landed one journalist in jail for 85 days for refusing to divulge her source, and toppled a top White House official.
Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff I. Lewis 'Scooter' Libby was charged with five counts of obstruction of justice, perjury and making false statements, arising from the probe.
Libby pleaded not guilty to the charges and resigned his White House job to fight them.
Meanwhile, the lawyer for Karl Rove, President George W. Bush's chief political aide, said Rove has been told he is still under investigation over the leak of Plame's identity.
Court documents released Friday provide new details about the testimony that Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff gave to a grand jury investigating his conversations with reporters and administration officials about a CIA operative.
The documents say Lewis "Scooter" Libby denied in his testimony ever mentioning CIA operative Valerie Plame to former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer or former New York Times reporter Judith Miller in separate conversations he had with them in July 2003, and further never disclosed talking to Miller about Plame in June 2003.
Libby was indicted in October on five counts of perjury, making false statements and obstruction of justice in the course of Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald's investigation into the leak of Plame's identity to the media.
The indictment charges that Libby lied to investigators when he said he did not provide information about Plame to two reporters and when he said he learned about Plame from a third, NBC's Tim Russert.
Libby has pleaded not guilty to the charges and a judge Friday set his trial for January.
The information about Libby and other individuals' secret grand jury testimony is included in sections of a once sealed federal court opinion, portions of which the court made public Friday.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that because Libby had been indicted, much of the material in the opinion that dealt with the grand jury investigation no longer needed to be kept secret.
However, some of the details of the testimony reveal many more insights into the case than Fitzgerald shared in his formal indictment of Libby or in a news conference announcing the charges.
Miller testified last year that Libby first mentioned Plame to her in a conversation in late June 2003 when she visited his office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, and they discussed her again on July 8 and July 12.
Fleischer testified that at a lunch with Libby in July 2003, Libby relayed to him "on the q.t." that former ambassador Joseph Wilson's wife worked at the CIA and sent Wilson on a fact finding trip to Niger.
Fleischer told the grand jury that he thought the lunch was "kinda weird" because Libby was normally "tight lipped" and not so chummy that he would share such confidences with the press secretary.
The papers reveal that Libby said he never discussed Wilson's wife with Fleischer.
Also, Fitzgerald thought in February 2005 about a year into his investigation of the leak of Plame's name that charging Libby with a leak was "off the table" without other evidence, the court record says.
He stressed to the circuit court that it was essential, however, to question journalists such as Miller before concluding whether Libby had violated federal laws barring the release of the identity of intelligence agents.
Fitzgerald began investigating in early 2004 whether administration officials broke the law and leaked information about Plame as retaliation.
Her name and CIA role appeared in a July 2003 syndicated column by Robert D. Novak eight days after Wilson publicly criticized the Bush administration's justification for waging war with Iraq.
A federal judge on Friday ordered the government to provide I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby redacted versions of documents he reviewed or information he requested during highly classified morning intelligence briefings while he was chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney.
Libby, who has been indicted on charges of perjury, making false statements and obstructing justice in the CIA leak case, originally sought a wide range of the CIA's most sensitive intelligence reports to bolster his defense.
Libby's lawyers have said they plan to argue that Libby was so preoccupied with other pressing issues such as those discussed at the top secret morning briefings that he simply forgot conversations he had with reporters and government officials about CIA officer Valerie Plame.
U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said in Friday's decision that the government must provide edited versions of intelligence material also viewed by Cheney in morning briefings and a list, by topic only, of information requests Libby made during those top secret meetings.
Walton said that if the government cannot produce redacted copies of the documents in question that a list of general topic areas discussed each day would suffice.
He said the material is relevant to Libby's "preoccupation defense."
"The Court has painstakingly endeavored to ensure that the defendant is provided with the information he truly needs to prepare his defense based upon what he represented through counsel will be his theory of why he should not be held culpable for the offenses charged in the indictment," Walton wrote.
The charges against Libby grew out of the investigation by special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald into whether any top administration officials knowingly disclosed Plame's identity to discredit allegations made by her husband, former ambassador Joseph Wilson.
Libby originally asked for nearly a year's worth of the documents, including the President's Daily Brief, the CIA's most sensitive intelligence report, to establish that he was dealing with life and death issues that dwarfed Plame in importance.
As the vice president's top aide, Libby sat in on the morning meetings that covered the latest intelligence reports on Iraq, North Korea, terrorist activity and other pressing national security matters.
Earlier this week, the CIA objected to providing copies of so much material, saying it would divert too much time and attention away from analysts working on other intelligence matters.
The same day, Libby scaled back his request in an effort to persaude Walton to order the agency to turn over some of the material.
As a result, the Libby defense team will be able to provide a broad overview of the former Cheney aide's hectic schedule and stressful responsibilities but not in the detail it originally sought.
In addition to limiting Libby's access to redacted copies or a list of topics, Walton said the government must only turn over documents covering a very specific set of dates.
Libby originally sought documents covering the period between May 2003 to March 2004.
Walton noted that most of what he ordered turned over to Libby will not be seen by a jury.
Classified evidence that Libby wants to use first must be approved by the judge.
Walton said the White House and CIA have until March 24, 2006, to make claims of executive privilege over the PDBs and related documents.
In the past, the White House has resisted efforts to turn over documents about private communications, arguing that it would discourage aides and advisers from providing candid advice in the future.
The fight over the classified material has delayed the Libby proceedings and prompted prosecutor Fitzgerald to charge that Libby's defense team is requesting unobtainable legal documents in an effort to derail the trial.
Lawyers for Vice President Dick Cheney's former top aide want a federal judge to dismiss I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby's indictment on grounds the special prosecutor in the CIA leak case lacked authority.
In a court filing, Libby's lawyers said his indictment violated the Constitution because Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald was not appointed by the president with the consent of the Senate.
The defense attorneys also said Fitzgerald's appointment violated federal law because his investigation was not supervised by the attorney general.
They said only Congress can approve such an arrangement.
The lawyers said illegal assignment of "unsupervised and undirected power" to Fitzgerald requires that he be relieved of his duties in the investigation and that all actions he has taken be voided.
Fitzgerald was appointed in December 2003 after former Attorney General John Ashcroft removed himself from the investigation because of his close relationships with White House officials.
Then Deputy Attorney General James Comey, acting in Ashcroft's place in the matter, selected Fitzgerald.
Comey gave Fitzgerald sweeping power to conduct the investigation into the leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity, exempting the special counsel from following rules that apply to all U.S. attorneys throughout the nation.
Unlike every other federal prosecutor, Fitzgerald did not have to seek approval from senior Justice Department officials to grant immunity or subpoena reporters and news organizations.
Nor did he have to advise senior Justice officials before he sought Libby's indictment.
"The attorney general may delegate powers but he may not abdicate responsibility," Libby's lawyers wrote.
Libby, 55, who resigned as Cheney's chief of staff after he was indicted, is charged with lying about how he learned Plame's identity and when he subsequently told reporters.
He faces five counts of perjury, false statements and obstruction of justice.
Plame's identity as a CIA operative was published by columnist Robert Novak in July 2003 after her husband, former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson, accused the administration of twisting intelligence about Iraq's efforts to buy uranium "yellowcake" in Niger.
The year before, the CIA had sent Wilson to Niger to determine the accuracy of the uranium reports.
Libby's lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton to conduct a hearing and told him he may need to require the Justice Department to turn over records including secret letters between Comey and Fitzgerald to determine whether the special counsel's appointment is legal.
Defense attorneys and Fitzgerald will appear in U.S. District Court Friday to argue over defense requests for classified records and evidence gathered by the prosecution about reporters who learned about Plame from government officials other than Libby.
Libby's trial is set for January 2007.
If the case goes to trial, defense attorneys have signaled that Libby probably will testify that he was so busy with national security issues that he forgot or incorrectly recalled conversations he had with reporters about "less important topics," such as Plame.
Attorneys for Vice President Dick Cheney's former top aide urged a court Thursday to force prosecutors to turn over all the information they obtained from reporters about their confidential conversations with Bush administration sources in the course of a two year CIA leak investigation.
Attorneys for I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby said they must cast a wide net to learn about any conversations regarding CIA operative Valerie Plame, and that the information could be crucial to Libby's defense against perjury and obstruction charges.
In court papers, the lawyers said they will probably subpoena reporters and officials later to thoroughly investigate how widely Plame's identity was known before her name appeared in the news media in July 2003.
Libby was indicted by Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald on five felony counts of lying to the FBI and a grand jury.
The indictment asserted that Libby leaked information about Plame's CIA role to two reporters but pretended he had learned the information from Tim Russert, the Washington bureau chief of NBC News, and that he passed it along as unverified reporter chatter.
The defense's goal is to show that Libby was not intentionally lying when he testified that many journalists had known about Plame during the spring and summer of 2003, and that he believed he had learned about her from Russert.
"There can be no information more material to the defense of a perjury case than information tending to show that the alleged false statements are, in fact, true or that they could be the result of mistake or confusion," the lawyers argued in their filing.
"Libby is entitled to know what the government knows."
Fitzgerald began investigating in early 2004 whether administration officials broke the law and leaked information about Plame as retaliation.
Her name and CIA role appeared in a July 2003 syndicated column by Robert Novak eight days after Plame's husband, former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV, publicly criticized the Bush administration's justification for waging war with Iraq.
The defense effort to delve deeper into Fitzgerald's investigation, if successful, could divulge the identities of some anonymous, high level government sources whom reporters and news organizations have spent years and millions of dollars in legal fees protecting from public view.
The defense strategy is expected to pull several high profile Washington journalists into a legal battle over the First Amendment, many of them for a second time.
The court papers specifically asked U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton to have Fitzgerald turn over all documents showing knowledge by other reporters of Plame's CIA role or her husband's mission to investigate claims that Iraq was trying to obtain from Niger materials for a nuclear program, and any subpoenas or agreements with other reporters who provided information to the investigation.
Fitzgerald has asserted that Libby is not entitled to information about all the reporters questioned in the investigation if the government does not expect to use their information or call them as witnesses in Libby's trial, the filings said.
But the court papers filed by Libby's team highlighted Bob Woodward, a Washington Post reporter and assistant managing editor, as a crucial witness who could provide exculpatory information that might help Libby avoid a conviction.
Woodward revealed in November, a few weeks after Libby was indicted, that another administration source not Libby had told him in a "casual" and "offhand" way about Plame's CIA role.
Woodward testified that this conversation took place before Libby is believed to have first provided information about Plame to Judith Miller, then a New York Times reporter.
Woodward, who has repeatedly said he has not been released to identify his source, declined to comment Thursday.
Washington Post attorney Mary Ann Werner said the newspaper continues to consider its promises of anonymity to sources sacred and vital to some kinds of newsgathering.
"Protecting our confidential sources has been our highest priority throughout this investigation, and it remains our highest priority today," Werner said.
The court papers also mentioned an interest in questioning NBC News reporter Andrea Mitchell, who suggested in an October 2003 news program that it was "common knowledge" among some intelligence reporters that Plame worked at the CIA, and Washington Post reporter Walter Pincus, who allegedly learned about Plame from another unidentified source in 2003.
Charles Tobin, a media lawyer in Washington, said the move by Libby's defense was expected and is the result of Fitzgerald's aggressive insistence on deposing journalists and forcing them under threat of jail to reveal confidential sources.
"I think we could have expected that, when the prosecutor went on a fishing expedition, that the fish he caught would want to look back in the pail," Tobin said.
"The more this case develops, the further we seem to be getting from the core issues of the indictment and more into the business of journalism and how news gets put out in this town."
US Vice President Dick Cheney was linked to a case involving a leak to journalists of an undercover CIA agent's identity, according to a report Monday in the New York Times.
The report on the newspaper's website, citing lawyers involved in the case, said that notes taken by I. Lewis Libby, Cheney's chief of staff who has been questioned in the investigation of the leak, show that Libby learned of the identity of the agent from the vice president.
The notes appear to contradict Libby's testimony to a federal grand jury that he initially learned about Valerie Wilson, also known by her maiden name as Valerie Plame, from journalists, the Times said.
A special prosecutor and a grand jury are investigating the disclosure of her identity, allegedly in retaliation for critical comments made to the media by her husband, former ambassador Joseph Wilson, which contradicted one of US President George W. Bush's justifications for waging war against Iraq.
In some cases revealing the name of a covert CIA agent can be a federal crime.
The Times reported lawyers as saying that Libby's notes show that Cheney mentioned Plame's identity to Libby on June 12, 2003, about one month before her identity was revealed by a newspaper columnist, Robert Novak, citing senior administration sources.
"Mr Libby's notes indicate that Mr Cheney had gotten his information about Ms Wilson from George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, in response to questions from the vice president about Mr Wilson," the Times said.
"But they contain no suggestion that either Mr Cheney or Mr Libby knew at the time of Ms Wilson's undercover status or that her identity was classified," it said.
Vice President Cheney's chief of staff discussed with New York Times correspondent Judith Miller the fact that the wife of a White House critic worked for the CIA on as many as three occasions before the woman, Valerie Plame, was publicly identified, according to a Times account published Sunday.
During two of the 2003 conversations with I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Miller said, she wrote versions of Plame's name in her notebook, although in one of these she believes the name came from another confidential source she said she cannot recall.
In a disclosure that could figure in special prosecutor Patrick J. Fitzgerald's investigation, Miller said she initially refused to testify about her discussions with Libby because she believed he was signaling her that she should not cooperate in the CIA leak investigation unless her account would clear him.
Miller said her lawyer Floyd Abrams told her that Libby's attorney, Joseph Tate, had related part of Libby's grand jury testimony and was "pressing about what you would say.
When I wouldn't give him an assurance that you would exonerate Libby, if you were to cooperate, he then immediately gave me this, 'Don't go there,' or 'We don't want you there.'
" Tate strongly denied such a conversation in an e mail to the Times, calling the account "outrageous" and insisting that "I never once suggested that she should not testify.
It was just the opposite."
He did not return a phone call from The Washington Post Saturday night.
Miller was jailed for 85 days for refusing to testify about Libby, until she reached an accommodation last month with Fitzgerald.
Fitzgerald has been investigating whether any administration officials including Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove, who testified for a fourth time Friday broke the law by disclosing the identity of a covert CIA operative.
Lawyers involved in the case have said they believe he is investigating other potential crimes, such as whether there was a conspiracy in the administration to discredit Plame's husband and White House critic, former ambassador Joseph Wilson IV.
A grand jury examining the issue expires on Oct 28.
Libby, though little known to the public, was a major supporter of the Iraq war and wields great influence on foreign policy and other issues within the administration.
In the first on the record account of what she told a federal grand jury in two recent appearances, Miller described a meeting on June 23, 2003, with Libby in the Old Executive Office Building.
She said her notes leave open the possibility that Libby told her Wilson's wife might work at the CIA.
"Wife works at bureau?" the notes say.
This conversation for which Miller only recently found her notes occurred when Wilson had not yet gone public with his criticism that President Bush had exaggerated evidence that Iraq was seeking weapons of mass destruction.
During that encounter, Miller said in the Times, Libby was angry about reports that Cheney and other senior officials had embraced flimsy evidence about Iraq seeking nuclear material in the African nation of Niger and was concerned about "selective leaking" by the CIA to distance the agency if no illegal Iraqi weapons were found.
Libby noted that the CIA had sent a "clandestine guy" a reference to Wilson to Niger on a fact finding mission.
On July 8, 2003 two days after Wilson published a denunciation of the White House on the weapons issue Miller had breakfast with Libby at the St. Regis Hotel.
Miller said Libby told her that Wilson's wife worked for a CIA bureau called Winpac, for weapons intelligence, nonproliferation and arms control.
Miller said she testified, however, that Libby did not refer to Plame by name or mention her covert status.
Her notebook from that day includes the notation "Valerie Flame," but she says the name appeared in a different section of the notebook from her Libby interview notes and that she believes it came from another source.
That raises the question of whether other administration officials discussed Plame's CIA status with Miller after Libby, by her recollection, was the first to raise it.
By the time she and Libby discussed Plame again, by phone on July 12, Miller said, she had talked about Wilson's wife her notes from that conversation refer incorrectly to "Victoria Wilson" with other unidentified sources.
Fitzgerald lost the opportunity to question Miller about these sources by agreeing, as part of the deal that led to her release from jail last month, to ask only about conversations with Libby.
It is not known precisely what Libby has told the grand jury.
A source close to the Cheney aide has said that Libby did acknowledge discussing Wilson's wife with Miller but that he never knew Plame's name or her covert status.
The probe was triggered after syndicated columnist Robert D. Novak wrote on July 14, 2003, that "two senior administration officials" had told him that Plame was a CIA operative who had helped arrange her husband's 2002 trip to Niger to investigate whether Iraq had sought to buy weapons grade uranium there.
Miller said Fitzgerald asked her before the grand jury whether Libby ever indicated that Cheney had approved of Libby's interviews with her or was aware of them.
The answer, she said, was no. By Miller's account, Fitzgerald asked during her testimony "whether I thought Mr Libby had tried to shape my testimony" through a letter he sent while she was in jail in suburban Alexandria, Va.
In the letter, Libby urged Miller to accept his waiver of the confidentiality she had promised him after initially rejecting such an offer as not fully voluntary.
"The public report of every other reporter's testimony makes clear that they did not discuss Ms Plame's name or identity with me," Libby wrote.
Miller said she testified that the wording surprised her "because it might be perceived as an effort by Mr Libby to suggest that I, too, would say we had not discussed Ms Plame's identity.
Yet my notes suggested that we had discussed her job."
Times Executive Editor Bill Keller was quoted as saying: "Judy believed Libby was afraid of her testimony.
She thought Libby had reason to be afraid of her testimony."
In retrospect, Publisher Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. told the paper: "Maybe a deal was possible earlier,If so, shame on us.
I tend to think not."
The article and accompanying first person piece by Miller, posted online Saturday and published in Sunday's editions, contain conflicting accounts of why Miller never wrote a story about the outing of Plame.
Miller told her newspaper that she "made a strong recommendation to my editor" that a story be pursued but "was told no." She would not identify the editor.
Managing Editor Jill Abramson, the Washington bureau chief at the time, said Miller never made any such recommendation.
Another possible conflict between Miller and the Times involves a Post report in fall 2003 that "two top White House officials disclosed Plame's identity to at least six Washington journalists."
Philip Taubman, who succeeded Abramson as Washington bureau chief, said he asked Miller whether she was among the six, which she denied.
Miller told him the subject of Wilson and his wife had come up in casual conversation with government officials, Taubman said, and "she had not been at the receiving end of a concerted effort, a deliberate organized effort to put out information."
One journalistic issue involves what Miller describes as her agreement to modify her description of Libby as a "senior administration official" when it came to information about Libby.
Miller said she agreed to describe Libby only as a "former Hill staffer," which is technically accurate because he once worked on Capitol Hill.
The publication follows weeks of criticism of the Times for failing to tell the full story of its reporter's involvement.
Keller said in a statement that "no other reporter drawn into this investigation has provided such a detailed report.
We're relieved that we can finally put this story in the hands of our readers, who will draw their own conclusions."
Times editors would not comment further, a spokeswoman said.
Miller, a Pulitzer Prize winner, says she went to see Libby in June 2003 as part of a team effort to examine why no illegal weapons were found in Iraq.
Libby, she said, wanted to talk about Wilson's mission to Niger.
In agreeing to testify, Miller acknowledged in the Times account, she was worried about the prospect of spending many more months in jail.
She said she decided to accept Libby's waiver after receiving his letter and asking him in a phone conversation: "Do you really want me to testify?
Are you sure you really want me to testify?"
Libby's reply was something like "absolutely," Miller said.
Miller's attorney Abrams and Times Co. lawyer George Freeman told the paper they worried that Miller's decision to testify would prompt observers to say the newspaper had caved in.
One unusual aspect of the Times account is that it acknowledges what a controversial figure Miller, 57, has been at the paper.
One former editor, Douglas Frantz, said Miller once called herself "Miss Run Amok" and said it meant "I can do whatever I want."
Her reputation suffered a "blow," the Times acknowledged, after some of her stories on whether Saddam Hussein harbored illegal weapons did not pan out.
"I told her there was unease, discomfort, unhappiness over some of the coverage," said Roger Cohen, the foreign editor at the time.
Miller conceded that "I got it totally wrong" but blamed the misinformation on her sources.
Miller would not allow the Times reporters to review her notes and would not discuss her interactions with editors, the article said.
To a remarkable degree, Miller was calling the shots on dealing with Fitzgerald's inquiry.
Keller and Sulzberger both told the paper that they did not press Miller for details of her conversations with Libby or ask to see her notes while battling Fitzgerald's subpoena in the courts.
Even after other news organizations disclosed that Libby was Miller's source, Times editors did not publish his name, discouraged some story suggestions by reporters and killed an article about Libby's role in the high profile case.
The case, which cost the Times millions of dollars in legal fees, so constrained its coverage that the paper did not name Libby as Miller's source until well after other news organizations did.
Keller said he largely ceded supervision of the story to managing editor Abramson because "it was just too awkward" for him while enmeshed in meetings about the paper's defense of Miller.
Asked what she regretted about the Times' handling of the matter, Abramson told the paper, "The entire thing."
Karl Rove, the White House deputy chief of staff, told President George W. Bush and others that he never engaged in an effort to disclose a CIA operative's identity to discredit her husband's criticism of the administration's Iraq policy, according to people with knowledge of Rove's account in the investigation.
They said Rove's denial to Bush occurred during a brief conversation in the fall of 2003, shortly after media reports revealed that Valerie Plame, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson's wife, worked as a covert CIA operative.
Those with direct knowledge of evidence gathered in the criminal investigation spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of grand jury secrecy.
Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald is wrapping up an investigation into whether Rove, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, or other presidential aides divulged Plame's identity in violation of federal law.
Besides the disclosure of Plame's identity, the investigation is examining whether presidential aides mishandled classified information, made false statements or obstructed justice.
Rove is to testify before the grand jury soon for a fourth time, although prosecutors have told him they no longer can assure he will avoid indictment.
Rove offered in July to return to the grand jury for additional testimony, and Fitzgerald accepted that offer after taking grand jury testimony from the formerly jailed New York Times reporter Judith Miller.
The discussion with Bush, along with others, was general and did not get into specifics concerning Rove's contacts with two reporters, Time magazine's Matthew Cooper and syndicated columnist Robert Novak, who wrote stories identifying Plame, the people familiar with Rove's account said.
They said Bush asked Rove to assure him he was not involved in an effort to divulge Plame's identity and punish Wilson, and the longtime confidant assured him that was so.
He answered similarly when White House press secretary Scott McClellan asked a similar question.
Robert Luskin, Rove's attorney, refused to comment Friday on specifics of the discussions with Bush but confirmed his client maintains then and now he did not engage in an effort to disclose Plame's identity.
Rove has told a grand jury he first learned of Plame's work for the CIA from news reporters and then discussed it with Novak and Cooper.
"Did Karl purposely set out to disclose Valerie Plame's identity in order to punish Joe Wilson for his criticism?
The answer is, 'No,'" Luskin said.
"That was his answer in July 2003 and in October 2003 (when he first testified).
And it remains his answer today."
"He always truthfully denied that he was ever part of any campaign to punish Joe Wilson by disclosing the identity of his wife," Luskin said.
Besides Rove's discussions with reporters, investigators also are looking into a delay in learning about Rove's contact with Cooper and an e mail between Rove and now National Security Adviser Steve Hadley that referenced the conversation.
Cooper's contact with Rove did not come up in Rove's first interview or grand jury appearance, but he volunteered the information and provided the e mail during a second grand jury appearance.
Wilson, Plame's husband, went public on July 6, 2003, with criticism of Bush administration officials, suggesting they manipulated intelligence to justify the Iraq war.
Eight days later, Novak revealed the identity of Wilson's wife, giving her maiden name, Valerie Plame, the name she used as a covert CIA officer.
Novak said his information about Wilson's wife had come from two senior administration officials.
Rove acknowledged talking to Novak about the story.
Cooper wrote a similar story a few days after also talking with Rove.
Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff and a key architect of the Iraq war, was indicted Friday on felony charges of perjury, making false statements to FBI agents and obstruction of justice for impeding the federal grand jury investigating the CIA leak case.
Within minutes of the indictment Friday afternoon, Libby resigned.
Karl Rove, President Bush's senior adviser and deputy chief of staff, was not charged with any crime in the case, but his lawyers indicated that he still could be a target of the investigation.
The five count indictment alleges that Libby lied to FBI agents on two occasions, perjured himself during two appearances before the grand jury and obstructed justice when he "knowingly and corruptly endeavored to influence, obstruct and impede" the grand jury's efforts to find out who leaked Valerie Plame's status as a CIA covert agent to reporters in the spring of 2003.
The charges carry a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and a $1.25 million fine, although legal experts say it's unlikely Libby would face such a severe penalty if convicted.
Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald said that even though Libby was not charged with violating the federal Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 which makes it a crime to disclose the identity of intelligence agents working undercover the charges against Libby were significant.
"The need to get to the bottom of what happened, and whether national security was compromised by inadvertence, by recklessness, by maliciousness is extremely important," Fitzgerald said at a packed news conference at the Justice Department in Washington, D.C. "We need to know the truth.
And anyone who would go into a grand jury and lie and obstruct and impede the investigation has committed a serious crime."
Libby, in a statement, said he planned to fight the charges.
"I have conducted my responsibilities honorably and truthfully, including with respect to this investigation," Libby said.
"It is with deep regret that I step aside from that service today.
I am confident that at the end of this process I will be completely and totally exonerated."
The indictment shook the White House, which was already reeling from the withdrawal of Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers a day earlier.
Bush flew back from a speech in Norfolk, Va., to appear on the White House's South Lawn to address the charges against Libby.
"Today I accepted the resignation of Scooter Libby," Bush said.
"Scooter has worked tirelessly on behalf of the American people and sacrificed much in the service to this country."
The president called the charges by the grand jury "serious," but he added, "each individual is presumed innocent and entitled to due process and a fair trial."
The indictment also was a personal blow to Vice President Dick Cheney.
Libby, 55, has been described as Cheney's alter ego, and the two men have been close since they worked together at the Defense Department more than a decade ago.
In a statement, Cheney said he accepted Libby's resignation reluctantly.
"Scooter Libby is one of the most capable and talented individuals I have ever known," Cheney said.
If the case comes to trial, Cheney is likely to be called to testify.
The indictment confirmed that Cheney told Libby in a meeting on June 12, 2003, that Plame worked for the CIA in the counterproliferation division information the vice president learned from the CIA.
While the White House was relieved that Rove was not indicted, the prospect of a criminal trial for Libby poses a serious threat to the Bush administration: exposing secretive discussions by top officials before and during the Iraq war.
The case also could put a spotlight on the long running feud between Cheney's office and the CIA over intelligence on the possibility of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that was used to justify the 2003 invasion.
"This should have been played out in congressional hearings to delve into the reasons for going to war," former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova said on CNN.
"Now we are going to have this played out in a criminal trial, which is not a good way to discuss public policy, but it's going to happen."
Fitzgerald's two year investigation focused on whether Bush administration officials deliberately leaked Plame's identity in July 2003 to retaliate against her husband, former U.S. ambassador Joseph Wilson, who had recently returned from a trip to Niger to assess reports that Iraq had tried to buy yellowcake uranium.
Wilson disputed the administration's claims that Iraq had sought the uranium to build nuclear weapons, writing a July 6, 2003, op ed article in the New York Times titled "What I Didn't Find in Africa."
The piece was widely seen as an embarrassment for the administration.
Eight days after it was published, syndicated columnist Robert Novak reported that two administration officials had told him Wilson had been sent to Niger at the suggestion of his wife and identified Plame as a CIA agent.
Libby, in his discussions with FBI agents and the grand jury, maintained that he heard about Plame's covert status in discussions with journalists.
But the indictment alleges that Libby actively sought information from government officials about Wilson's trip to Africa and played a key role in spreading the word that Wilson's wife was a secret CIA operative.
When the investigation of the leak began in the fall of 2003, Libby told FBI agents that it was veteran NBC newsman Tim Russert who told him, "Hey, do you know that all reporters know that Mr Wilson's wife works at the CIA?" according to Fitzgerald.
Libby then told the FBI that he passed this information to Judith Miller of the New York Times and Matthew Cooper of Time magazine.
In testimony before the grand jury, Libby noted that he learned of Plame's identity from Cheney in June 2003, but he said he had forgotten it.
Libby said it was Russert's phone call that led him to pass on the information to Miller and Cooper.
"It would be a compelling story that would lead the FBI to go away, if only it were true," Fitzgerald said.
"It's not true."
In fact, the indictment documents seven occasions on which Libby allegedly discussed Plame's identity prior to his conversation with Russert.
Libby had discussed her role as a CIA agent with at least four people in the government, including Cheney, and on at least three occasions he shared the news of Plame's identity with other government officials, the indictment says.
The indictment alleges that Libby's conversation with Russert was not about Plame's identity.
Fitzgerald said Libby was the first person to tell any reporter about the case when the vice president's top aide revealed it to Miller on June 23, 2003.
"At the end of the day, what appears is that Mr Libby's story that he was at the tail end of a chain of phone calls, passing on from one reporter what he heard from another, was not true," Fitzgerald said.
"He was at the beginning of the chain of phone calls, the first official to disclose this information outside the government to a reporter.
And then he lied about it afterward, under oath and repeatedly."
Libby's lawyer, Joseph Tate, previewing what may be his defense strategy, said it appeared that Libby's poor memory may have contributed to the charges against him.
"As lawyers, we recognize that a person's recollection and memory of events will not always match those of other people, particularly when they are asked to testify months after the events occurred," Tate said.
"This is especially true in the hectic rush of issues and events at a busy time for our government."
Legal analysts speculated that Libby may agree to a plea deal to reduce his sentence and to spare the administration a long and embarrassing trial.
But Tate said he planned a vigorous defense of his client.
A lawyer for Wilson read a statement at the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., on Friday, saying the indictment marked a "sad day for America."
"Whatever the final outcome of the investigation and the prosecution, I continue to believe that revealing my wife Valerie's secret CIA identity was very wrong and harmful to our nation," the statement read.
"I feel that my family was attacked for my speaking the truth about the events that led our country to war."
Top White House aides Karl Rove and I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby exchanged information about their contacts with reporters regarding Valerie Plame in the days just before the CIA officer's cover was blown.
Rove told grand jurors it was even possible he first learned inside the White House from Libby that Bush administration critic Joe Wilson's wife worked for the CIA, according to people directly familiar with the testimony of President George W. Bush's closest political adviser.
The disclosure is the first known intersection between two central figures in the criminal investigation into the leak of Plame's identity.
Rove testified that his discussions with Libby before Plame's identity was made public were limited to information reporters had passed them, the people said.
Some evidence prosecutors have gathered conflicts with Libby's account of dealings with reporters.
Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald must determine whether the contacts were part of a concerted effort to illegally divulge Plame's CIA identity and undercut her husband's public criticism of the Iraq war or simply the trading of news and rumors that typically occurs inside the White House.
The prosecutor also is examining whether any witnesses gave false testimony or withheld information from the investigation.
His spokesman, Randall Samborn, declined comment Wednesday.
The Rove Libby contacts were confirmed to The Associated Press by people directly familiar with testimony the two witnesses gave or were shown before the grand jury.
All spoke solely on condition of anonymity because of the secrecy of the proceedings.
Libby's lawyer, Joseph Tate, did not return repeated phone calls this week seeking comment.
Rove and Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, have emerged as central figures in Fitzgerald's investigation because both had contacts with reporters who ultimately disclosed Plame's work for the CIA.
Federal law prohibits government officials from knowingly disclosing the identity of intelligence operatives.
Those familiar with the testimony and evidence said that during one of his grand jury appearances, Rove was shown testimony from Libby suggesting the two had discussed with each other information they had gotten about Wilson's wife from reporters in early July 2003.
Rove responded that Libby's testimony was consistent with his general recollection that he first had learned that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA from reporters or government officials who had talked with reporters.
Rove testified that he never intended any of his comments to reporters about Wilson's wife to serve as confirmation of Plame's identity.
On July 9, 2003, columnist Robert Novak told Rove he was writing a column that would report that Plame worked for the CIA, and Rove told the columnist he had heard similar information, according to his testimony.
Novak published a column the next week that said Plame worked for the CIA and had suggested that her agency send Wilson, a former ambassador, on a mission that raised questions about prewar intelligence the Bush administration used to justify invading Iraq.
Rove testified he told Libby about his contact with Novak about two days after it occurred.
In testimony shown to Rove, Libby stated Rove had told him about his contact with Novak and said he had told Rove about information he had gotten about Wilson's wife from NBC television journalist Tim Russert, according to a person directly familiar with the information shown to Rove.
Prosecutors, however, have a different account from Russert.
The network has said Russert told authorities he did not know about Wilson's wife's identity until it was published and therefore could not have told Libby about it.
Prosecutors also have evidence that Libby initiated the call with Russert and had initiated similar contact with another reporter, Judith Miller of The New York Times, several weeks earlier.
Rove was pressed by prosecutors on several matters, including why he failed to mention during the first of his four grand jury appearances that he also has discussed the Plame matter with a second reporter, Matt Cooper of Time magazine.
Rove testified during the first appearance about his contacts with Novak in the days before the columnist wrote about Plame.
When asked generally if he had conversations with other reporters in that session, he answered no.
Rove and his lawyer subsequently discovered an e mail Rove had sent top national security aide Stephen Hadley referencing a brief phone interview he had with Cooper.
The e mail jogged Rove's memory and during a subsequent grand jury appearance, he volunteered his recollections about his conversation with Cooper, and his lawyer provided the e mail to prosecutors.
Cooper also wrote a story about Plame.
Top White House aide I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby was indicted Friday on five counts of obstruction of justice, making false statements and perjury.
If convicted, Libby, who resigned immediately from his job as chief of staff to Vice President Dick Chency, faces up to 30 years in prison and a 1.24 million dollar fine.
The charges: One count of obstruction of justice.
The indictment alleges Libby, in his role as a senior government official, had access to classified information and came to learn the identity of a covert CIA agent whose husband was a critic of the Iraq war.
The indictment alleges Libby then proceeded to "mislead and deceive the grand jury as to when, and the manner and means by which (he) acquired and subsequently disclosed to the media information concerning the employment of Valerie Plame by the CIA.
Plame is the wife of Joseph Wilson, a former ambassador who attacked the intelligence used by the administration to justify the Iraq invasion in March 2003.
If convicted on that count Libby faces up to 10 years in prison and a 250000 dollar fine.
Two counts of making false statements.
The indictment alleges that Libby lied to FBI agents who interviewed him on October 14 and November 26, 2003 about conversations he had with a reporter from NBC News and another from Time magazine concerning Plame's employment at the CIA.
Each count carries a maximum five years in prison and a 250000 dollar fine.
Two counts of perjury.
The indictment alleges that Libby committed perjury while testifying under oath before the grand jury on March 5 and March 24, 2004.
It alleges that Libby told jurors that he had learned from the media that Plame worked for the CIA when in fact he had learned about it from Vice President Cheney and officials at the State Department.
Each count carries a maximum five years in prison and a 250000 dollar fine.
CHENEY AIDE INDICTED, LIBBY RESIGNS OVER PERJURY CHARGES IN CIA LEAK CASE, ROVE PROBE GOES ON FACES CHARGES OF PERJURY, OBSTRUCTION IN CIA LEAK INVESTIGATION FACES CHARGES OF PERJURY, MAKING FALSE STATEMENTS, OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE WASHINGTON I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, was indicted Friday on charges of perjury, making false statements, and obstruction of justice in the investigation into the leaked name of a CIA operative.
In a potentially damaging sign for the Bush administration, special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald said that although his investigation is nearly complete, "It's not over."
Libby, 55, one of the administration's most influential advisers in the decision to invade Iraq, resigned immediately upon being informed of his indictment.
Fitzgerald, after refusing for months to speak to the press, forcefully defended his decision to indict Libby.
"When a vice president's chief of staff is charged with perjury and obstruction of justice, it does show the world that this is a country that takes its law seriously, that all citizens are bound by the law," Fitzgerald said at a press conference.
Karl Rove, President Bush's deputy chief of staff and close political adviser, was not indicted but still faced the possibility of prosecution.
Fitzgerald said that his investigation was still ongoing.
Asked if Rove was "off the hook," Fitzgerald responded: "I'm not going to comment on any one name."
The Libby indictment is the latest in a series of problems for President Bush, who has suffered from low approval ratings and who on Thursday withdrew the troubled Supreme Court nomination of his counsel, Harriet Miers.
In a terse comment to reporters Friday, Bush said he accepted Libby's resignation and called the charges "serious."
But he cautioned that Libby must be "presumed innocent and entitled to due process."
Libby said in a statement that it was a "sad day" but he was "confident that at the end of this process I will be completely and totally exonerated."
If convicted on all five charges, Libby could receive a maximum of 30 years in prison and a $1.25 million fine.
Cheney issued a statement saying he accepted Libby's resignation "with deep regret."
"Scooter Libby is one of the most capable and talented individuals I have ever known," Cheney said.
Cheney, and perhaps Bush, might be called to testify at Libby's trial, in a case that could examine the way White House officials sought to rebut criticism of the decision to go to war.
The 22 page indictment of Libby lays out how Cheney's closest adviser allegedly lied to the grand jury about his discussions with reporters about the identity of Valerie Plame Wilson.
Libby told the grand jury that he learned of her employment at the CIA from reporters.
But the indictment said he learned about Plame's job from Cheney, an unnamed senior CIA official, an unnamed CIA briefer, an unnamed "senior White House official," and an unnamed undersecretary of state.
One of the key questions left unanswered by the indictment is whether Cheney played any role in leaking Plame's identity.
At the press conference, Fitzgerald declined to respond to any questions about Cheney's role, saying, "I'm not making allegations about anyone not charged in the indictment."
Like past Washington scandals, the indictment gave new life to the adage that "it's not the crime, it's the cover up."
Fitzgerald's investigation initially focused on whether there was a violation of a 1982 law that prohibits government officials from knowingly releasing the name of a covert agent.
But Fitzgerald did not bring charges on that statute, which is considered difficult to prosecute because of the need to prove intent.
Instead, Fitzgerald brought five charges: that Libby twice lied to FBI agents about his role in discussing Plame with reporters, twice committed perjury in speaking about his actions to the grand jury, and obstructed justice by trying to impede the grand jury's investigation through his pattern of lies and obfuscations.
Valerie Plame Wilson is the wife of Joseph Wilson, a former US ambassador with experience in Africa.
In 2002, Cheney's office asked the CIA to investigate claims that Iraq was trying to acquire material for nuclear weapons from Niger.
The CIA sent Joseph Wilson, who reported back to the CIA that he doubted the claim that Iraq was seeking a material known as yellowcake from Niger.
Nonetheless, Bush said in his January 2003 State of the Union speech that British intelligence had found that Iraq was seeking materials from Africa.
Starting in May 2003, Joseph Wilson became the anonymous source of stories about his doubts that Iraq had sought nuclear materials from Niger and the White House quickly determined that he was the source.
That, in turn, led Libby to ask government officials about Joseph Wilson and to determine whether his wife, who worked at the CIA, suggested that the agency send him to investigate Cheney's questions about Niger.
The indictment says that Libby learned about Valerie Plame Wilson's identity from Cheney in June 2003, contradicting Libby's assertion to the grand jury that he learned about her from reporters.
"Libby learned from the Vice President that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA in the Counterproliferation division," the indictment says.
On or around June 11, 2003, Libby was told by an unidentified CIA official "that Wilson's wife was employed by the CIA and that the idea of sending him to Niger originated with her," according to the indictment.
The following day, Libby was told by an unnamed undersecretary of state that Plame worked for the CIA.
Two days later, Libby discussed both Wilsons with his CIA briefer, the indictment says.
The White House's interest in Valerie Plame Wilson intensified when her husband went public with his doubts in a New York Times op ed piece in July in which he said that the Bush administration twisted evidence about Iraq's effort to acquire weapons of mass destruction.
The indictment laid out the chronology of Libby's knowledge about Valerie Plame Wilson in an effort to show that he lied about that knowledge when he spoke to the FBI and the grand jury.
For example, the indictment says that Libby testified before that grand jury that he learned around July 10, 2003 about Valerie Plame Wilson from Tim Russert, the moderator of NBC TV's "Meet The Press."
Libby testified that Russert asked if he knew that Valerie Plame Wilson worked for the CIA.
Libby testified that he was surprised to hear that she worked for the CIA, according to the indictment.
The indictment says this was a false statement because "Libby was well aware that Wilson's wife worked at the CIA and Libby had participated in multiple prior conversations concerning this topic."
Similarly, Libby testified that he told Matthew Cooper of Time magazine on or about July 12, 2003 that he had heard that reporters were saying Wilson's wife worked for the CIA.
The indictment said this was a false statement and that Libby instead "confirmed to Cooper, without qualification, that Libby had heard that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA."
And, the indictment says, Libby testified that he told Judith Miller of The New York Times on or about July 12, 2003 that he had heard that reporters were saying Valerie Plame Wilson worked for the CIA but that he did not know if it was true.
The indictment said this, too, was a false statement because Libby did not provide such a statement to Miller.
Miller, who spent 85 days in jail before acknowledging that Libby was her source, and who never wrote about the Wilsons, has said that she discussed Valerie Plame Wilson with Libby but could not say who first told her about Wilson.
Joseph Wilson, addressing the administration's motive in leaking his wife's CIA job, said in a statement released Friday, "I feel that my family was a acked for my speaking the truth about the events that led our country to war."
The indictment provides some clues about unanswered questions in the case.
The indictment says that Libby told then White House press secretary Ari Fleischer around July 7, 2003 that Valerie Plame Wilson worked at the CIA "and noted that such information was not widely known."
But the indictment does not say what Fleischer did with that information.
The indictment also says that Libby spoke to a senior White House aide identified only as "Official A" around July 10, 2003, and that this official had previously spoken about Valerie Plame Wilson with columnist Robert Novak.
It was Novak's July 14, 2003 column that revealed her identity and set the investigation in motion.
Novak has never revealed the names of his two sources for that column.
The Associated Press quoted sources as saying Rove was "Official A." Friday, Rove's lawyer, Robert Luskin, said in a statement that Rove was cooperating with the investigation, adding, "We are confident that when the special counsel finishes his work, he will conclude that Mr Rove has done nothing wrong."
The special counsel, Fitzgerald, said the term of the grand jury has expired, but he stressed that, "It's an ordinary course to keep a grand jury open to consider other matters, and that's what we will be doing."
He would not comment on whether further indictments would be brought.
"We're not quite done," Fitzgerald said.
"But I don't want to ,add to a feverish pitch.
You know, it's very, very routine that you keep a grand jury available for what you might need.
And that's all I can say because of the rules of grand jury secrecy."

At least seven Bush administration officials outside the CIA knew Valerie Plame was a CIA employee before the disclosure of her name in a newspaper column in July 2003, according to Friday's indictment of I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby.
In no case other than Libby's does the indictment contend that one of the government employees provided the name to reporters.
The indictment does not identify anyone other than Libby.
But some are easy to determine.
Of course, the "vice president of the United States" is Dick Cheney, for whom Libby worked as chief of staff.
Cheney told Libby that Plame worked at the CIA, information that Libby understood came from the agency, the indictment said.
The person referred to as "then White House press secretary" is Ari Fleischer.
Libby discussed Plame's employment at the CIA with Fleischer, noting "that such information was not widely known," the indictment said.
Names of two of the others were disclosed by a Justice Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the identities have not been publicly released.
Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman also told Libby that Plame worked at the CIA, apparently in response to a request from Libby for details about a former ambassador's trip to Niger to investigate claims that Iraq tried to buy uranium yellowcake in that African nation.
The ex diplomat was Joseph Wilson, Plame's husband.
The "assistant to the vice president for public affairs" is Catherine Martin.
She learned that Plame was a CIA employee from yet another government official and advised Libby.
The identity of the other government official remains a secret.
Another mystery is the person described in the indictment as "a senior official in the White House."
This person, identified as "Official A," also spoke about Plame's job and identity with columnist Robert Novak a few days before Novak's column appeared.
It's possible this person is White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove, who has acknowledged talking to reporters about Plame.
Rove was not indicted but remains under investigation.
Notes by the New York Times' Judith Miller that were turned over in a criminal investigation contain the name of a covert CIA officer, but the reporter has told prosecutors she cannot recall who disclosed the name, the newspaper reported Saturday.
The prosecutor in the case asked Miller in recent days to explain how Valerie Plame misspelled in those notes as "Valerie Flame" appeared in the same notebook the reporter used in interviewing her confidential source, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, according to the Times.
In response to questioning by Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, Miller replied that she "didn't think" she heard Plame's name from Cheney's aide, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby.
"I said I believed the information came from another source, whom I could not recall," Miller wrote, recounting her testimony for an article that the newspaper posted on its Web site Saturday afternoon.
"Valerie Flame" actually was the name in the notebook, and the Times said Miller should have written Valerie Plame.
I. Lewis Libby Jr., Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff, pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges that he lied about disclosing classified information.
Libby, 55, resigned as Cheney's top aide last week after he was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges that he lied about his role in the leaking of the name of an undercover CIA agent to journalists.
Libby entered the plea in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton, an appointee of President Bush.
The grand jury indicted Libby, after a nearly two year investigation, on charges of perjury, obstruction of justice and making false statements.
The five count indictment charges that Libby lied to FBI agents and to the grand jury about how and when he came to learn classified information about a CIA operative, Valerie Plame.
If convicted on each count, Libby faces up to 30 years in prison and a $1.25 million fine.
Libby has acknowledged speaking to reporters about Plame, but has denied that he revealed that she was an undercover operative, which could be a violation of federal law.
The grand jury did not indict Karl Rove, President Bush's top political strategist, who had also become entangled in the investigation.
However, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the special counsel in the case, said in announcing the indictment of Libby last week that the probe is "not over."
After his indictment last week, Libby issued a statement saying he expected to be "totally exonerated."
The five charges relate to Libby's testimony to the grand jury, and statements he made to authorities regarding discussions he had with Tim Russert of NBC News, Judith Miller of The New York Times, and Matthew Cooper of Time magazine.
Fitzgerald said during a news conference last week that Libby had at least seven conversations with various government officials about Plame before he claimed to have learned her identity from Russert.
The special counsel said Libby and Russert had, in fact, never discussed Plame.
"At the end of the day, what appears is that Libby's story that he was at the tail end of a chain of phone calls, passing on from one reporter what he heard from another, was not true," Fitzgerald said during the news conference.
"It was false.
He was at the beginning of the chain of phone calls, the first official to disclose this information outside the government to a reporter.
And then he lied about it afterwards, under oath, and repeatedly."
While the federal investigation had originally centered on who had leaked the name of Plame, no one has been charged with violating a 1982 federal law that prohibits revealing the identity of covert operatives.
Plame is married to Joseph C. Wilson IV, a former ambassador, who criticized the Bush administration's stated reasons for going to war in Iraq.
In 2002, Wilson traveled to Niger at the behest of the CIA to investigate whether the African nation had been discussing supplying uranium to Saddam Hussein so that Iraq could develop nuclear weapons.
Wilson, who said he found no evidence of such an effort, later challenged a statement made by President Bush about Iraqi attempts to obtain uranium yellowcake from Niger.
Wilson has said that Bush administration officials revealed the identity of his wife to the reporters as a way of retaliating against him.
DOUBTS ABOUT MIERSTHANKS TO her friends in the White House, Harriet Miers will face the Senate Judiciary Committee bearing a greater burden than John Roberts, now the chief justice of the Supreme Court.
Roberts, as a protg of his predecessor, William Rehnquist, had strong conservative and legal credentials, so his handlers from the Bush administration bristled when some liberal groups began to question what role his Roman Catholic upbringing and faith might play on the court.
Religion is not relevant to the appointment, they said.
But Miers has few credentials of any kind to carry into her confirmation hearings, expected to begin next month.
So Bush and his minions have tried to reassure skeptical conservatives by pointing to her religious beliefs.
Though raised a Catholic, Miers is now an evangelical Protestant whose commitment to her faith is portrayed by supporters as deep seated and steadfast.
"Part of Harriet Miers's life is her religion," Bush said on Wednesday.
Miers is smart enough to tell senators that her views and actions on the bench would be based on the Constitution and not religious scripture.
But there will doubtless be a focus on religion in her hearings, in large part because of Bush's effort to have it both ways.
Asked for Miers's judicial philosophy, the White House has given us the worldview of James Dobson, founder of the archconservative group Focus on the Family.
Dobson's support for Miers was solicited by Bush's aide Karl Rove even before Bush introduced her to the country, showing what constituency is most important to this administration.
So senators will likely put Miers on the spot to extricate herself credibly from a tangle of religious implications that now threatens to become more of a trap than a safety net.
Beyond that, senators will rightly press Miers for evidence of her ability to think independently and powerfully on constitutional issues.
Roberts was not well known before his nomination, but what experience he had was gold plated: clerking for Rehnquist, a reputation as one of the most effective advocates before the Supreme Court, and two years on the top federal appeals court.
And Roberts backed this up with an impressive grasp and articulation of constitutional issues.
Miers has no such experience.
Liberals worry, understandably, that she might be a lapdog for Justice Antonin Scalia, showing the same kind of loyalty to Bush's favorite judge as she has to Bush himself.
But it would not be much better if she were a lapdog for a more moderate or liberal judge.
In the long run, the Supreme Court needs strong, independent minds.
It will be up to Miers to show senators, and the nation, that she would not be beholden to Bush or Scalia or any other influence, including the Bible.
President George W. Bush on Monday nominated White House counsel Harriet Miers to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court, reaching into his loyal inner circle for a pick that could reshape the nation's judiciary for years to come.
"She has devoted her life to the rule of law and the cause of justice," Bush said, announcing his choice from the Oval Office with Miers at his side.
"She will be an outstanding addition to the Supreme Court of the United States."
If confirmed by the Republican controlled Senate, Miers, 60, would join Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the second woman on the nation's highest court and the third to serve there.
Miers, who has never been a judge, was the first woman to serve as president of the Texas State Bar and the Dallas Bar Association.
President Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers for the Supreme Court splintered the Republican Party's conservative base, with reaction from key senators and groups ranging from hostility to silence to praise.
Several right leaning lawmakers and activists seemed bewildered by the choice of a relatively little known White House counsel who has given money to Democratic candidates and who was recommended for the job by Minority Leader Harry Reid, D Nev.
While numerous senators urged colleagues to withhold judgment until more is known, some outsiders vented their dismay that the president had not chosen someone with unmistakably conservative credentials.
"I know of nothing in Harriet Miers' background that would qualify her for an appointment to the Supreme Court," said Roger Pilon, founder of the libertarian Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies.
William Kristol, editor of the influential conservative magazine Weekly Standard, summarized his reaction as "disappointed, depressed and demoralized."
In the Senate, which will confirm or reject Miers this fall, the nomination triggered a mixture of praise and reserve that, on balance, seemed to bode well for her confirmation, veteran staffers said.
The acclaim she received from GOP leaders was expected, they said.
Less predictable were the accolades from Reid, the Democratic leader, and several conservative Republicans on the Judiciary Committee.
"My conversations with Harriet Miers indicate that she is a first rate lawyer and a fine person," said Sen Jeff Sessions.
R Ala., one of the committee's most conservative members.
"Her legal skills are proven and her reputation throughout the legal community is excellent."
Sen Lindsey Graham (S.C.), another committee Republican, said Bush "has made a solid pick for the Supreme Court."
But two other committee conservatives withheld judgment.
Sen Tom Coburn, R Okla., issued a two sentence statement saying Miers "deserves a fair and thorough hearing and confirmation process.
I look forward to learning more about her qualifications and judicial philosophy."
Sen Sam Brownback, R Kan., made no public comments despite several media requests.
The praise from Reid, who voted against Chief Justice John Roberts's confirmation last month, turned heads in both parties.
"I have to say without any qualification that I'm very happy that we have someone like her," Reid told reporters as he greeted Miers in the Capitol.
Earlier in the day, Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter, R Pa., said Reid had "recommended her nomination to the president" in a White House meeting two weeks ago.
Reid spokesman Jim Manley said the Democratic leader had "urged the president to consider" Miers.
Miers's supporters tried to appease conservatives by releasing information suggesting she opposes abortion rights.
Publicist Keith Appell issued a statement saying, "According to Kyleen Wright at Texans for Life, Harriet Miers gave $150 to the organization then known as Texans United for Life in 1989.
Miers was a bronze patron for their annual dinner in which Henry Hyde was the keynote speaker."
Hyde, a U.S. House member from Illinois, is a leading opponent of legalized abortion.
Wright confirmed the contribution Monday, but said, "I'm not sure it says anything one way or the other."
Wright said most of the roughly two dozen bronze contributors were candidates, and Miers at the time was on the Dallas City Council.
Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, issued a statement expressing the ambivalence of several groups on the right.
"President Bush has long made it clear that his choices for the U.S. Supreme Court would be in the mold of current justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas," Perkins said.
"We have no reason to believe he has abandoned that standard.
However, our lack of knowledge about Harriet Miers, and the absence of a record on the bench, give us insufficient information from which to assess whether or not she is indeed in that mold."
Gary Bauer, 2000 presidential candidate and president of American Values, said "the future of the Supreme Court is too important to leave to chance."
In private, some conservative leaders voiced concern that Miers could become "another David Souter," the Supreme Court justice picked by President Bush's father who has turned out to be a reliable member of the court's liberal wing.
They pointed to her 1988 contributions to Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign, the re election campaign of Sen Lloyd Bentsen, D Texas, and the Democratic National Committee.
The 1988 Democratic Platform endorsed abortion rights.
Some groups on the right flatly opposed Miers's confirmation Monday.
"We must reject the nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court, said Troy Newman, president of the anti abortion rights group Operation Rescue.
"Miers is no Thomas or Scalia."
Two prominent conservatives, however, endorsed Miers, including American Center for Law and Justice Chief Counsel Jay Sekulow, who has become a close White House ally.
James Dobson of Focus on the Family said, "We welcome the president's nomination,(Bush) promised to select competent judges who will 'not use the bench to write social policy.'
,We believe that she will not prove to be a lone exception."
Almost unanimously, leaders on the left said senators must press Miers to make explicit her judicial philosophy and her stands on the right to privacy and civil rights.
"If she is confirmed, Harriet Miers may cast the deciding vote in cases that will determine whether women and minorities have equal opportunity in education and the workplace, whether we can be free and equal members of society, and whether we can make our personal and private family decisions without government intrusion," said Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families.
"Senators have a duty to ask probing questions and learn Miers's views before voting on her nomination."
In a statement, the liberal Alliance for Justice said: "Ms Miers must prove that she can put her years of service to President Bush and powerful corporate interests behind her and be an independent voice on the court.
The burden is on Harriet Miers to demonstrate her fitness for a seat on the Supreme Court to the Senate and the American people.
There is a tremendous amount at stake.
Our rights and liberties hang in the balance."
President Bush on Wednesday moved religion to the forefront of the debate over Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers, defending his administration's work behind the scenes to inform social conservatives about her Christian faith.
"People ask me why I picked Harriet Miers," Bush said.
"They want to know Harriet Miers' background.
They want to know as much as they possibly can before they form opinions.
And part of Harriet Miers' life is her religion."
Bush's remarks appeared to further inflame the controversy over the nomination.
Some conservatives and religious leaders complained that the president's rationale failed to address their core objections: that Miers is not qualified and her nomination looks like cronyism.
"Do not patronize us by assuming that we will immediately support Ms Miers as a Supreme Court justice because we hear she is an evangelical Christian," said the Rev. Patrick J. Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition, a religious pro life group.
The injection of religion also drew fire from critics who noted that the White House had scrupulously guarded the nomination process of Chief Justice John Roberts from questions about his Roman Catholic faith.
Bush was defending attempts in recent days by Vice President Dick Cheney, political adviser Karl Rove and White House insiders, such as former Republican Party Chairman Ed Gillespie, to reassure social and religious conservatives about Miers' faith and conservatism.
Those moves seemed to create a new class of critic among some legal scholars, who questioned whether religious leaders such as Focus on the Family's James Dobson, who had been personally contacted by Rove ahead of Miers' nomination, should have a voice in the process.
"The president and his aides can consult whomever they wish.
But the process of choosing a Supreme Court justice should be based on merit and, of course, understanding of and loyalty to the Constitution," said Erwin Chemerinsky, professor of law at Duke University.
"The blessing of the religious right should not determine a person's suitability to serve on the Supreme Court."
In defense of Miers, Bush has employed several strategies to build support.
But despite those efforts, a drumbeat in favor of withdrawing her nomination continued gathering strength among conservative activists and opinion leaders.
"Most conservatives, I think, want Bush to succeed and would be eager to mend fences with a new nominee," said Jonah Goldberg, a conservative columnist at the National Review.
A critic of the Miers nomination, Goldberg called Bush's statements about her faith "unfortunate."
"I have no problem with him picking an evangelical Christian or putting stock in a nominee's faith as an insurance policy against 'drift' toward the liberal cosmopolitanism we've seen from some on the court," Goldberg said.
"But such insurance policies aren't reliable."
A new poll from the Pew Research Center highlighted the issue of cronyism, with 41 percent saying they believe Bush "offers important jobs to his friends and political allies"more than earlier presidents.
Nine percent said Bush did it less, while 44 percent said other presidents gave their friends top jobs as much as Bush does.
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, appearing on Fox News Channel to defend the Miers nomination, dismissed charges of cronyism and predicted that she will be confirmed.
"I don't think you should be disqualified from being considered for an important position simply because you have a relationship with the person making the decision on who to nominate," he said.
"You have to look first at a person's qualifications."
Adding to the White House woes over Miers, first lady Laura Bush, a popular figure frequently deployed by the administration to generate public support and good will, sparked her own mini furor when she speculated that sexism may be fueling some of the opposition to Miers.
For the most part, Democrats and liberal advocacy groups have stayed out of the fray, biding their time while Bush gets knocked off message by members of his own party.
The Miers nomination presents a tricky choice for Democrats, who could either try to defeat her and risk Bush choosing a more conservative nominee, or support her and sacrifice the chance to use her nomination and related issues such as cronyism against Republicans in the 2006 midterm elections.
Signaling the party's intent to fight, Ralph Neas, president of the liberal People for the American Way, expressed outrage about what he called the administration's double standard in bringing religion into the Miers' debate after refusing to allow Roberts' Catholicism to become an issue in his confirmation.
"It's hypocrisy, doubled and quadrupled," Neas said.
"Whether they're shouting it from the rooftops or whispering into the ears of their right wing supporters, Miers' personal religious beliefs should have no place in her nomination."
President George W. Bush said Wednesday that Harriet Miers' religious beliefs figured into her nomination to the Supreme Court as a top ranking Democrat warned against any "wink and a nod" campaign for confirmation.
"People are interested to know why I picked Harriet Miers," Bush told reporters at the White House.
"They want to know Harriet Miers' background.
They want to know as much as they possibly can before they form opinions.
And part of Harriet Miers' life is her religion."
Bush, speaking at the conclusion of an Oval Office meeting with visiting Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski, said that his advisers were reaching out to conservatives who oppose her nomination "just to explain the facts."
He spoke on a day in which conservative James Dobson, founder of Focus on Family, said he had discussed the nominee's religious views with presidential aide Karl Rove.
Not even a congressional recess nor Bush's preoccupation with hurricane recovery and affairs of state shrouded the continuing controversy surrounding his selection of Miers to replace the retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
Debate about Miers' credentials was prominent on the Sunday television talk shows and has continued to occupy considerable attention on the Internet.
Some of Bush's conservative critics say Miers has no judicial record that proves she will strictly interpret the Constitution and not as Bush says "legislate from the bench."
They argue that Bush passed up other more qualified candidates to nominate someone from his inner circle.
On a radio show being broadcast Wednesday, Dobson said he discussed Miers with Rove on Oct 1, two days before her nomination was announced.
Dobson said Rove told him "she is from a very conservative church, which is almost universally pro life," but denied he had gotten any assurances from the White House that she would vote to overturn the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.
Sen Patrick Leahy, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said: "The rest of America, including the Senate, deserves to know what he and the White House know."
"We don't confirm Justices of the Supreme Court on a wink and a nod.
And a litmus test is no less a litmus test by using whispers and signals," the Vermont senator said.
"No political faction should be given a monopoly of relevant knowledge about a nomination, just as no faction should be permitted to hound a nominee to withdraw, before the hearing process has even begun."
Conservative outrage over President George W. Bush's controversial pick of Texas lawyer Harriet Miers to fill a vacancy on the US Supreme Court was unabated Sunday as activists called on the White House to withdraw her nomination.
Among the most outspoken detractors was former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, who, on NBC television's "Meet the Press" program, said Bush should name someone else to fill the vacancy on the US high court.
"I would like to see the nomination withdrawn.
If I were in the Senate today I would vote against it," Buchanan said.
"My guess is, she will not be confirmed, and she will be withdrawn."
The Weekly Standard, a bible for dyed in the wool conservatives, on Sunday called the choice of Miers "at best an error, at worst a disaster" which should be reconsidered.
"He has put up an unknown and undistinguished figure for an opening that conservatives worked for a generation to see filled with a jurist of high distinction," the magazine's editor Bill Kristol wrote.
"The best alternative would be for Miers to withdraw," the conservative pundit said.
"Her nomination has hurt the president whom she came to Washington to serve."
Conservatives have been harshly critical of Bush's choice of Miers, fearing the president may have blown the best chance in decades for Republicans to move the high court the arbiter of legal disputes on a wide range of hot button social issues definitively to the right.
If confirmed, Miers would fill the seat of retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court and often a critical swing vote on the nine member panel.
Miers, 60, currently is White House counsel, and served as Bush's personal attorney when he was governor of Texas.
Her opinions on abortion and other burning issues are largely unknown and staunch conservatives have said they would have preferred a candidate whose views were clear.
Bush's rightwing supporters are further miffed that in choosing Miers, an old friend and longtime aide, the president passed over several better known, better qualified conservative candidates.
The distrust among conservatives is even greater because of a decision in 1990 by Bush's father, president George H.W. Bush, to nominate David Souter to the US high court.
Souter originally was thought to be a bedrock conservative, but in many key Supreme Court votes, he has sided with liberals.
Gleeful Democrats who have been enjoying the spectacle of Republicans battling amongst themselves have expressed relief that Bush appears to have avoided a major battle by nominating someone without an avowedly extremist agenda.
Meanwhile, moderate Republicans have stuck by the president, at least outwardly, and decried the rush to dismiss Meirs.
"What you've had here on Harriet Miers is not a rush to judgment.
It's a stampede to judgment.
She's faced tough one of the toughest lynch mobs ever assembled in Washington," said Arlen Specter, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, speaking on ABC television.
"She's intelligent, she's hard working, unquestioned integrity.
She fought her way up, couldn't get a job when she graduated from law school because she was a woman," Specter said in Miers's defense.
But he indicated there was some cause to worry about the qualifications of Miers, who has never served as a judge.
"When you deal in constitutional law, you're dealing in some very esoteric complicated subjects that require a great deal of background," Specter said.
"And that kind of background doesn't come unless you are in the field or unless you're really studying it."
Bush on Saturday sought to reassure conservatives, saying in his weekly radio address that Miers was a solid conservative who would not drift to the left if seated on the high court.
"I chose Harriet Miers for the court both because of her accomplishments, and because I know her character and her judicial philosophy.
Harriet Miers will be the type of judge I said I would nominate a good conservative judge," Bush said.
The chaos surrounding President Bush's Supreme Court nomination of Harriet Miers gets curiouser and curiouser.
Sen Patrick Leahy, D Vt., ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, spoke for many Wednesday when he said, "We'd actually like to know what the heck is going on."
Thank goodness Leahy and committee Chairman Arlen Specter, R Pa., are working in a bipartisan way to protect the integrity of the Senate confirmation process and, ultimately, the integrity of the Supreme Court.
This nomination was in difficulty from the very start and for the right reason: questions about Miers' qualifications.
This is, after all, a lifetime appointment to the country's highest court.
Initially, the challenge to Miers came from conservatives, who wanted a nominee steeped in constitutional law and a firm believer in hewing closely to the language in the Constitution.
Miers has never been a judge, and by all accounts has little experience in constitutional law.
Bush sought to reassure at least the religious right by talking about Miers' strong evangelical religious beliefs, implying that she could be trusted to vote their way on culture war issues, including overturning Roe vs. Wade, the 1983 abortion ruling.
Indeed, recent news reports suggest the White House encouraged two judges in Texas who know Miers to hold a conference call with evangelical leaders in which the judges said flat out that Miers would vote to overturn Roe. That rightly raised both Republican and Democratic eyebrows.
But things just kept getting worse.
First, Specter, who is a very careful man, said Miers had endorsed the privacy concept in Griswold vs. Connecticut, a landmark decision on which the reasoning in Roe is based.
But Miers denied she'd told Specter that, leaving him dumbfounded and more than a little miffed.
Finally came Miers' responses to a questionnaire sent her by the Judiciary Committee.
According to Leahy, members of the committee on both sides of the aisle found the responses "inadequate," "insufficient" and "insulting."
Leahy and Specter asked her to do it over, with greater emphasis on precision.
As the New York Times remarked, this amounted to "a do over on a take home quiz."
Maybe it's Bush who needs a do over.
Leahy, Specter and their colleagues in both parties now seem loaded for bear as Miers' confirmation hearings approach, and that's a good thing.
If she comes out of those hearings looking as unqualified as she looks going in, the committee should reject her and ask Bush to send up another name.
President Bush Friday rejected conservative calls to withdraw his nomination of White House counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court and prepared to reassure skeptical Republicans and persuade the Senate to confirm her for the seat of retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
Bush advisers who once anticipated all out war with Democrats over his attempts to reshape the Supreme Court have had to recalibrate their strategy to battle an insurrection among Republicans who contend the president was obligated to nominate a top flight legal figure with an unmistakably conservative pedigree.
At every point where the White House has hoped it might have turned the corner, it has run into more flak from the right.
Just Friday, columnist Charles Krauthammer and Weekly Standard editor William Kristol called on Bush to withdraw the Miers nomination, with Krauthammer deriding her selection as "scandalous" and "a joke."
Another icon of the conservative movement, former Judge Robert H. Bork, denounced it as "a disaster on every level."
The president made it clear Friday that he has no intention of backing down.
Asked about the calls to withdraw the nomination, he said, "No, she is going to be on the bench, she'll be confirmed.
And when she's on the bench, people will see a fantastic woman who is honest, open, humble and capable of being a great Supreme Court judge."
PICKUP 5thgraf: White House spokesman Scott xxx.
US President George W. Bush has picked White House legal counsel Harriet Miers to be a new US Supreme Court justice, an administration official told AFP early Monday.
Miers, who was previously Bush's deputy chief of staff, has been picked to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her retirement in early July.
A formal announcement was expected at 1200 GMT Monday.
Miers will have to be confirmed by the US Senate.
Bush has been consulting with his aides and lawmakers on the issue over the past weeks, and White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Thursday the president "has been considering a diverse group of potential nominees."
Earlier plans called for replacing O'Connor with federal judge John Roberts.
But he was re nominated to be US chief justice after the death of William Rehnquist in early September.
Roberts, who was sworn in as US chief justice last week, has his first day on the US high court on Monday.
WASHINGTON President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet Miers on Monday for the U.S. Supreme Court, putting the spotlight on a woman who has made a career out of avoiding it.
"She has devoted her life to the rule of law and the cause of justice," Bush said.
"She will be an outstanding addition to the Supreme Court of the United States."
If confirmed, Miers, a former Dallas lawyer, would replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her retirement plans earlier this year.
Miers, formerly Bush's personal lawyer, is now the White House counsel.
She came to Washington with Bush in 2001 as staff secretary and became deputy chief of staff before becoming the top White House lawyer when Alberto Gonzales became attorney general.
The announcement which drew kind words from some Democrats and skepticism from some conservatives came just before Bush went to the Supreme Court to watch Chief Justice John Roberts, who won Senate confirmation last week, take the gavel.
The Miers nomination also drew charges by critics that Bush, again, was turning to his insular world and tapping someone not suited to the task.
Moveon.org, which rallied against Bush in the last election, called Miers another Bush "crony" riding his coattails.
"Michael Brown taught us that vital national positions must be filled with qualified candidates, not political friends with little experience," Eli Pariser, the group's executive director, said, referring to the former director of Federal Emergency Management Agency, a political appointee forced out in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
"There is "no information to indicate (Miers) meets the high bar necessary for the next justice on the Supreme Court."
But Bush said that Miers' lack of judicial experience is a positive.
He noted that late Chief Justice William Rehnquist was one of more than 30 justices whose first judicial service came on the high court.
"I'm proud to nominate an outstanding woman who brings a similar record of achievement in private practice and public service," Bush said.
Some Democrats agreed.
New York Sen Charles Schumer said that "somebody whose experience is practical and real world is good" for the court.
As White House counsel, Miers played a lead role in Bush's judicial selections, including his pick of Roberts.
In recent weeks, she moved from head of the search committee to candidate in a process that ended when Bush offered her the job at a White House dinner Sunday night.
The process harkened back to when Dick Cheney, head of Bush's search for a running mate in 2000, wound up as the running mate.
"I am very grateful for the confidence in me that you have shown by this nomination," Miers told Bush Monday, "and, certainly, I am humbled by it."
O'Connor, the court's first female, has often been the moderate swing vote on a sharply divided court.
Her replacement also could become a pivotal vote.
Bush praised Miers' frequent "first woman" accomplishments and pronounced her his kind of justice.
"Harriet Miers will strictly interpret our Constitution and laws," Bush said in the Oval Office.
"She will not legislate from the bench."
He also recalled he had appointed Miers to head the Texas Lottery Commission during a series of scandals in the 1990s, an era that included a lawsuit by a former lottery director who said officials protected a lottery contractor with information about how Bush got into the National Guard.
"When I came to office as the governor of Texas, the Lottery Commission needed a leader of unquestioned integrity," Bush said. "
I chose Harriet because I knew she would earn the confidence of the people of Texas."
In accepting the nomination, Miers professed "great respect and admiration for the genius that inspired our Constitution and our system of government."
"The wisdom of those who drafted our constitution and conceived our nation as functioning with three strong and independent branches have proven truly remarkable," Miers said.
"It is the responsibility of every generation to be true to the founders' vision of the proper role of the courts in our society."
The 60 year old Miers has served Bush in a variety of private, political and government roles.
Most have been done in a way that does not shed much light on her judicial or political philosophy.
It's a career in the shadows background that has both ends of the political spectrum looking for answers as the process moved toward confirmation hearings the White House would like completed by Thanksgiving.
Curiously, many of the nicer initial words came from Democrats.
"I like Harriet Miers," said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D Nev., who had recommended her to Bush.
"My first reaction is a simple one: It could have been a lot worse," said Schumer.
"The president has not sent us a nominee who has already hewed to the extreme wing of his party," Schumer said, crediting Bush for realizing "that the views of the extreme right wing of his party aren't the views of the American people, or even close to it."
But in Miers, as with Roberts, Bush "sent us a nominee who we really don't know that much about."
After meeting with Miers for over an hour, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter, R Penn., said, "Everything I know about Ms Miers is good, but I do not know a great deal about her professional activities or her academic standing or her work in her legal career, which appears to be a very distinguished career."
From the right, the doubts came from the movement's leading radio voice.
During an interview with Vice President Cheney, Rush Limbaugh noted that President Clinton "chose liberals that were liberals without question, card carrying ACLU members."
Limbaugh said the Miers nomination "has some people scratching their heads because we've seemed to pick a nominee here that is oriented in some way to placating Democrats."
Conservative columnist Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, said the choice demoralized conservatives.
"It looks like he capitulated," Kristol said of Bush.
Cheney, on Limbaugh's show, defended the choice and said Bush, in appointing Roberts and Miers, has "done more to change the court ? than any of his predecessors in modern times."
The vice president disagreed "with the notion that something this is an effort to appease the left."
Despite the assurances from the White House, several conservative groups came out swinging against Miers.
Troy Newman, president of Operation Rescue, an anti abortion rights group, noted that "some" have put Miers in the same category with "pro abortion administration officials Condoleezza Rice and Karen Hughes."
"We must be given a nominee that will restore the protections of personhood to the pre born.
If your head was about to be crushed, would you want to trust you life to someone who will not state their position on your murder?
Newman said.
Miers' position on abortion is unknown.
The closest she has come to public involvement in that controversy came in 1993 when she played a leading role in challenging the American Bar Association's support for abortion rights.
Miers, without voicing a position on abortion, called for a referendum on the issue.
Specter, an abortion rights advocate, said that episode offered no insight on Miers' position.
"I believe more precisely she took the position that the American Bar Association should not take a position on Roe," Specter said.
"I'm sure that will be the subject of inquiry, and I would expect to go into that right at the start, to put on the record exactly what those facts are."
Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, which opposes abortion rights, expressed doubts about Miers.
Perkins recalled that Bush has said his nominees "would be in the mold of current Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas."
"We have no reason to believe he has abandoned that standard," Perkins said.
"However, our lack of knowledge about Harriet Miers, and the absence of a record on the bench, give us insufficient information from which to assess whether or not she is indeed in that mold.
In the days to come, Harriet Miers will have the chance to demonstrate such a philosophy."
(Optional add begins) Years ago, Miers said it's a question Supreme Court nominees should not even be asked.
In February 1992, serving on an ABA convention panel in Dallas, Miers was asked whether a president looking for a Supreme Court nominee should ask how potential nominees about how he or she would vote in abortion cases.
"Nominees are clearly prohibited from making such a commitment and presidents are prohibited from asking for it," said Miers, then the president election of the State Bar of Texas.
Miers added that anybody who believes that line of inquiry is proper displays "a misunderstanding of the separation of powers by proposing that judicial nominees should mirror a president's views."
(Optional add ends) Despite the initial kind words about Miers from Democrats, both sides are anticipating a battle over the release of White House documents that could shed light on her philosophy.
"Given how little we know about this nominee other than her work as the President's lawyer, the White House needs to disclose all documents requested by the Judiciary Committee, and Ms Miers needs to explain her thoughts on constitutional interpretation," said Sen John Kerry, D Mass. Specter indicated little of that material would be released, noting that much of Miers' White House work since coming to Washington with Bush is covered by executive privilege and attorney client privilege.
Sen Lindsey Graham, R S.C., said, "I expect the liberal left to make demands upon the administration to produce information protected by attorney client privilege.
Efforts such as these to derail a qualified nominee like Miers should fail."
The White House took no official position on the release of documents.
"Let's let those requests come in and then we will be glad to talk about it," McClellan said.
Like some of the groups on the right, left leaning groups said they need to know much more about Miers.
"With no past judicial experience for the senators to consider, the burden will be on Miers to be forthright with the Senate and the American people," Neas said.
"She must outline her judicial philosophy and provide direct answers to questions about how and whether she will uphold fundamental rights, liberties and legal protections on which Americans rely."

Bad timing.
In other circumstances, President George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers for the U.S. Supreme Court might have gone through without a blip.
The first woman president of the Dallas and Texas bar associations, she was seen as heading toward the presidency of the American Bar Association, before she went to the White House.
The first woman hired by a prestigious Dallas law firm, she rose to become its first woman president.
She was listed by the National Law Journal as one of the 50 most influential woman lawyers in the country.
The credentials seemed to be there, and she was a friend of the president.
But in these hyper ideological times with the court's direction hanging in the balance and with cronyism charges swirling around Mr Bush, things didn't go right.
Some complained about Ms Miers' qualifications: She hadn't been a judge or written law review articles.
This seemed to be the respectable way for rigid conservatives to highlight the fact that she wasn't on record as favoring their agenda.
When that attack started, she had few defenders, because people across the political spectrum wanted to know more about her views before getting on board.
And she didn't help herself.
She filled out a background form for the Senate in a way that insulted leaders of both parties.
Her private meetings with senators were reported to be superficial.
She and Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter, a crucial player, disagreed about what she told him in their meeting.
Finally, on Wednesday, an old speech came to light in which she suggested that the courts should not get into private lives, but should honor "self determination."
That was a big problem with anti abortion people.
They pushed President Bush to give up.
He did.
The White House pretended that Ms Miers' stepping aside stems from a fight about whether the White House should have to turn over papers that it doesn't want to release.
But that's a transparent cover.
When the nomination was first announced the president's selection of a person without a record on hot button topics seemed a smart way to avoid a knockdown battle.
But he didn't count on the ideological fixation of some of his supporters.
Now things are worse.
Now that conservatives have essentially exercised a veto, Democrats must feel more free to do the same, which could mean a filibuster.
With conservatives having trashed a nominee on the grounds of qualifications and having achieved the withdrawal they wanted even before hearings, they can hardly make the case that every nominee deserves an up or down vote, and they can hardly complain about personal attacks.
What kind of philosophy a Justice Harriet Miers would have followed is not clear.
She seems to have changed her mind over the years on some big issues.
But the case that she would not be a rigid ideologue was looking stronger as time went by.
That would have been good for the country.
Maybe, however, she wasn't the right person for the extraordinary test she faced.
This, after all, is the fight that the left and right have been girding for.
Few people could handle the pressure perfectly.
Next.
This editorial appeared in the Dayton Daily News.
Embattled President George W. Bush, acknowledging a serious political defeat, announced Thursday that his choice to fill a US Supreme Court vacancy, Harriet Miers, had withdrawn her nomination.
"Today, I have reluctantly accepted Harriet Miers's decision to withdraw her nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States," he said.
"My responsibility to fill this vacancy remains.
I will do so in a timely manner."
The move came as Bush languished at his worst level ever in public opinion polls and faced the possible indictment of senior aides in connection to a criminal investigation into the unmasking of a CIA agent in 2003.
The court wields enormous influence over American life as the final arbiter of the US Constitution and ultimate court of appeal, and has ruled on issues like abortion, the death penalty and civil rights.
Justices are named for life but can step down.
Bush had anointed Miers a longtime aide who serves as White House counsel, his official government lawyer on October 3 to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
But the nomination immediately ran into trouble, with widespread accusations that the president had picked a crony, as well as a revolt from Bush's right wing base supporters, who saw her as insufficiently conservative.
There was also a brewing battle between the Bush administration and the US Senate, which must confirm justices, over access to her legal writings at the White House and over whether Miers would have to answer questions about specific issues likely to come before the court.
The White House refused to provide the documents and insisted that Miers, who has never been a judge, would not answer any precise queries about her beliefs on volatile issues like abortion.
Miers, 60, will stay on as White House counsel and is expected to help the president choose his next nominee for the nine seat US Supreme Court, according to Bush spokesman Scott McClellan.
McClellan told reporters that Miers had telephoned Bush at 8:30 pm Wednesday (0030 GMT Thursday) to let him know she was withdrawing, and formally offered him her resignation letter in the Oval Office 12 hours later.
In the letter, which was released by the White House, Miers said she was "concerned that the confirmation process presents a burden for the White House and our staff that is not in the best interest of the country.
"I have steadfastly maintained that the independence of the executive branch be preserved and its confidential documents and information not be released to further a confirmation process," she said.
Had she been confirmed, Miers would have joined Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the second woman on the court and the third in its history.
With Harriet Miers' sudden withdrawal, President Bush likely will choose a U.S. Supreme Court nominee who is conservative enough to mend the rift with his Republican base and qualified enough to fend off attacks from Democrats, experts said Thursday.
In other words, regardless of gender or race, Bush may need another John G. Roberts Jr. to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
"John Roberts was the closest thing to perfect you are going to get," said Sen Lindsey Graham, R S.C., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that screens court nominees.
Bush promised to quickly name a replacement for Miers, the White House counsel who served as Bush's former personal attorney and president of the Texas Bar Association.
But with Bush's political troubles mounting, political and legal experts said the president must make a careful choice if he is to ease tensions and rally conservatives to his side.
Bush's public approval rating has sunk during the past few months with the continuation of violence in Iraq, high gasoline prices and the possibility that White House officials will be indicted today after a grand jury investigation of the leak of a CIA agent's identity.
Paul McGreal, a constitutional law professor at Houston's South Texas College of Law, said Roberts is the model to follow.
"With Harriet Miers, people were objecting on two fronts: She just didn't know enough about constitutional law, or there was not enough record to evaluate that, and conservatives didn't think she was one of them," he said.
"(Bush) needs to appoint someone with the public credentials of John Roberts a background and a record that people could look at and would have to say, 'Yeah, this person is qualified.'
But it also has to be someone who could meet the other credential for conservatives: 'Is he one of us?"'
Roberts, a conservative federal appeals court judge and a star appellate lawyer who had argued 39 cases before the high court and won 25 was confirmed last month to succeed the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
His paper trail appeared to be short because he had served on the bench only two years, but Roberts produced more than 70000 pages of written opinions, court briefs and other work demonstrating his familiarity with a wide variety of constitutional issues.
In meetings with senators and in four days of confirmation hearings, he wowed the Senate Judiciary Committee with his grasp of complex legal issues and his ability to cite from memory Supreme Court decisions and dissents.
Miers, on the other hand, is an accomplished corporate and government lawyer who has never been a judge and has rarely argued cases before appellate courts.
There are no opinions and very few legal briefs that could be used to assess her qualifications for the high court.
Miers said in a letter to the president that she was withdrawing to avoid burdening the White House with a struggle over access to documents on the advice she gave Bush as his government lawyer.
Senators indicated they would ask for the documents to help them gauge her qualifications, and Bush said this week he would refuse to provide them because they amounted to privileged information.
But beyond the issue of executive privilege, Miers faced attacks from conservative Republicans from the day of her nomination.
They accused Bush of cronyism and betrayal for picking his longtime friend over more solidly conservative candidates with stronger legal credentials.
Though no senator of either party had declared an intention to vote against her, Miers evidently concluded that her confirmation was unlikely or could be won only at severe personal cost.
"It's disappointing," said Sen John Cornyn, R Texas, "that this good person, that by any fair account is highly qualified, was not even given a chance for a hearing."
"This has been painful and difficult for everybody," said Wendy E. Long, counsel to the conservative Judicial Confirmation Network, which has worked to get Bush's past nominees confirmed but sat this one out.
"We initially tried to point out her virtues as a person, which we still stand by," Long said, "but the problem was there wasn't a whole lot to go on, or a whole lot in her record to fight with."
Long urged Bush to keep his campaign promise and select a nominee in the model of Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
"He campaigned twice for president and was very clear about what he was going to do, so it's no state secret," she said.
Asked who he would like to see nominated, Cornyn replied, "Anybody but me."
Bush and others have said they want wide representation on the Supreme Court a rationale for appointing a woman or a minority to replace O'Connor.
But most experts said it's more important for the president to pick an intellectually qualified nominee.
"My view is that there was zero pressure to appoint a woman or a minority when he appointed Harriet Miers," said Long.
"If the pressure was zero then, now it's utterly nonexistent."
Sen Dianne Feinstein, D Calif., the only woman on the Judiciary Committee, said it would be "a tremendous mistake" to appoint another member of the administration.
"It creates a perceived conflict," she said.
"Somebody has to have either the ability to entirely cut the umbilical cord or have no cord there in the first place."
Not two hours after the White House withdrew Harriet Miers's Supreme Court nomination Thursday morning, Trent Lott, R Miss., walked out of the Senate chamber with a spring in his step.
"I raised red flags the first day," the senator from I told you so said.
Asked if there was a sense of relief in the Republican caucus, Lott paused, smiled and, in his barbershop quartet bass, sang out to disbelieving reporters: "Happy Days Are Here Again!"
Senators came to bury Miers Thursday, not to praise her.
Republicans blamed the withdrawal on demands for White House documents.
Democrats blamed right wing ideologues.
But few seemed distraught that the nation would be spared the equivalent of a televised bar exam before the Senate Judiciary Committee next month.
As is customary, Sen Charles Schumer, D N.Y., was first to the microphones.
The first bulletins on Miers crossed the wires at 8:54 a.m.
At 9:32 a.m. Schumer announced a news conference for 10 a.m. "Harriet Miers is a fine and capable person, but this was clearly the wrong position for her," he announced.
Sen George Allen, R Va., was not far behind, at 10:22.
"I appreciate Harriet Miers's decision to withdraw," the conservative said.
The ostensible reason for the withdrawal what Miers called "protection of the prerogatives of the Executive Branch" from senators' demands for White House documents fell apart instantly.
"It wasn't only the documents," Miers's White House assigned shepherd, former senator Dan Coats, R Ind., told reporters outside the Senate chamber.
"Obviously you hope for unanimous support from your base when the president nominates someone, and that was lacking, as you know.
There were legitimate questions being asked about her background because she didn't have a paper trail."
Then there was the prospect of a week of grilling by the Judiciary Committee.
"She was," Coats added, "doing very well in her trial preparations."
Trial?
"Freudian slip," the shepherd explained.
It's understandable that Coats would be off message: Miers told Bush last night that she was dropping out, but nobody bothered to tell Coats.
"I got up this morning looking forward to more consultations," he said.
"When I arrived at the White House early, we went into a private office, and we had a discussion."
Reporters, expecting a routine day on the Hill, rushed to the Senate chamber in the morning for an otherwise unremarkable vote on a labor spending bill.
A trio of Judiciary Committee Republicans Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Mike DeWine of Ohio and John Cornyn of Texas gave impromptu news conferences.
Sessions was not distraught.
"I was concerned about the, uh, concern," he said.
"Probably she was worried about (it), too."
Cornyn, Miers's friend and most ardent Senate supporter, insinuated that the Democrats were to blame.
"I would just say it's part of unnecessary contentiousness and partisanship," he argued.
When a questioner pointed out that the objections came primarily from Republicans, Cornyn turned angrily.
"There is no Republican senator who opposed the nominee," he said.
"Your statement was wrong!"
The growls subsided when Cornyn, an hour later, was asked at another news conference about the possibility that he could be nominated to the high court.
"Well, you know, if the president calls me, obviously I'll answer the phone or go see him, if he invites me to come to the White House," he said.
Democrats, though they never committed to supporting Miers, lined up to blame the "right wing" (John Kerry), "the far right wing" (Byron Dorgan), "extreme right wing" (Dick Durbin), "extreme partisan pressure" (Mary Landrieu) and "extremists" (Ted Kennedy).
The Democrats got some help making this point from Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter, R Pa., who made a terse statement on the Senate floor.
Specter the man who suggested the nominee needed a "crash course in constitutional law" lamented the "one sided debate" and the "heavy decibel level against her."
Rebutting the White House line, Specter argued that "the Judiciary Committee carefully did not intrude on the president's executive privilege."
His three minute statement over, Specter left the chamber through a back door, evading the scrum of reporters waiting to ambush him.
Lott, the Senate Republican leader Bush helped to dethrone, was happy to talk.
And he didn't have anything nice to say.
On Bush's nominees: "I'm not going to just roll over and take everything he sends up here."
On Bush's consultations: "I don't think he got enough advice from the right people."
On Attorney General Alberto Gonzales for the court: "Forget that!"
Asked why Bush chose Miers, Lott replied: "There is Federalist Paper number 76.
I invite your attention to it: Be careful about home state, personal friends, cronyism."
Lott had more to say.
He branded Bush's aides "all young and inexperienced" and said senators had nobody to call at the White House.
"Karl Rove can't do it all by himself," Lott said.
Then a mischievous grin crossed the senator's face, and, alluding to the CIA leak case, he added: "And he may not be there."
Theatrically, Lott brushed his hands as if wiping off dust.
US President George W. Bush faces a delicate balancing act in nominating a new Supreme Court justice who will appeal to the religious right but not spark fierce Democratic opposition, following Harriet Miers's abrupt withdrawal.
Bush has said he will move "quickly" to select another candidate for America's highest court, after Miers withdrew from the process Thursday amid a firestorm of opposition from right wing lawmakers and religious groups.
Rattled by a CIA leak scandal that has targeted a top White House aide, and taking fire on Iraq and his administration's response to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Bush must confound suggestions of weakness and perceptions that his power is already ebbing, according to political analysts.
A Bush administration official, who requested anonymity, said the White House has gone back to reviewing a potential list of nominees that it had mulled before the president announced Miers as his pick on October 3.
Her nomination had run into trouble on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers suggested she lacked the votes necessary for confirmation to the United States' highest court.
Even lawmakers in Bush's own Republican Party had questioned Miers's conservative credentials and grasp of constitutional law.
Miers, Bush's White House counsel and a former Texas lawyer, said in a letter to Bush that she had withdrawn her nomination in order to protect the independence of the executive branch.
"I have steadfastly maintained that the independence of the executive branch be preserved and its confidential documents and information not be released to further a confirmation process," she said in the letter released to the media.
Supreme Court justices must be approved by the Senate, after being nominated by a US president, before they can take a seat on the court.
A vacancy opened up on the court after Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement from the nine member bench.
O'Connor has said she will stay on until a new justice has been approved to take her post.
Conservatives said Bush will now have to come up with a "winnable conservative nominee" for the court.
"The flow of blood has been stanched," said David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union.
"If he (Bush) comes up with a winnable conservative nominee, even if that person faces a fight in Congress, he will have drawn his people back to him," Keene noted.
Other conservatives said Miers's failed nomination had shown how out of touch the Republican president was with some of his key political supporters.
"What has come out of this episode is how really out of touch Mr Bush is with the intellectual foundations of the movement that he purports to represent," said Roger Pilon, director of the Center for Constitutional Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.
Some Supreme Court watchers, meanwhile, said Bush might have even less of a choice this time around as he vies to appoint a successful candidate to the court.
"The president appears to have less flexibility about what he does next, and the moderate Republican senators probably gain some power to determine the fate of a new nominee.
The Democrats, on the other hand, may not realize much advantage, if any," the Scotusblog.com website said in a posting.
Republican Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi played down Miers's failed nomination.
"Let's move on," he urged, adding: "In a month, who will remember the name Harriet Miers?"
The withdrawal of Harriet E. Miers from Supreme Court consideration was greeted Thursday with a blend of regret, relief and a general feeling that she had not been treated very well.
"This is a sad episode," said Sen Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee and who not long ago said Miers needed "a crash course in constitutional law."
"Whether or not she would have been confirmed is an open question," Specter said, voicing regret that Miers did not last long enough for a committee hearing, where "she would have had a major voice in determining her own future."
Democrats on the committee, while stopping far short of endorsing her, nonetheless expressed sympathy for the erstwhile nominee.
"The right wing effectively killed this nomination," Sen Dianne Feinstein of California said on CNN.
Feinstein said Miers "may not be the best thing since sliced bread" as far as her qualifications, but "I don't think she deserved the treatment she got."
Sen Charles E. Schumer of New York, another Judiciary Committee member, said, "Harriet Miers is a fine and capable person, but this was clearly the wrong position for her.
Her gracious withdrawal saves Harriet Miers and the nation from a difficult and agonizing process and decision."
Some senators said Miers had been the victim of bad handling by a White House that capitulated to people in the far right wing of the Republican Party who doubted the depth of her conservative beliefs.
Other senators, like Schumer, said the nomination had been bungled from the start, and that President Bush should never have chosen a person who was not qualified for the Supreme Court, whatever her other legal credentials and personal attributes.
"This nominee deserved better," said Sen Edward M. Kennedy, D Mass., a committee member.
While by no means indicating he would have voted for her, Kennedy said he respected Miers: "She has been a woman of achievement in her career."
The other Democrat from Massachusetts, Sen John Kerry, said President Bush had surrendered to "right wing interest groups" and let them determine the fate of Miers.
"This nomination was mishandled from the beginning," said Kerry, who is not on the Judiciary Committee.
"The president nominated someone whose qualifications he alone knew, then refused to disclose the only documents that would give the Senate even a hint of his nominee's judicial philosophy."
Sen George Voinovich, R Ohio, said, "Various groups, particularly on the Republican side, didn't give her the opportunity to share why she's qualified."
And Judge Robert H. Bork, who knows the pain of being nominated for the Supreme Court and never getting there, said, "We all have to have some sympathy for her."
Bork, who was rejected by the Senate in 1987, said in a CNN interview that Miers had been nominated for a position for which she was not really qualified.
"I think it was appropriate for her to withdraw," he said.
Fairly or not, the nomination of Miers was accompanied by charges of cronyism.
The White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, was asked Thursday whether it was a safe bet that the president's next choice would not be a White House employee.
"He will let you know who the next nominee is in due course," McClellan replied.
Saddened and surprised, friends and associates of Harrier Miers' in Texas blamed harsh attacks by the Christian conservatives, along with a bungled White House strategy to sell with her nomination, with sinking the Dallas attorney's nomination to the nation's highest court.
"I feel very proud of Harriet and at the same time sorry for her," said Darrell Jordan, a Dallas attorney.
"She is the most decent and honorable person in the world, and to have it end like this is very disappointing."
In Washington last week to stump for Miers with the Senate Judiciary Committee, Jordan said the White House committed several "gaffes," including touting Miers' religious background to appease Christian conservatives who criticized Bush's nomination.
"I wondered from the beginning why they were taking that approach.
It was a risky strategy," Jordan said.
Molly Steele, a former Dallas Bar Association president who worked with Miers, said she was sorry that her friend would not be allowed to bring her considerable legal skills as a trial attorney to the court.
"I think she would have been imminently fair and reasonable.
She would have been a centralist vote like (Supreme Court Justice) Sandra Day O'Connor," Steele said.
"It is obvious the next appointee could be a right wing ideologue like the base of the Republican Party wants."
At Locke Liddell & Sapp, the massive Dallas law firm where Miers worked before moving to Washington in 2001, the front lobby was virtually empty, the mood seemed somber.
"We're disappointed that our friend and colleague ,has withdrawn her nomination to be a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States, and that she never received a fair hearing," said a spokeswoman for the firm, Julie Gilbert, reading from a prepared statement.
"Harriet Miers has led a distinguished career, has an impeccable reputation, was extremely qualified and would have served the American people well," Gilbert said from the law firm's offices in Houston.
"We are proud of all Harriet Miers did for this law firm ,Professionally and personally, she remains a role model for us all," she said.
Cathie Adams of Dallas, president of the conservative group Texas Eagle Forum, credited Miers for doing "the right thing" by withdrawing.
"I think that she is not a conservative, ideologically," Adams said, "and I am disappointed in her embracing of too many facets of the feminist agenda, gender quotas in particular."
Adams said federal appeals court Judges Janice Rogers Brown and Edith Hollan Jones both have "conservative paper trails" suitable for nomination to the Supreme Court.
But, Adams said she would also support "another qualified gentleman because I don't think we have to have a gender quota."
Bush nominated Miers to the court a little more than three weeks ago, immediately angering members of the Christian right who said Bush had promised them a conservative court nominee in the mold of Supreme Court justices Clarence Thomas or Antonin Scalia.
Republicans and Democrats complained about her lack of judicial experience, and members of the Judiciary Committee sharply criticized Miers for not completely answering a questionnaire about her work at the White House.
The administration made available about 9000 pages of documents from Miers' tenure on the Dallas City Council and the Texas Lottery Commission, and Miers friends responded by pointing to her record as a "trailblazer."
Miers was the first woman hired by Lock Purnell Boren Laney & Neely, a blue chip Dallas law firm with roots back to the late 1800s.
She later became that firms managing partner, overseeing a team of more than 400 lawyers.
She also was the first woman president of the Dallas Bar Association in 1983, and the first woman president of the State Bar of Texas in 1992 93.
During her work with those groups and the American Bar Association, Miers earned high marks for reaching out to women and minorities and for working to improve legal services to the poor.
"Everybody who ever worked with her knew she was fair," Jordan said.
An outstanding lawyer and person, Miers would have been a fine Supreme Court justice, said Derek Davis, director of the J.M. Dawson Institute of Church State Studies at Baylor University.
Davis is an attorney who used to practice a few floors away from Miers.
He blamed "ultra conservatives" with destroying Miers' nomination because they insisted on having a justice that would change social policy in two areas: abortion and the trend of accepting homosexuality.
"They feel like they put George Bush into office and this was part of his promise to revamp the court.
But he's not revamping it in the way they want," Davis said.
Steele was on her way to breakfast with a friend Thursday when she heard that Miers had dropped out.
She said she had not yet talked to her friend.
"But I'm going to call and leave her a message and say we still love her and leave it at that," Steele said.

US President George W. Bush announced Thursday that his choice to fill a US Supreme Court vacancy, Harriet Miers, had withdrawn her nomination.
"Today, I have reluctantly accepted Harriet Miers's decision to withdraw her nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States," he said in a statement, adding: "My responsibility to fill this vacancy remains.
I will do so in a timely manner."
The surprise withdrawal of Miers's nomination comes just over three weeks after she was recommended for the high profile legal post by Bush on October 3.
Miers's nomination had run into trouble on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers suggested she lacked the votes necessary for confirmation to the United States' highest court.
And even lawmakers in Bush's own Republican Party had questioned Miers's conservative credentials and grasp of constitutional law.
Miers said in a letter to Bush that she had withdrawn her nomination in order to protect the independence of the executive branch.
"I have steadfastly maintained that the independence of the executive branch be preserved and its confidential documents and information not be released to further a confirmation process," she said in a letter to Bush released to the media.
Some lawmakers had requested internal White House documents in order to review Miers's legal background and get some insight into her philosophy.
Miers also highlighted her concern that "the confirmation process presents a burden for the White House and our staff that is not in the best interest of the country".
Bush said his White House counsel will continue to serve him in that post following her abrupt withdrawal.
Conservative activists crippled Harriet Miers's Supreme Court nomination largely by challenging her judicial philosophy, debating the importance of her religious beliefs, demanding to see White House documents and derailing her before she reached a Senate vote.
Those tactics might make it harder for them to defend President Bush's next pick, expected by many to be a solid conservative, according to a number of Democrats, independent analysts and even some conservative commentators.
They are struck by differences between the Miers nomination process and that of John Roberts, who was confirmed as chief justice a month ago.
When liberals mentioned a possible filibuster of Roberts, Republicans insisted on an "up or down vote," which Miers never received.
Virtually all GOP senators defended the White House's refusal to surrender documents concerning Roberts, but some of them demanded comparable documents regarding Miers.
And whereas Republicans said Roberts's religious beliefs should not be a subject of Senate inquiry, Bush cited Miers's church affiliation and religious convictions as one of her chief qualifications.
Now the Democrats may be in a stronger position to wage a filibuster or demand more detailed documentation and explanation of the next nominee's positions if they conclude he or she is out of the judicial mainstream.
"The Republican senators are changing every rule they attempted to set" in the Roberts confirmation, said Sen Edward Kennedy, D Mass., the Judiciary Committee's most senior member.
"They flip flopped on whether judicial philosophy and religious beliefs are appropriate" topics of Senate probing, he said.
"And they flip flopped on whether Harriet Miers deserved an up or down vote."
Marcia Greenberger, founder of the National Women's Law Center, said: "I don't know how people can, with a straight face, make some of the same arguments they made in the Roberts nomination after what they said so vociferously with Miers."
Some conservatives agree.
Commentator Hugh Hewitt, in a New York Times op ed column Friday, noted that several Senate Republicans campaigned in 2002 and 2004 on the "up or down vote" issue for judicial nominees.
"Now, with the withdrawal of Harriet Miers under an instant, fierce and sometimes false assault from conservative pundits and activists, it will be difficult for Republican candidates to continue to make this winning argument: that Democrats have deeply damaged the integrity of the advice and consent process," wrote Hewitt, a law professor at Chapman University in California.
Many of his fellow conservatives reject this argument.
"Harriet Miers was heading toward an up or down vote" when she decided to withdraw, said Brian McCabe, president of Progress for America, which backed Roberts and Miers.
He said there was no talk of a filibuster in which 40 of the Senate's 100 members can prevent a question from reaching a vote.
Nan Aron of the liberal Alliance for Justice disagrees.
Key Republican senators working quietly with the White House "orchestrated the withdrawal" of Miers, she said.
"They can no longer say that up or down votes are necessary in every situation," and that will undercut the argument that a Democratic led filibuster is out of bounds.
As for executive branch documents, the White House invoked attorney client privilege for both Roberts and Miers, conservatives noted.
But Democrats say it was GOP senators who were inconsistent.
They note that Sens David Vitter, R La., Sam Brownback, R Kan., Lindsey Graham, R S.C., and others called on the Bush administration to divulge more Miers related documents than it was willing to yield.
Bush's emphasis on Miers's religious convictions is more problematic for some conservatives.
"There were a lot of criticisms of that," conceded Ed Whelan, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank that criticized Miers.
"Some were put in a box trying to come up with arguments to sustain the nomination."
But for the most part, he said, conservatives have argued that a judicial nominee's religious beliefs should not be seen as a predictor of court rulings.
Whelan said Democrats will have little success if they try to score points on this issue in next confirmation fight.
But the liberal group People for the American Way already is trying.
Until recently, it said, the Republican right contended "that inquiring about a nominee's religious views was off limits" and "there should be no abortion 'litmus test' for confirmation,But shortly after the nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court, the Right all but abandoned these 'principles.'
" Some legal scholars say conservative activists and their Senate allies might have to explain why they pressed to know Miers's views on abortion and why they were openly troubled by her comments about "self determination" concerning school prayer and other issues.
"A lot of Republicans have put ideology on the table now by saying Harriet Miers wasn't a true conservative and by objecting that she wasn't clearly opposed to Roe vs. Wade," said Cass Sunstein, a constitutional law expert at the University of Chicago.
Whelan said Roberts easily handled these questions by showing he had a basically conservative outlook and a solid grasp of constitutional issues.
Bush's next pick presumably will have similar traits, he said.
"The lesson from this experience is how important it is to have someone with an objectively discernible judicial philosophy, and a sound one," Whelan said.
As for all the accusations of hypocrisy, he said, "Democrats may blow some smoke based on this, but I don't think there's any substance to it."
Conservatives on Thursday expressed relief that Harriet Miers has withdrawn as President George W. Bush's nominee to the Supreme Court, while liberals fretted that the White House might replace her with a more right leaning candidate.
Democrats who for the past few weeks mostly remained on the sidelines as Miers's troubled nomination ran further and further aground in Congress blamed conservative partisans for her withdrawal.
"The President has allowed right wing interest groups to decide the fate of his Supreme Court nominee, rather than stand up to his ultra conservative base," Democratic Senator John Kerry said.
"Its a telling statement about the instability and ideological confusion facing the White House and the Republican Party," Kerry said.
Another top Senate Democrat, Charles Schumer also blamed activism by "the very extreme wing of the president's party," and expressed hope that Bush would withstand conservative pressure in making his next pick to the court.
"If the president continues to listen to that extreme wing, on judicial nominations or everything else, it can only spell trouble for his presidency and for America," Schumer said.
Bush picked Miers, a longtime aide and currently White House counsel, on October 3 to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
Some critics have noted that she has no experience in matters of constitutional law and that she might not have had full command over the issues at play in a wide array of legal cases she would have been called upon to hear.
Right wing partisans were even more concerned that Miers was not sufficently conservative on social issues like abortion, however, and expressed relief Thursday at her withdrawal.
"We're just happy it's over," prominent conservative commentator Ann Coulter jubilantly told US television.
Conservative senator Jeff Sessions, who also applauded the decision to withdraw Miers, said prospects for her confirmation had not appeared promising.
"She would have had a lot of tough questions and the hearings would have been quite a challenge," the Republican lawmaker said.
Some said Miers's nomination might have been doomed as much by White House bungling as conservative activism.
"This nomination was mishandled from the beginning," Kerry said.
"If the president really believed Harriet Miers was the most qualified candidate for the Supreme Court, he made a terrible mistake refusing to fight for her and capitulating to the right wing."
Conservative Senator Trent Lott meanwhile agreed that there had been insufficient legwork by the White House leading up to the announcement of Miers's nomination.
"If they'd have bothered to check with some of their friends up here, they'd have said, 'Wait, wait, we're not sure about this nominee's qualifications.
Are you sure you want to do that?'"
Right wing commentator Bay Buchanan meanwhile, said the president now has the opportunity to salvage his reputation with conservatives by nominating a mainline rightwing partisan for the post.
"If he turns around with another Harriet Miers, he's going to turn a revolt into a revolution," she said.
But Schumer said he hoped the president now would make a clear, mainstream choice for the post whom both Democrats and Republicans could rally around.
"There is now one clear path for the president, to choose a knowledgeable and mainstream successor.
"These are very difficult times for the country and the nation cries out for unity," Schumer continued, in a direct appeal to Bush.
"Mr President, this is a time for leadership.
Please help bring America together with a choice that unites, not divides us."
A coal mine blast in northern China left at least 74 workers dead, the government said Thursday, marking the third massive coal mine disaster to hit China's perilous industry in recent weeks.
The latest incident comes despite repeated government safety crackdowns and pledges by the leadership to improve conditions.
China's mine are the world's deadliest, with accidents reported on a near daily basis.
The explosion Wednesday at the privately run Liuguantun Colliery in Tangshan, a city in Hebei province, occurred when 188 miners were underground, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
Xinhua said an earlier article that reported 186 miners were underground was incorrect.
An initial investigation showed that a mixture of airborne coal dust and gas known as fire damp ignited, causing the blast, Xinhua said.
Eighty two managed to escape on their own and 32 miners were immediately rescued but three of those later died, Xinhua said.
The bodies of 71 miners had been recovered from the mine by early Thursday, bringing the death toll to 74, it said.
Xinhua reported that an additional 32 miners remained missing but did not explain why these miners were not included in the figure for the total underground when the blast occurred.
Rescuers searching for miners in an unrelated blast in northern China last week struggled unsuccessfully for days to get an accurate count of how many miners were working when that blast occurred, underscoring the mismanagement and inattention to safety protocols that plague the industry.
Li Yizhong, director of the State Administration of Work Safety, and Zhao Tiechui, director of the State Administration of Coal Mine Safety, departed Beijing for the site late Wednesday, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
China churns out about 2 billion tons of coal a year, making it the world's largest coal producer followed by the United States which produces about 1 billion tons a year.
But China's mines are far deadlier.
More than 6027 people were killed in Chinese mines last year compared to the 28 reported killed in U.S. mines by the national Mine Safety and Health Administration.
The worst Chinese mine disaster in recent years occurred in February in northeastern Liaoning province, when an explosion killed 214 miners.
Corruption, lax safety rules and poor equipment are among factors often blamed for the accidents.
The government has shut down thousands of unsafe mines and punished mine owners who put profits ahead of lives.
But China's enormous need for energy, stemming from its booming economy, has complicated the issue.
On Tuesday, rescuers recovered the body of the last miner missing in a Nov 27 blast at the Dongfeng Coal Mine in China's northeastern Heilongjiang province, bringing the number of fatalities in that blast to 171.
The accident prompted Premier Wen Jiabao to declare over the weekend that the industry was "chaotic and without safety enforcement in place," according to Li Yizhong, the director of China's State Administration of Work Safety.
Rescuers at the Sigou Coal Mine in central Henan province were on Wednesday still trying to save 42 miners trapped underground after the shaft flooded last Friday, Xinhua said.
Divers have been dispatched for the search, and rescuers have also fed a microphone into the mine to listen for signs of life, Xinhua said.
So far, there has been no indication that the workers survived.
A total of 76 miners were working underground at the time, and 34 escaped.
Authorities have detained 10 of the mine's officials, including the owner, who had fled but was captured after a "massive manhunt," Xinhua said.
As part of the crackdown, punishments are often meted out to local mine or government officials, many who try to escape the scene.
Poor management and violation of working rules were responsible for a coal mine flooding that killed 14 miners a week ago in north China's Hebei Province.
The accident occurred at 4:30 a.m. on Nov 19 in the Yuanda Coal Mine in Neiqiu County of Xingtai City.
The 14 trapped miners down the pit died after a two day rescue operation failed, according to the provincial workplace safety department.
Although Yuanda is a licensed coal mine, it has serious problems and loopholes in work safety and management, the workplace safety department said.
This is the second fatal mine accidents in Xingtai this month.
Cave ins at three plaster mines on Nov 6 caused 33 deaths and left at least four missing.
Xingtai City has worked out rules to impose fines as much as one million yuan (12.34 million US dollars) on coal mines for each death in accidents, following the two fatal mine accidents.
The rules will be effective and implemented during a 100 day safety rectification campaign scheduled between Nov 21 and the end of February next year, according to the city government.
China has dismissed two provincial deputy governors and prosecuted 96 officials blamed for six high profile coal mine accidents that killed a total of 528 people over the past 13 months, the government announced Friday.
All six disasters were blamed on managers who failed to follow safety rules, sometimes with official collusion, the country's top industrial and mine safety officials said at a news conference.
The communist government has tried without success in recent years to reduce the carnage in China's coal mines, which are by far the world's deadliest, with more than 5000 deaths annually in fires, explosions and other disasters.
"We hope that all coal mines will learn from the bitter lessons these accidents have taught and will strengthen their safety precautions," said Li Yizhong, director of China's industrial safety agency.
Li complained that management standards at China's biggest state owned mines were deteriorating despite repeated official promises to improve safety.
He complained that operators of some small, private mines "don't respect life."
The deputy governors of Shaanxi province in the northwest and Guangdong in southern China were dismissed after being found partially responsible for mine accidents, according to Chen Changzhi, deputy minister of the Ministry of Supervision.
In addition, 96 officials were prosecuted and 126 other officials were demoted or fired, Li and the other officials announced.
Li said he didn't know what penalties the officials might face if convicted of criminal charges, but he said some possible offenses carry prison terms of up to seven years.
He said the most severe punishment that his department can impose is removing an official from his post.
In China's deadliest recent coal mine accident, at least 169 miners were killed when coal dust caught fire at the Dongfeng Coal Mine in Qitaihe, a northeastern city.
In February, an explosion in the Sunjiawan Coal Mine, also in China's northeast, killed 214 miners.
It was the country's deadliest reported mine accident since the 1949 communist revolution.
Aside from coal mines, China's fatality rate from other industrial accidents was falling, Li said.
Zhao Tiechui, deputy director of China's mine safety agency, appealed to the public and mine employees to report safety violations and accidents that mine managers try to cover up.
Regulators received 16 tips this year about attempts to cover up accidents that killed a total of 41 people, Zhao said.
The government has created a fund to pay whistleblowers up to 10000 yuan (US$1200, euro1000) for tips, Zhao said.
Such a reward is a huge sum in a country where the average worker makes about US$1000 a year, and many families get by on far less.
"We hope that with increased scrutiny by the public and the media, such coverup incidents will become less and less," Zhao said.
All 17 gas rich coal mines in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have been installed with advanced automatic gas monitors, in a bid to reverse the trend of increasing fatal accidents.
The Tiereke coal mine in the county of Baicheng is one of the 17 benefited from the advanced gas monitoring system.
Five other gas rich coal mines in the county have also been equipped with the similar apparatus.
Xinjiang has been suffering from high rate of fatal coal mine accidents, the regional production safety officials said.
In 2005, a total of 159 cases of fatal coal mine accidents took place across the region, claiming lives of 196 miners.
To reverse the embarrassing situation, the regional government has invested 17 million yuan (about two million US dollars) to set up an advanced gas monitoring system.
Xinjiang is rich in coal resources with forecast reserves between 1.82 trillion and 2.19 trillion tons, or 40.5 percent of China's total.
Central south China's Hunan Province is offering rewards to people who report illegal activities in its coal mining industry.
Cash rewards of up to 100000 yuan (about 12500 US dollars) will be given to people who report on government officials who illegally own shares in coal mines, according to Hunan provincial regulations issued on Sunday.
This follows the central government's crackdown on corruption in coal mining, an industry that kills more than 6000 workers in China every year.
People who report illegal coal mine operations and fraudulent cover ups of fatal accidents and dangerous operations will rewarded between 1000 yuan (125 dollars) and 10000 yuan (1250 dollars).
Coal mine operators have been accused of neglecting the safety of miners and authorities in the Beijing recently ordered that as least one mine manager or owner must go underground with the miners.
The State Council put new regulations into effect in September stipulating that leaders in counties and towns be demoted or removed from their posts if illegal coal mines are found to be operating in their jurisdiction.
China's safety supervisor said here on Sunday that by Dec 19, altogether 2411 coal mines had been closed down across the country due to safety problems.
The State Administration of Coal Mine Work Safety announced here on Sunday a namelist of the first batch of 1044 closed coal mines.
Among these closed mines, 59 were in Beijing, 125 in Hebei Province, 386 in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, 70 in Jiangxi Province, 58 in Hubei Province, and 135 in Sichuan Province.
According to regulations on coal mine work safety promulgated by the State Council, the Chinese cabinet, coal mines which failed to get safety licenses within a certain duration must stop production for rectification.
If they could not pass the safety check later, the mines should be shut down.
By Dec 19, altogether 12990 coal mines were ordered to stop production due to safety problems and 2411 of them have been closed down, said sources with the administration.
In recent years, the Chinese government has adopted a series of regulations and measures to improve coal mine safety.
But the situation remains grave, as official statistics showed that from January to September this year, 4228 people had been killed in 2337 coal mine accidents.
The National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration has set a timetable for solving problems related to the country's hundreds and thousands of small coal mines, the Economic Information Daily reported Tuesday.
Wang Xianzheng, deputy director of the administration, told a national meeting on coal science and technology, his administration aims to solve the small coal mine related problems within three years.
The registered legitimate small coal mines, which currently stand at 23000 in China, will fall to 19000, with the closing down of 4000 of them at the end of this year, Wang said.
These coal mines have a combined coal output capacity of 120 million tons, he added.
The number of small coal mines will drop further after undergoing regrouping and mergers, he said.
Wang also revealed that at present more than 10000 small coal mines have been ordered to suspend production for improvement because of lack of safe production licence applications.
Coal is China's major energy resource, accounting for 67 percent in the country's consumption structure of all primary energy resources.
In recent years, the Chinese government has issued a series of regulations and measures to improve coal mine safety.
But the situation is still grave.
Coal mine accidents occur one after another throughout the country.
Official statistics said that in the January September period of this year, 4228 people were killed in 2337 coal mine accidents.
Up to Oct 10, there were 43 major accidents nationwide.
A major accident means more than 10 deaths at one time.
Coal mine accidents killed 173 persons in northwestern Shaanxi Province by October this year, the provincial safety watchdog of coal mine production said Thursday.
The accident number and death toll saw a year on year increase of 18 and 42 percent respectively, highlighting the "severe situation" of the safety management in Shaanxi's coal mining industry, according to the provincial committee of industrial safety.
Coal producers in towns are most vulnerable to accidents due to poor safety guarantee facilities and the mine owners' indifference on safety operation rules, said an official with the provincial department of coal mine production, citing that more than 67 percent of the accidents and nearly 80 percent of the death toll were reported in these mines.
The production safety in the state owned collieries, however, has been given due attention and both the accidents number and death toll decreased 72 percent, said the official.
The provincial government has decided to strengthen the management and supervision on the coal producers and the private coal mines will be the major targets in a coming safety examination in December.
China will shut down 4000 small coal mines annually in the forthcoming three years, said Zhao Tiechui, head of the State Administration of Coal Mine Safety Supervision on Saturday.
Zhao made the remark at an on the spot meeting specially convened at Dongfeng Coal Mine, run by the Qitaihe branch of the Longmei Mining (Group) Co. Ltd. in Heilongjiang, where a major coal mine explosion took place on Nov 27, killing 169 miners so far.
"We can at most keep 10000 or so small coal mines," said Zhao, who also promised to drastically reduce the incidence of major accidents with coal mines in two years.
China now has 24000 small coal mines with the annual production output ranging from 10000 tons to 30000 tons, which account for 70 percent of the country's number of coal mining ventures.
The small coal mines have not only caused grave resource waste, with a low rate of recovery, which is averaged between 10 percent to 15 percent, but also serious pollution and higher incidence of accidents major, posing a long standing problem endangering safety at coal mines in the country, according to Zhao.
Those to be closed will include privately owned coal mines and state owned coal pits, and the methods such as restructuring and mergers will be adopted in the process of closure, said Zhao.
"Closing of small coal mines won't affect the country's demand for coal," said Zhao, adding the country had approved establishment of 13 large coal production bases each capable of turning out over 100 million tons of coal annually.
Rescuers at the site of a coal mine explosion that killed 150 people in northeast China now say an additional 33 miners may be missing, state television reported Wednesday.
The blast occurred Sunday at the Dongfeng Coal Mine in the Heilongjiang province town of Qitaihe and officials initially said 221 miners were underground at the time.
But records now show 254 were registered to be working and rescuers were trying to find the extra 33 people, China Central Television said.
The mine blast already ranks among China's deadliest, and the specter of a dramatically higher death toll further highlights the dreadful state of the nation's mining industry.
Mine accidents claim more than 5000 lives each year in China more than anywhere else in the world.
The government has unveiled one safety campaign after another as it repeatedly vows to stem the carnage.
But, the rate of large scale accidents is increasing, according to Hong Kong based China Labor Bulletin.
"Chinese coal miners are paying with their blood to support China's 8 percent annual economic growth," the group said.
"This is really too cruel and too heavy a price to pay."
In Qitaihe, there was a grim resignation.
"There's nothing we can do about it," said Zhang Yaowu, a former miner whose son Zhang Xianhe was killed in Sunday's blast.
"We need to work, and the work is dangerous.
We need to get on with life."
So far, 148 bodies have been recovered from the mineshaft, reports say.
Another two workers both women were killed above ground when coal dust in the mine ignited, the official Xinhua News Agency has said.
There was no official word on whether misconduct or human error was suspected.
More than 70 miners were rescued, reports have said.
The CCTV report didn't make clear whether there were other workers still missing beyond the 33 additional miners being sought Wednesday.
Many of China's mine disasters are blamed on managers who ignore safety rules or fail to install required ventilation or fire control equipment, often in collusion with local officials.
"This industry is too corrupt," said Yuan Yongqing, whose younger brother Yuan Yongcun was among the dead.
A veteran of two decades in the same mine, Yongcun was 48 years old and had a wife, son and daughter in law at home.
Coal mining dominates this town in China's Heilongjiang province, part of the region once known as Manchuria.
Slag heaps from dozens of coal pits dot the countryside.
Seeking to reduce mining deaths, the Chinese government has announced the creation of a national network of safety inspectors, stricter fire standards and shorter working hours for miners to prevent fatigue.
Authorities say they have shut down more than 12000 coal mines this year for inspections.
Thousands have been ordered to improve their facilities, and many others aren't expected to reopen.
But the death toll in China's mines continues to mount.
"As coal mine accidents happen again and again, and more workers lose their lives in the pits," said China Labor Bulletin, "we have to ask how effective are these emergency meetings, 'courageous and extraordinary' measures, and 'strong determination' in reducing the soaring number of coal mine accidents."
Despite government promises to stem the carnage, the death toll in China's disaster plagued coal mine industry is rising, according to the latest statistics released by the government Friday.
The official Xinhua News Agency reported that the industry suffered 2337 accidents that killed 4228 people between January and September this year.
According to earlier figures, fires, floods and other accidents in coal mines killed 4153 people in the first nine months of 2004.
"The government has issued a series of regulations and measures to improve the country's coal mine safety situation," the Xinhua said.
"However, the situation is still serious."
By Oct 10 this year there had been 43 coal mine accidents that killed 10 or more people, Xinhua said.
China's mines are said to be the most dangerous in the world, with more than 6000 miners killed last year in fires, explosions, floods, cave ins and other disasters.
The government says it has shut down hundreds of unsafe mines and punished mine owners who put profits ahead of lives.
The latest statistics were revealed Thursday at a Beijing conference focused on South African coal mine safety technology and equipment, Xinhua said.
Zhao Tiechui, director of the State Administration of Coal Mine Safety Supervision, has headed a team to central China's Henan Province to direct the rescue efforts of a coal mine gas explosion.
The administration also urged the provincial government to maintain the stability of the coal mine and make sure no more accidents occur during the rescue.
The provincial department of coal mine safety supervision must help the local government count the number of trapped miners and get relevant information of the mine, it required.
Supervision and inspection of coal mines must be strengthened to ensure the production safety of all the coal mines in the province in accordance with the regulations issued by the State Council, it said.
At least 34 miners were killed in a gas explosion in a coal mine in Hebi City, central China's Henan Province, early Monday morning.
The explosion occurred at 4:45 a.m. in a coal mine belonging to the Henan Hebi Coal (group) Company.
By 3:20 p.m. 34 people were found dead.
As a state run mining group, Hebi is one of the key major state owned enterprises in Henan.
Its total assets reached 4.636 billion yuan (565 million US dollars) last year.
China will close down a number of ill operated coal mines at the end of this month, said a work safety official here Monday.
The country's work safety authority will release the list of the first batch of coal mines to be closed down, said Wang Xianzheng, deputy director of the National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration.
Before this bid, the bureau had ordered 8648 coal mines which failed to renew their work safety certificates to stop operation for safety checks due to the frequent blasts and accidents took place in coal mines throughout the country.
Describing the closing of the mines as the most difficult part in the prevention process of coal mine accidents, Wang expected to confront resistance as the closing will certainly hurt the interests of the coal mine owners, as well as those who have benefits in that.
According to Wang, most provincial level authorities have submitted their specific steps for coal mine safety check to the bureau, "But many of them only give vague plans only with deadlines set as late December."
The bureau had already required them to report more detailed plans, said Wang.
"All the coal mines that fail to pass the check will be closed down this year," he said.
However, the closing acts should be carried out exactly according to laws and may employ law enforcement, he said.
Two more mine accidents left at least 16 dead and 22 missing in China, state media said Wednesday, continuing a black week for the industry, which has been rattled by four deadly disasters.
At least 10 miners were killed and 18 more were missing after a coal mine in southwest China flooded late Tuesday.
The tragedy, which happened at the Longtan Coal Mine in Sichuan province, coincided with six people being killed by an unknown gas at an illegal pit in northeast Liaoning province, Xinhua news agency reported.
So far this week, four mine disasters have claimed the lives of at least 60 workers and left 26 others missing.
Survivors are rarely found from the regular gas explosions that rock mines in China, but the chances of finding people alive in floods have proven to be be marginally better.
Nine escaped from the molybdenum mine in the Gangtun township of Liaoning and were arrested, Xinhua said, while four were reported missing.
Molybdenum is a silvery white metal used in making alloys and electrodes.
While much of China was shut down for the National Day holiday week, the unrelenting demand for coal to drive the country's booming economy and rapid industrialization forces many mines to remain open, around the clock.
It is the voracious demand that results in so many accidents, with safety procedures ignored in the quest for profits.
On Monday, 34 miners were killed and 19 injured in a gas explosion at a pit in the central province of Henan.
The mine was operated by a large state run enterprise the Henan Hebi Coal company but even it ignored safety procedures, government officials admitted.
In a statement Wednesday, the National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration said problems existed in gas ventilation management and workplace management at the mine as well as production safety.
According to the bureau, the Henan mine was operating with outdated equipment.
It ordered the company, which had assets worth 4.6 billion yuan (567 million dollars) in 2004 and runs eight major mines with annual production at over seven million tons, to close all its pits to check safety equipment.
The demands follow an order from Premier Wen Jiabao on Tuesday for mine bosses to do more to prevent accidents.
His comments came after a gas blast in the northwest Xinjiang region at the privately run Yateur mine, in which 10 workers died and four others remained missing.
Rescuers said there was little hope anyone would be found alive.
China relies on coal for two thirds of its energy needs and is not expected to shift significantly to other fuel sources for years to come.
In an attempt to improve safety, China in August ordered 7000 coal mines to suspend operations by the end of the year.
But critics argue that shutdowns only exacerbate coal shortages and force mines elsewhere to increase capacity at the expense of safety.
Violation of safety rules was attributed to Sunday's deadly colliery gas blast that killed 16 persons in Taiyuan of Shanxi Province, investigators said here Tuesday.
The accident happened at Taiping Coal Mine of Qingxu County, when 25 persons were working underground.
Mine of them managed to escape.
The small township coal mine, with an annual production capacity of 60000 tons, has all valid documents for production.
Shanxi is the biggest coal production base in China.
In the provincial capital of Taiyuan alone, 28 coal mine accidents have happened so far this year, killing 53 people.
With an aim to halt the repeated coal mine accidents, the city government has ordered all the 84 coal mines and 319 mine shafts in the city to suspend operation before Nov 10 for rectification.
836 officials and state owned enterprise (SOE) leaders have abandoned their coal mine investments in north China's Shanxi province, a major coal producing region, amid a nationwide crackdown on illegal coal mine investment by officials.
According to the provincial government, those officials and SOE leaders have relinquished coal mine investments worth more than 40 million yuan (nearly 5 million US dollars).
On Aug 30, China issued a circular requiring all officials and SOE leaders with coal mine investments to withdraw their stakes, setting Sept 22 as the deadline.
It said if the officials refused to relinquish the illegal investments, they would be removed from their posts.
The circular was issued against the backdrop of frequent coal mine accidents in China.
Li Yizhong, director of the National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration, has said the collusion between mine owners and officials is to be condemned.
Some coal mines are owned or partly owned by local officials.
These mines always escape inspection and become black holes devouring miners' lives, he said.
Statistics show that China recorded some 2700 mining fatalities in the first half of this year, 3 percent higher than last year.
The 24 most deadly accidents claimed a total of 704 lives, a year on year increase of 114 percent.
In the first seven months, Shanxi witnessed 90 coal mine accidents in which 316 lives were lost.
The six deadliest accidents occurred at illegally operated coal mines, claiming 183 lives.
Investigation of these accidents showed that some officials collaborate with mine owners to make illegal coal mines appear to be legal.
Up to Sept 30, reports from 11 Shanxi cities showed that 922 officials and SOE leaders were involved in coal mine businesses, with a total investment of over 92 million yuan (11 million US dollars).
According to Li, national figures about officials and SOE leaders who relinquished coal mine investments will be released in mid October.
Fatal coal mine accidents in China rose 8.5 percent in the first eight months of this year, with thousands dying despite stepped up efforts to make the industry safer, state media said Wednesday.
The figures were released as the government and state media reported another deadly blast, this time at an illegal coal mine in northern China on Monday in which 17 people died.
Citing government statistics, Xinhua news agency said coal mine fatalities had increased 8.5 percent in the first eight months of 2005 compared with the same period last year, without giving the total number.
More than 6000 miners died in accidents in China last year, according to previously released government figures.
Independent estimates say the real figure could be as high as 20000.
China's coal mining industry, driven by the huge demand to fuel the nation's power plants and drive its rapid industrialization, is regarded as the most dangerous in the world.
China relies on coal for two thirds of its energy needs and production has spiralled in recent years as the economy has expanded at breakneck speed.
The government intends to increase coal production to 2.4 billion tons by 2010, up from 2.1 billion currently, Xinhua said on Wednesday.
Official efforts to make mines safer have largely failed because mine owners simply reopen closed pits illegally, critics say.
Officials often turn a blind eye to the illegal operations as many people in authority, even those in charge of inspecting mines, own stakes in the lucrative businesses.
Xinhua revealed on Wednesday that a government investigation had found 4578 officials nationwide had stakes in coal mines, with the amount of capital invested totalling 653 million yuan (80.5 million dollars).
The government earlier this year began forcing officials to withdraw investments in mines to reduce the number of accidents.
Some officials acted as coal mine owners themselves, while others accepted bribes from mine owners when issuing permits, and helped mines hide death tolls when accidents occurred.
Monday's blast occurred at the Fenhemao Coal Mine in Changlianggou town, Yuanping city of Shanxi province, and reportedly followed a familiar pattern with the mine operating illegally.
The blast at the mine killed all 13 miners working underground at the time, the State Administration for Work Safety said on its website.
Mine management immediately sent a team of six rescuers down the pit, but two rescuers suffocated.
The blast also damaged a neighboring mine and killed two people there, Xinhua said.
The small village run mine had been ordered to shut down from October 1 to December 31 because it failed to meet safety standards and had expired production permits, Shanxi news website quoted local officials as saying.
But the mine remained opened, closing only briefly during inspections, the website quoted workers as saying.
Local authorities had visited the mine on the morning of the blast to make sure it had stopped production but it resumed operations after the inspectors left, workers said.
The owner of the mine, Han Buhong, has fled, the website said.
With its coal mining safety a hot issue attracting wide attention from both home and overseas, China is seeking solutions from the world to improve its coal mining safety system.
The Conference on South African Coal Mining Safety Technology and Equipment held here Thursday provides an opportunity for Chinese coal mine production personnel to learn from their South African counterpart in the area of coal mining safety.
At the conference, experts in the coal mining industry from South Africa showcased their technology and equipment in mining safety and shared their expertise and experience in coal mine management.
Wang Shuhe, deputy director of the State Administration of Coal Mine Safety (SACMS) said that the mining industry is well developed in South Africa.
So China could learn much from the country which has a complete safety system and mines rescuing system.
According to Gu Tao, Senior Engineer with the Communication and Information Center of the SACMS, the cooperation between China and South Africa has a long history in the coal mine industry.
China has bought over 40 mining communication equipments from the country so far.
"I have learned about China's coal mining safety situation from news.
The mining safety technology and equipments have been sold to countries such as the United States and Australia.
We hope that our cooperation with China could help improve working conditions of Chinese coal mine workers," said Mthokozisi MA Zondi, deputy chief inspector of mine, the Department of Minerals and Energy of South Africa.
According to Kuang Mahua, deputy division chief of the Department of Regulations and Liaison, the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs, trade of technology has become the main technology communication mode between China and other countries.
"China's coal mine safety improvement efforts have provided a big market for the world.
This conference is only a start.
We will hold more such communications between China and countries advanced in coal mine safety technology and management experience such as Australia in the future," he said.
Coal is the major energy resource in China, covering 67 percent in the country's consumption structure of all primary energy resources.
In recent years, The government has issued a series of regulations and measures to improve the country's coal mine safety situation.
However, the situation is still serious.
According to statistics, from January to September this year, the total number of coal mine accident is 2337, with 4228 people dead.
Up to October 10, there were 43 major accidents this year.
A major accident means more than 10 deaths at one time.
China's coal mine safety watchdog has ordered the closing down of at least 4000 coal mines, the People's Daily reported on Tuesday.
The move comes in the wake of a series of coal mine and coal mine related accidents across the country which claimed dozens of lives between Nov 3 and 8.
Zhao Tiechui, director of the National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration, revealed on Monday that so far, 12148 coal mines have been ordered to suspend production for rectification.
Among them, 1870 were closed for safety reasons.
Coal is the major energy resource in China, covering 67 percent of the country's consumption structure of all primary energy resources.
In recent years, the Chinese government has issued a series of regulations and measures to improve coal mine safety.
But, the situation is still grave.
Official statistics said that from January to September this year, 4228 people were killed in 2337 coal mine accidents.
Up to Oct 10, there were 43 major accidents nationwide.
A major accident means more than 10 deaths at one time.
A total of 4578 officials nationwide have admitted they have stakes in coal mines, with total capital of 653 million yuan.
Some 473 million yuan have been withdrawn by Oct 20.
It was announced by Chen Changzhi, vice Minister of Supervision, on Tuesday at a press conference jointly organized by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Ministry of Supervision, the Commission for Supervision and Management of State owned Properties and the National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration.
Forcing officials to withdraw investment in coal mines is widely regarded as an important step to curb frequent coal mine accidents.
Investigation showed that a large number of coal mine accidents occurred because unlawful and unsafe coal mines were given a green light to operate by local governments after officials obtained stakes in the coal mines.
In the first eight months, the death toll of coal mine accidents across China rose 8.5 percent from the same period last year.
In particular, the death toll of major coal mine accidents, defined as having cost at least 10 deaths, went up 168.2 percent compared with the same period last year.
On March 14, 18 miners died in a coal mine explosion in Qitaihe County of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
Police found that the coal mine owner was actually a deputy director of the local work safety watchdog.
In August, China issued a circular requiring all officials who had invested in coal mines to retract stakes.
Five inspection groups, dispatched by the central government, went to 10 provinces to oversee officials to retract their stakes in coal mines.
Special leading groups were set up in every province, responsible for handling registration of officials' stakes in coal mines.
Li Yizhong, director of the National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration, said "The deals between power and money, conducted by coal mine owners in collusion with local officials, were unbearably rampant."
Some officials bought coal mine stakes to obtain bonuses, some acted as coal mine owners themselves, some accepted bribes from coal mine owners when issuing coal mine operation permits, some acted as protective shields for coal mine owners after accepting bribes and some helped coal mine owners hide death tolls when accidents occurred, Li said.
Chen said officials who refused to register their stakes in coal mines within the required time limit or pretended to withdraw stakes but actually still held the stakes, would be removed from their posts.
Li disclosed that citizens who offer important clues on illegal investment by officials in coal mines will be awarded, in order to stimulate citizens to play a bigger role in combating government corruption.
Russian sailors rescued with British help after three days trapped in a mini submarine deep in the Pacific revealed Monday how they struggled with rapidly decreasing water and oxygen supplies while waiting anxiously in the darkness and cold.
The seven men had only six hours of oxygen left when they finally reached the surface, said Commander Ian Riches, the British naval officer who directed the effort to use a remote controlled Scorpio underwater vehicle to free the submarine from fishing nets.
Strolling in the sunshine outside a military clinic, dressed in blue hospital uniforms, the submariners offered the first glimpse of the conditions for the seven men inside the cramped 13.4 meter (44 foot) submarine, snagged by cables in 180 meters (590 feet) of water off Russia's remote Pacific coast.
"The main thing was the lack of water.
There was also a problem with oxygen, not critical but the body felt it was not enough," crew member Alexander Uibin said in footage broadcast on Rossiya television.
The Interfax news agency quoted a medical official in Kamchatka as saying that the crew only had three or four gulps of water a day.
The official, who was not identified by name, said the submariners had written farewell letters to their families several hours after their vessel became stranded on Thursday, the report said.
"We understood we were trapped.
We just had to wait for a decision.
When they said that they've put everything into action, we lay flat and began to wait," said Gennady Volonin, a representative of the company that made the AS 28 mini submarine who was on board with six submariners.
The men had worn thermal suits to protect them against temperatures of about 5 C (40 F) and were told to lie flat and breathe as lightly as possible during the rescue effort, officials said.
To conserve electricity, lights were turned off and contact with the surface was kept to a minimum.
The Scorpio, sent in response to Russia's urgent call for help, arrived Saturday and spent six hours the next day cutting away the fishing net cables that had snarled the Russian vessel and its propeller.
After breaking free, a few anxious minutes followed before the vessel floated up to the surface, and the seven men climbed out onto the deck.
"The team are over the moon that we have got these guys out alive," said Riches as he arrived ashore at Petropavlovsk Kamchatsky in the early hours of Monday.
Russian authorities thanked the British and praised the international rescue effort that included the United States, having appealed for help in a significant gesture to its former Cold War enemies.
But Moscow newspapers still criticized the Russian navy for waiting more than a day before revealing the submarine accident, accusing it of failing to learn the lessons of the 2000 Kursk submarine disaster and not investing necessary funds in upgrading rescue capabilities.
The Kommersant daily reported that the news only leaked out after a submariner's wife made an anonymous call to a radio station in Kamchatka on Friday morning nearly 24 hours after the mini sub radioed an emergency signal.
Later that day, Russia asked Japan, Britain and the United States for help.
When the Kursk nuclear submarine sank in August 2000, Russian authorities held off asking for outside assistance until hope was nearly exhausted, all 118 crew members died.
"As with the Kursk, the navy command tried to cover up information about the accident, trying to deal with it themselves," the Gazeta daily wrote.
"Only when the situation got critical did the navy top brass appeal to foreign countries for help."
President Vladimir Putin was criticized at the time of the Kursk sinking for reluctance to seek international help and for remaining on vacation as the disaster unfolded.
As of Monday, he had made no public comment on the mini sub drama.
Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov defended the navy's rescue capabilities, saying Russia has a robotic vehicle similar to the Scorpio deployed at the Northern Fleet.
He said disassembling it for transport to an airport and then flying it across the sprawling country would have taken longer than it took for the British vessel to arrive.
But the Pacific Fleet commander, Adm. Viktor Fyodorov was quoted by Interfax on Monday as saying that despite boasting a powerful submarine fleet, the Russian navy did not have the proper resources to mount underwater rescue operations.
Putin ordered the defense minister to launch an investigation and Kommersant reported Monday, citing military sources, that navy chief Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov faced dismissal after this latest embarrassment for the fleet.
Later Monday, Putin called British Prime Minister Tony Blair to express his gratitude for the British contribution to the rescue, the Kremlin said in a statement.
President Vladimir Putin on Sunday fired the head of Russia's Navy, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, and called on the new commander to boost discipline in Russia's flagging fleet.
Putin did not give a specific reason for firing Kuroyedov.
But he indicated that the admiral was bearing the blame for a series of tragedies in the Russian navy.
Last month, a mini sub with seven men aboard was trapped at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.
The Navy had no means of rescuing them without emergency help from abroad.
Kuroyedov had presided over the Navy as it has suffered tragedy including the 2000 Kursk submarine sinking that killed 118 crew members and embarrassment, including his statement last year that a Russian nuclear powered missile cruiser was in such dire condition that it could explode at any moment.
He was forced to retract the statement.
Putin named Adm. Vladimir Masorin to replace Kuroyedov.
At a meeting at his suburban residence with the two admirals and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov, Putin told Kuroyedov that the Navy he inherited when he took command in 1997 was in poor shape and that it had showed signs of improvement.
"At the same time, there were difficult events, tragedies," Putin said during the meeting, which was attended by reporters.
"But I would like to underline once again that with all these problems, all these tragedies, the main thing is that the Navy is undergoing a revival."
He told Masorin that he faced a difficult task, in spite of progress.
"We have seen the level of training of Navy pilots and sailors, which has grown.
Many naval ships have been repaired and others were launched and some of them were already commissioned," Putin said.
"We would not be able to solve all these problems even with the state's economic potential growing if we do not strengthen discipline and order and solve tasks of social protection of seamen."
Unlike the Kursk sinking, the August mini sub crisis ended with all seven crewmen surviving unhurt thanks to an underwater robotic vehicle sent from Britain.
The need for foreign help underlined the troubles of a Navy that once was formidable but has fallen prey to money shortages and, many critics say, poor leadership.
Sea rescue vehicles were among the first Soviet built vessels to be scrapped amid the desperate funding shortages that followed the 1991 Soviet collapse, but the Kursk tragedy had prompted promises that rescue vehicles would be given priority.
But in August 2003, nine members of a 10 man crew died when the submarine they were in sank in gale force winds in the Barents Sea as it was being towed to a scrapyard.
Kuroyedov said at the time that the sinking could have been avoided easily and there had been several chances to save the crew.
He blamed lower ranking officials for disregarding safety rules.
Putin on Sunday presented orders for bravery to the seven mini sub crewmen and state awards to eight foreigners five Britons, one Japanese and two Americans who assisted the rescue effort.
Putin's order said the foreigners' awards were "for the self sacrifice and high professionalism show during the rescue of the Russian seamen."
Russia has decided to buy two deep diving Scorpio rescue vehicles to boost its rescue capabilities following a submarine accident that trapped seven crewmembers for three days after the mini submarine got entangled with fishing nets and an antenna on the Pacific seabed.
Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov decided to buy two remote controlled, deep diving Scorpio underwater vehicles for the Russian navy, Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Viktor Fyodorov told the Itar Tass news agency Tuesday.
The AS 28 mini submarine, itself meant for rescue operations, got ensnarled Thursday night by fishing nets and an antenna of Russia's coastal monitoring system on the seabed off the Kamchatka Peninsula and was lifted to surface Sunday with all the crew members alive.
The crew was salvaged at the end of an around the clock rescue operation that was assisted by a British Scorpio underwater vehicle, which was submerged to cut the entanglements.
Russia was quick to ask for international help after the accident occurred.
Britain and the United States airlifted Scorpio submersibles to join the rescue work.
The lobster shaped Scorpios are equipped with black and white video cameras, two robotic arms that can each lift about 250 pounds and a cable cutter that can slice through 2.54 cm thick steel cables.
The British Scorpio played a key role in the operation to free the submarine, Fyodorov said.
The decision to buy Scorpios came a day after Fyodorov underlined the need to have efficient rescue equipment in the wake of the submarine accident.
The Russian navy "has advanced submarines but does not have efficient rescue vehicles," he said Monday.
"If we had had a rescue vehicle of this kind, we could have rescued the mini submarine within a day," Fyodorov said.
Russian crewmen walked ashore unsteadily, rescued from a three day ordeal after their mini submarine surfaced with all seven crew members safe after being trapped deep under the Pacific Ocean in the frigid darkness.
"It was cold, cold, very cold.
I can't even describe it," one crew member with reddish hair said as the sailors walked ashore Sunday with dazed looks and bloodshot eyes after their submarine was cut loose from fishing net cables that had snagged it by a British remote controlled rescue vehicle.
Commander Ian Riches, the British Royal Navy officer who led the successful operation using the remote controlled Super Scorpio, hailed the joint rescue mission with the Russian Pacific Fleet as a "marvelous example" of international cooperation.
"It was a difficult operation, but we enjoyed doing it," he said as he arrived ashore at Petropavlovsk Kamchatsky in the early hours of Monday local time "The team are over the moon that we have got these guys out alive," he added, saying he was "elated."
The men aboard the AS 28 mini submarine six sailors and a representative of the company that made the ship opened the hatch and climbed out without assistance, officials said.
Six were taken to a hospital on the mainland for examination, waving to relatives as they went in.
The seventh was kept aboard a hospital ship for unspecified reasons.
They appeared to be in "satisfactory" condition, naval spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo said.
At the edge of the gangplank leading off the ship that brought the crew to shore, the submarine's commander Lt. Vyacheslav Milashevsky held a long and solemn salute, then a slight smile crossed his face.
He was pale but told journalists he felt "fine" before climbing into a van with the others for the trip to the hospital.
Another crew member in the van looked from side to side, gazing at the green trees and gray skies.
Milashevsky's wife, Yelena, said earlier that she was overjoyed upon hearing about the rescue.
"I was happy.
I cried from happiness.
I danced," she told Channel One television.
The men had worn thermal suits to protect them against temperatures of about 4.4 degrees Celsius (40 degrees Fahrenheit) and were told to lie flat and breathe as lightly as possible during the rescue effort, officials said.
To conserve electricity, lights were turned off and contact with the surface was kept to a minimum.
The crew member with reddish hair said he felt OK and was eager to be reunited with his wife and daughter.
He was then ushered into the van taking the men to the hospital and did not reply when asked his name.
Russian authorities thanked the British and praised the international rescue effort that included the United States, but criticism quickly arose over why the nation's once formidable navy needed outside help.
The relief over the successful rescue attempt was in sharp contrast to the sinking of the Kursk nuclear submarine in August 2000, when Russian authorities held off asking for outside assistance until hope was nearly exhausted, all 118 crew members died.
President Vladimir Putin was criticized then for reluctance to seek international help and for remaining on vacation as the disaster unfolded.
The president has been silent through the present crisis as well, although his spokesman Alexei Gromov said Putin was grateful to all those involved in the rescue operation.
Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov, who supervised the rescue operation from a navy ship, clenched his fists and shook them in happiness when he saw the red and white striped sub surfacing.
"We have seen in deeds, not in words, what the brotherhood of the sea means," he said.
The Foreign Ministry also issued a statement praising the joint actions of the Russian, British and U.S. militaries in the "unique rescue operation."
It also thanked Japan, which it said also responded to the request for help.
The United States sent remote controlled underwater vehicles for the rescue.
They arrived several hours later and were not used, but three American divers and a doctor accompanied the British vessel on its mission.
The jubilation came after three tense days that started Thursday when the 13.4 meter (44 foot) submarine got stranded in 180 meters ( 590 feet) of water about 15 kilometers (10 miles) off Kamchatka's east coast.
Russian ships first tried to tow the sub to shallower water where divers could reach it but were able to move it only about 80 meters (90 yards) in Beryozovaya Bay.
The British Super Scorpio, sent in response to Russia's urgent call for help, arrived Saturday and spent six hours the next day cutting away the fishing net cables that had snarled the Russian vessel and its propeller.
Riches said the most nerve racking point in the operation was when the Russian submarine broke free from the cables and disappeared from the camera's sight before surfacing about 4:26 p.m. "She moved and we lost her out of the camera,and it was then waiting on the surface waiting for her to arrive.
Whether she's going to make it all the way up, we didn't know where she was after that.
That was really the tensest moment," he said.
The circumstances surrounding the cause of the accident remained unclear.
Putin ordered the defense minister to launch an investigation.
Dygalo declined comment when asked about how the sub was trapped, saying only that it had been "engaged in planned maneuvers."
Some naval officials had said the submarine was participating in a combat training exercise when it got caught on an underwater antenna assembly that is part of a coastal monitoring system.
But Riches, the British commander, said the vessel had become tangled in fishing nets, as had been originally reported.
"The submarine was caught very firm into the fishing nets and had driven into them so that they were very tight and they actually looked and behaved like steel wires, so it was very, very difficult to cut through with cutting implements," Riches told The Associated Press.
Russia's cash strapped navy apparently lacks rescue vehicles capable of operating at the depth where the sub was stranded.
The new crisis indicated that Putin's promises to improve the navy's equipment have had little effect.
He was sharply criticized for his slow response to the Kursk crisis and reluctance to accept foreign assistance.
New criticism arose within hours of Sunday's rescue.
Dmitry Rogozin, head of the nationalist Rodina party in the lower house of parliament, said he would demand an assessment from the Military Prosecutor's Office of the navy's performance in the incident, the Interfax news agency reported.
Rogozin said he wants to know why Russia has not acquired underwater vehicles similar to the ones provided by Britain and the United States and "why fishing nets and cables litter the area of naval maneuvers."
Violations of operating procedures caused the Russian mini submarine to be stranded on the Pacific seabed for three days last month, Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said Tuesday citing results of a probe into the accident.
"A scrupulous investigation into the accident has been conducted within a month's time, as was promised.
It was established that outrageous violation of the instructions by senior officials of the Russian Pacific Fleet was the main cause of wrong 'swimming and diving rounds'", Ivanov told reporters, the Itar Tass news agency reported.
The AS 28 mini submarine was ensnarled on the Pacific seabed off the Kamchatka Peninsula for nearly three days in early August and was eventually lifted to surface with all crew members alive in a rescue operation aided by a deep diving British Scorpio rescue vehicle.
Newly appointed Navy Commander in Chief Vladimir Masorin said Monday investigators of the accident found the crew had made errors operating the craft.
Masorin also said the navy is considering buying a Scorpio submersible rescue vehicle.
The small Russian submarine rescued Sunday had become trapped beneath the Pacific when an old fishing net disabled its propeller and tied the vessel to an undersea Russian surveillance device larger than a drive in movie screen, according to American divers who helped save the boat's seven crew members.
The divers, who spoke by telephone shortly after returning to San Diego Monday, said the submarine had been knotted so tightly against the listening device that a British submersible could not maneuver close enough to clip all the netting during the tense, five hour operation to free the craft.
Instead, after the British vessel's robotic arm had snipped most of the snarled netting, Russian commanders on a nearby ship ordered the submarine's crew to blow pressurized air through its ballast tanks.
That lightened the submarine, the divers said, and propelled it upward with enough force to break the last thick strands of nylon pinning it down.
Four U.S. Navy divers were on a ship to help with the rescue.
In telephone interviews, two of them said the Russian vessel floated to the surface from a depth of 625 feet off Russia's Kamchatka peninsula.
Though the ascent was uncontrolled, it popped safely to the surface between two rescue ships "out of pure luck," said one of the divers, Lt. Cmdr. Gerard Demers.
The account by the divers helped to sort out contradictory reports by Russian officials during the three day race to reach the submarine before the sailors, huddled in the cold and dark, ran out of air.
After the 44 foot long vessel became trapped Thursday, Russian fleet commanders first said it was entwined in a fishing net.
But by Friday, some officials had shifted to saying that it was snagged on cables connected to an undersea antenna meant to detect foreign submarines lurking off a major Russian naval base nearby.
The device is thought to be a large hydrophone, which scans the depths for the sounds of submarines, and it seems to be a vestige of Cold War cat and mouse games beneath the sea.
The divers, from the Navy's Deep Submergence Unit in San Diego, flew to the site on Friday with tons of rescue gear, including two American submersibles.
The British vessel arrived first, and the American divers accompanied it to the rescue scene.
Western officials have said the Russian sailors were rescued about three to six hours before they would have run out of air.
Russia's naval chief of staff said Friday that the navy will buy a remote controlled underwater vehicle similar to the one flown in by Britain to help free a mini submarine that was trapped with seven men aboard deep in the Pacific Ocean.
Although the seven survived the four day ordeal, the accident and Russia's appeal for outside help underlined the navy's insufficient equipment.
Adm. Vladimir Masorin said the navy would buy a US$3 million (euro2.5 million) Panther, which he described as a more modern device than the Scorpio sent by Britain that succeeded in cutting through cables that had snagged the mini sub.
On Tuesday, Pacific Fleet commander Adm. Viktor Fyodorov said Russia would buy two Scorpios, but Masorin's announcement indicated that the Panther would be bought in place of one Scorpio.
The RIA Novosti news agency quoted Masorin as saying Russia tried to deploy a remote controlled underwater vehicle called a Venom at the accident site, "but when they started to use it, they used it incorrectly it was spoiled by our people."
Seven sailors rescued from a mini submarine hours before their air supply would have run out faced a new problem Monday: Confined to a hospital, they wanted out.
"The crew were almost complaining about being put in a general ward.
'We're OK, we just want to go home," a correspondent for Rossiya television reported in a newscast.
The men, trapped 600 feet under the Bering Sea, were rescued Sunday after a remote controlled British "Scorpio" underwater craft cut through cables and fishing nets that had ensnared their mini sub since Thursday.
They had an estimated six to 12 hours of air remaining when they finally surfaced.
They also had been running short of water, the men said Monday in comments on Rossiya and NTV television.
"We weren't out of water, we just didn't have enough of it," said crew member Alexander Uybin.
"We were short of oxygen, too.
Not badly, but we could feel in our bodies that we weren't getting enough."
Uybin said his first wish when the mini sub surfaced was "to take a breath of fresh air."
A reporter asked what they had most wanted when they reached a rescue ship.
One of the men called out, "To eat."
"Yes, to eat!"
Uybin agreed.
Gennady Bolonin, a representative of the company that made the 43 foot AS 28 mini submarine, said the men had simply tried to be patient.
"We realized we were on the bottom and reported it," he said.
"All we could do was wait for whatever decisions were taken.
After we'd said we were stuck, we just lay down and waited."
Temperatures in the craft reportedly were about 40 degrees Fahrenheit, and the men tried to share their body heat during the ordeal.
"We put on (thermal) diving overalls, and when you are keeping very close together, you get warm," Bolonin said.
Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov told reporters that Russia has robotic vehicles similar to the British Scorpio, but it would have taken longer to bring them to the scene.
"Our mini subs even eclipse Scorpios in some specifications, but trail them in mobility," Ivanov said at a news conference in Vilyuchinsk, in the Kamchatka region.
"Air lifting of our deep water robots to Kamchatka would have taken much more time."
Ivanov said a special commission already had been appointed to analyze actions by the Pacific Fleet and the Defense Ministry, and added that those involved would undergo a thorough debriefing.
There has been criticism that the Russian navy initially tried to keep the accident secret, and reports that news of it leaked out, triggering foreign help, only when word was spread by relatives of the trapped men.
"The main thing is that the people are alive," Ivanov said at the news conference.
"They are alive thanks to their personal stamina and bravery, as well as thanks to efforts of Russian and foreign rescuers who jointly carried out a unique operation."
NTV television reported that the cost of the rescue for the Russians alone was estimated by navy headquarters at about $1.5 million.
Foreign partners had not made any requests for reimbursement, it said.
Russian prosecutors have opened a criminal case against a naval captain accused of negligence in the efforts to rescue a mini submarine stranded off the country's Pacific coast earlier this month, officials said Monday.
The Pacific Fleet's deputy military prosecutor, Roman Kolbanov, said the officer had damaged an underwater remote controlled vehicle through lack of professionalism.
The officer was not identified by name.
The Venom vehicle was similar to the Scorpio submersible flown in by Britain to help free the mini submarine, which was trapped with seven men aboard deep in the Pacific Ocean.
The Venom's breakdown meant that the rescue operation cost an additional 10 million rubles (US$353000, euro285000), the prosecutor said.
Russia's naval chief of staff Adm. Vladimir Masorin said Friday that the Russian rescue team tried to deploy the Venom at the accident site, "but when they started to use it, they used it incorrectly it was spoiled by our people."
Masorin also said the navy would buy a US$3 million (euro2.5 million) Panther, which he described as a more modern device than the Scorpio.
The Scorpio provided by Britain succeeded in cutting through cables that had trapped the mini sub near the ocean floor.
Although the seven survived the three day ordeal, the accident and Russia's appeal for outside help underlined the navy's insufficient rescue capabilities.
Deployment of the British underwater vehicle used in this week's rescue of a trapped Russian submarine was delayed for hours because Russia did not have the right equipment to unload it from a cargo plane, Britain's military attache said Thursday.
The remote controlled vehicle was flown at Russia's request from Britain to help free the AS 28 mini submarine that was snared in cables 190 meters (600 feet) underwater off Russia's far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula.
Royal Navy Capt. Jonathan Holloway said British officials had warned Russians that a truck with an adjustable bed would be needed to get the vehicle off the C 17 cargo plane.
"We thought about it, and we said that we would need one," Holloway told The Associated Press.
"Of course, we couldn't wait to get the confirmation, because speed was so important."
But when the C 17 arrived near the city of Petropavlovsk Kamchatasky some 12 time zones away such a truck was not available and Russians only had a forklift a crude vehicle that was unable to unload the delicate Scorpio.
The problem was solved when an American C 5 military cargo plane arrived at the airport with more rescue equipment two hours later.
The American plane carried its own loader of the kind that was needed, and its crew lent it to the British team.
"All's well that ends well," said Holloway, who helped coordinate between the British rescue team and Russian officials.
Despite the delay, Holloway praised Russian officials for their assistance and cooperation, saying that the seven man crew of the AS 28 mini submarine was saved thanks to quick decision making and well coordinated efforts from everyone involved.
Russia's quick decision to seek foreign aid was in sharp contrast to the sinking of the Kursk nuclear submarine in August 2000, when authorities held off asking for outside assistance until hope was nearly exhausted, all 118 crew died.
Speaking at a news conference, Holloway also hailed the Russian navy for quickly providing precise information on position and condition of the mini sub that was initially trapped on a fishing net and then was entangled around an underwater surveillance antenna.
Russian officials first didn't mention the antenna, but then released the information after their own attempts to snag hold of the submarine and drag it to shallower water failed.
Some Russian media said that the rescue operation could have allowed British and U.S. rescue team a glimpse at the tightly protected naval surveillance system intended to track down foreign submarines.
Holloway said he did not believe that Russians exposed any of their secrets, saying that the British rescue team could see little detail and that it handed over the tape filmed by the Scorpio's camera.
He said that Russian officials told him that only six hours of oxygen remained on the mini sub at the moment it was rescued on Sunday afternoon, local time, after three days underwater.
Russian officials said later that much more oxygen remained on the ship, which Holloway said was plausible.
Air Cmdr. Wilson Metcalfe, a British defense and air attache, said that Britain would not charge Russia any money for the operation.
"When it's an international rescue operation, the country offering the help pays," Metcalfe told a news conference.
Rescue crews on Sunday lowered a British remote controlled underwater vehicle to a Russian mini submarine trapped deep under the Pacific Ocean, hoping to free the vessel and its seven trapped crewmen before their air supply ran out.
British crews, who arrived some hours earlier at the remote Kamchatka Peninsula, were working with Russian naval authorities to maneuver the Super Scorpio unmanned robotic vehicle and untangle the AS 28, which was caught up by a military listening antenna 190 meters (625 feet) below the surface nearly three days ago.
Capt. Igor Dygalo told The Associated Press that workers lowered the Super Scorpio at around 11:30 a.m. local time (2230 GMT) at the site in Beryozovaya Bay about 15 kilometers (10 miles) off the east coast of the peninsula, north of Japan.
The Super Scorpio then began cutting cables that had tangled the sub, Russian news agencies reported.
Earlier, Russian rescuers looped cables under the antenna and were hoping to bring both it and the 44 foot(13.2 meter) long sub closer to the surface, where divers could reach the crew.
Russian authorities hope British and American unmanned submersibles, sent after a Russian plea for help, can cut the submarine loose.
They are trying desperately to avoid losing a sub crew as they did with the Kursk nuclear submarine, which sank almost exactly five years ago, killing all 118 aboard.
A U.S. crew with two other Super Scorpio vehicles, meanwhile, was also making its way to the site after landing later on the rain soaked peninsula.
As the American submersibles and crews were being loaded onto ships near the port of Petropavlovsky Kamchatsky, Cmdr. Bill Hamblet, an assistant U.S. naval attache helping the operation, said the three countries were cooperating together with their best equipment and teams.
"It's hard to do anything at that depth, but everyone will try and do their best to save the crew," he told AP.
"Together the three countries will pull this off."
Navy estimates of how long the air would last ranged from the end of Saturday until Monday.
The Russian navy made contact with the crew late Saturday, and Pacific Fleet commander Adm. Viktor Fyodorov said their condition was "satisfactory" despite temperatures of 5 7 degrees Celsius (41 45 degrees Fahrenheit).
"They're not giving up hope," Fyodorov said in televised comments.
"I assure you, work is continuing without interruption through night and day and will not stop until we actually lift our guys up to the surface," he said.
It wasn't clear if contact with the crew was made by radio or through some other means, but officials said it was taking place every few hours.
Russia's plea for international assistance underlined the deficiencies of its once mighty navy and strongly contrasted with the August 2000 sinking of the Kursk, when authorities held off asking for help until hope was nearly exhausted.
Some of the 118 crew survived for many hours as breathable air ran out.
Rear Adm. Vladimir Pepelyayev, deputy head of the navy's general staff, said the air would likely last to the end of the day and possibly through Sunday.
Fyodorov gave a similar estimate, but later was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying there was enough to last until Monday.
"They have the air.
But you can imagine their state of mind after two days," Pepelyayev said.
Officials said the Russian submarine was participating in a combat training exercise and got snarled on an underwater antenna assembly that is part of a coastal monitoring system.
The system is anchored with a weight of about 60 metric tons (66 short tons), according to news reports.
Russia's cash strapped navy apparently lacks rescue vehicles capable of operating at the depth where the sub is stranded, and officials say it is too deep for divers or for the crew to swim out on their own.
An earlier attempt to drag the vessel to shallower waters failed when cables detached after pulling it some 60 meters (65 yards).
"We won't try to drag it anymore, we will try to lift the whole system, rip it off and bring it to the surface," Fyodorov said.
He said rescuers would try to raise the vessel by lifting with enough force to pull two heavy concrete anchors from the sea floor.
The new crisis indicated that promises by President Vladimir Putin to improve the navy's equipment apparently have had little effect.
He was sharply criticized for his slow response to the Kursk crisis and reluctance to accept foreign assistance.
By early Sunday, Putin had made no public comment on the latest sinking, but Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov flew to Kamchatka and was traveling to the site of the rescue operation.
At Moscow's request, Japan has dispatched four naval vessels to help rescue a Russian submarine snagged on the floor of the Pacific Ocean, but the ships aren't expected to arrive at the scene until early next week.
The ships include one submarine tender and three minesweepers, Marine Self Defense Force spokesman Hidetsubu Iwamasa said.
The submarine tender, which is equipped with rescue gear, left from Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo and is expected to rendezvous with the other ships at the site off Russia's Pacific coast on Monday or Tuesday, he said.
Russia asked for the assistance Friday, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said separately on condition of anonymity.
The Russian submarine had been tending an underwater antenna mounted to the sea floor when it became snagged on a wire helping to stabilize a ventilation cable attached to the antenna, the official said.
Russian navy officials said the mini submarine, trapped at a depth of 190 meters (625 feet), had seven sailors aboard, and it was unclear how long their oxygen supply would last.
Navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo said the U.S. Navy has also been asked for assistance, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.
Interfax said Russia's Pacific Fleet commander was in talks with top U.S. Navy officers over how the United States might help.
In televised comments, Pacific Fleet spokesman Capt. Alexander Kosolapov said there was contact with the sailors, who were not hurt, and that authorities were preparing to send down a similar vessel to assess the situation.
Rescue of a submarine stuck on the seabed off Russia's east coast is complicated because it is snagged in an underwater surveillance antenna system as well as snared in a fishing net, a senior Russian naval officer said Friday.
A remote controlled device was lowered to the stricken vessel "to cut the flexible tubes and cables of the coastal surveillance antenna in which the AS 28 vehicle is caught," Rear Admiral Vladimir Pepelayev was quoted by RIA Novosti news agency as saying.
The commander of Russia's Pacific Fleet, Admiral Viktor Fyodorov, separately told the NTV television network that rescuers "succeeded in moving one kilometer the entire system that the submarine is trapped in, including the system's anchor."
He did not provide further details on the "system" he was referring to, but said all of it, including the submarine, were being towed to shallower waters, a process he said could take a number of hours.
Pepelayev made no mention of movement of the "system," but said either rescuers would manage to cut the submarine free from it or a tug boat would pull the 60 ton anchor of the system out of the seabed, enabling rescuers to refloat the submarine.
There are seven crew members aboard the vessel, stranded on the ocean floor at a depth of around 190 meters (623 feet) in a bay off the coast of the Kamchatka peninsula in Russia's Far East region.
There were widely varying accounts of how much oxygen was remaining for the crew, but Fyodorov and other officials said they had reserves sufficient to last at least another day.
Britain's Royal Navy is to join efforts to free the crew of a Russian mini submarine trapped on the ocean floor, sending a remote control submersible to the scene, officials in London said Friday.
The underwater vehicle is equipped with cameras and an arm to help free the submarine, which is trapped after part of a fishing net became entangled in its propeller.
"It will be able to hopefully free the men," a Ministry of Defence spokesman said.
A Royal Air Force C 17 transport plane was due to fly to Glasgow to collect the remote control device, and would arrive in Russia on Saturday, the spokesman said.
The submersible would then be taken to the accident scene on the Kamchatka peninsula in the country's far east.
Earlier Friday, the US navy's Pacific Fleet said it was airlifting two remotely operated submersible vehicles to the site to help with rescue efforts, while Japan has also dispatched four military ships.
Seven Russian sailors are thought to be on the mini submarine, designed for use in rescue, research and intelligence gathering missions.
According to the Russian navy, the submarine only has 24 hours of oxygen left.
A top Russian naval commander said Friday that a tugboat had attached tow cables to a Russian mini submarine trapped on the seabed off Russia's Pacific coast, but he and other officials afterwards backed away from that assertion and said they were still checking.
The effort to attach the cables marked the start of an operation to raise the vessel trapped 190 metres (623 feet) below the surface with seven crewmen on board, Admiral Viktor Fyodorov, commander of Russia's Pacific fleet, told Russian media.
He said cables had successfully been attached to the stricken vessel and efforts were under way to begin towing it to shallow water.
He was subsequently quoted by Interfax news agency as saying that attachment of the cables to the mini submarine was not certain and that a video camera was being lowered to find out what the cables were attached to.
"Then we can tell 100 percent that it's the submarine.
And only then can we say that we carried out our task," Fyodorov said.
The plan, he said, was to attach the cables to the submarine and tow it 15 kilometres (nine miles) from the point where it became trapped, Fyodorov said.
The submarine, used in rescue, research and intelligence gathering missions, became stuck at the bottom of the Bay of Berezovaya off Russia's Far East coast when its propeller was caught in a fishing net on Thursday.
Fyodorov said earlier that the seven crewmen were in satisfactory condition and had been instructed to remain horizontal in order to preserve their strength and reduce their consumption of oxygen.
Britain, Japan and the United States were all due to provide assistance in the rescue operation.
The incident is a chilling reminder of the sinking of the Kursk nuclear submarine in August 2000 that killed all 118 crew members following an emergency response effort widely criticised as sluggish.
Japan on Friday dispatched four military ships to help Russia rescue seven crew members aboard a small submarine trapped on the seabed in the Far East, officials said.
But the ships, which have 370 Japanese military personnel on board, are likely to need until early Monday to reach the stranded submarine, a Defense Agency spokesman said.
The Russian Pacific Fleet said the crew had 120 hours of oxygen reserves on board when the submarine submerged at midday Thursday (2300 GMT Wednesday) off the Kamchatka peninsula, the stretch of Far Eastern Russia facing the Bering Sea.
Japan dispatched a submarine rescue vessel, the Chiyoda, and a depot ship from Yokosuka port near Tokyo and two minesweepers from the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, the defense spokesman said.
"We will do our utmost efforts to rescue them.
We are hopeful," he said.
The assistance comes despite rocky relations between Japan and Russia, which have yet to formally end World War II amid Japan's claims to four islands off Hokkaido that Soviet troops seized in August 1945.
"We received a request from Russia and the dispatch was decided accordingly," said a foreign ministry official who deals with Russian affairs.
Russia's Interfax AVN military news agency said the Russians hoped the stranded mini submarine would be raised to the surface before the Japanese ships arrive.
"We hope the assistance from our Japanese colleagues will not be necessary," Admiral Viktor Dmitriyev, commander of the Russian Pacific Fleet, was quoted by the agency as saying.
The mini submarine, designed for research, rescue and intelligence operations, was resting on the seabed at a depth of about 200 meters (656 feet).
Specialists said it could have become tangled up with a metal cable or in sunken nets from a fishing trawler, according to Russian news reports.
The small submarine was in the Bay of Berezovaya about 75 kilometres (46 miles) from the coastal town of Petropavlovsk Kamchatskiy on the Kamchatka peninsula.
A Russian mini submarine that was trapped for nearly three days under the Pacific Ocean surfaced Sunday with all seven people aboard alive after a British remote controlled vehicle cut away the undersea cables that had snarled it.
All seven aboard the AS 28 mini submarine appeared to be in satisfactory condition, naval spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo said.
They were examined in the clinic of a naval ship, then transferred to a larger vessel to return to the mainland.
"The crew opened the hatch themselves, exited the vessel and climbed aboard a speedboat," Rear Adm. Vladimir Pepelyayev, deputy head of the naval general staff, told reporters.
"Preliminary indications are that their condition is satisfactory."
"I can only thank our English colleagues for their joint wok and the help they gave in order to complete this operation within the time we had available that is, before the oxygen reserves ran out," he said.
The sub surfaced at around 4:26 p.m. local time (0126 GMT), some three days after becoming stranded in 190 meters (600 feet) of water off the Pacific Coast on Thursday.
It was carrying six sailors and a representative of the company that manufactured it.
Earlier, a British remote controlled Super Scorpio cut away the cables that had snarled the 44 foot (13.2 meter) mini submarine in Beryozovaya Bay, about 15 kilometers (10 miles) off the east coast of the Kamchatka peninsula.
The British vehicle was sent after the navy appealed for international help a sharp contrast to the sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk in August 2000, when authorities held off asking for outside assistance for days.
All 118 aboard the Kursk died.
The United States also dispatched a crew and three underwater vehicles to Kamchatka at Russia's request, but they were not deployed at the accident site.
In an echo of the Kursk sinking, President Vladimir Putin had made no public comment by Sunday on the mini sub drama.
Putin in remaining on vacation as the Kursk disaster unfolded, raising criticism that he appeared either callous or ineffectual.
Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov traveled to Kamchatka on Saturday.
Officials said the mini submarine was participating in a combat training exercise and got snarled on an underwater antenna assembly that is part of a coastal monitoring system.
The system was anchored with a weight of about 60 metric tons (66 short tons), according to news reports.
Russia's cash strapped navy apparently lacks rescue vehicles capable of operating at the depth where the sub was stranded, and officials say it was too deep for divers to reach or the crew to swim out on their own.
An earlier attempt to drag the vessel to shallower waters failed when cables detached after pulling it some 60 meters (65 yards).
The new crisis indicated that promises by Putin to improve the navy's equipment apparently have had little effect.
He was sharply criticized for his slow response to the Kursk crisis and reluctance to accept foreign assistance.
A small Russian submarine was freed on Sunday from its undersea entanglement of the Far East coast by an unmanned British rescue vehicle that cut away the nets that ensnared it.
All seven crew members were alive and rushed aboard a Russian surface vessel, where they were being examined by a medical team, Russian news agencies and the U.S. Navy said.
The vessel rose to the surface at 4:26 p.m. local time, ending the crew's ordeal in the cold and darkness more than 600 feet below the surface off the Kamchatka Peninsula.
There remained uncertainties about how the submersible, a 44 foot rescue vessel, became disabled, and exactly what immobilized it.
Throughout the rescue operation, Russian officers spoke of cables and hoses that held the craft fast, while Western naval officials said fishing nets had trapped the craft.
The disentanglement and ascent of the small submarine, trapped since Thurssday, was an utterly different outcome from Russia's last prominent submarine crisis, in 2000, when the nuclear submarine Kursk sank after on board explosions in shallow water in the Barents Sea.
Russia resisted international assistance in that crisis, and made a series of false statements about its problems at sea.
As the British sailors worked, Russian officials said the submarine's crew of seven men were alive and had donned thermal suits, huddled together in a single compartment and were minimizing their movements to conserve their remaining air.
Power had been all but shut down inside the sunken vessel and its heater turned off to save its dwindling energy reserves, rendering the titanium hulled craft a chilled, dark tube.
The British reached the scene first in part because they had a shorter flight to get their Scorpio to Russia.
But it also took Americans four hours longer than expected Friday to load the Scorpios onto a cargo plane in San Diego, with both the Air Force and the Navy citing each other for contributing to some of the delay.
Still, American officials said the rescue was a testament to the intense efforts that have been made to increase cooperation among navies since the Kursk sunk.
"The close team work and global coordination between our navies to rescue these sailors in such a short time is testimony to the spirit and determination of our nations," said Adm. Gary Roughead, commander of the US Pacific Fleet.
The Russian navy worked desperately on Friday to save a small military submarine that had sunk to the seafloor off Russia's Pacific coast, and called for international help to rescue the crew.
The seven men on board were said to have as little as 24 hours of air.
The submarine, a 44 foot long vessel known as a Priz that was itself designed for undersea rescue operations, became imperiled Thursday, the Russian Navy said, after its propeller became entangled in an undersea object during an exercise.
It sank to the bottom in more than 600 feet of water off the Kamchatka Peninsula in Beryozovaya Bay.
Although the initial reports indicated that the submarine was tangled in a fishing net, late Friday here the Russian navy said it might have become stuck against an undersea piece of military equipment that it was inspecting.
The navy said throughout Friday that it was in contact with the trapped crew members, who were in good health, and that it was sweeping the area with the anchors of two surface vessels, trying either to snag the submarine or to sever the debris that had crippled it.
Late Friday, the navy said one of the vessels had snagged the submarine and was trying to tow it to shallower waters, where divers might reach it and determine what might be done next.
Adm. Viktor D. Fyodorov, commander of Russia's Pacific Fleet, announced on the NTV television station that the vessel had managed to drag the Priz 1 kilometer, or six tenths of a mile, along the sea floor.
He hoped the submarine would be in a better position for a rescue attempt within eight hours, which would be noon Saturday in Russia's Far East.
"The crew members are alive and confirm that they are watching the work of our rescue forces," he said.
"We continue the work of rescuing our comrades."
The situation was grave.
The vessel remained at a depth out of reach of divers, and far too deep for the crew to try to escape independently.
The navy also seemed unsure of the extent of the remaining air supply, with senior naval officers and spokesmen releasing estimates to Russian news agencies that ranged from 24 hours to several days.
The Russian military was racing against time early Friday to rescue a small submarine that had become trapped on the seabed with seven crew aboard, the Ria Novosti news agency reported.
The bathyscaphe submersible had only 24 hours of oxygen in reserve when it became stuck late Thursday at a depth of 190 metres (623 feet) in the bay of Kamchatka in far eastern Russia, a military source told the agency.
The source, who did not want to be identified, said the mini submarine had become attached to an as yet unidentified object during a routine exercise in the Bay of Berezovaya, about 75 kilometres (46 miles) from the town of Petropavlovsk Kamchatskyi.
Specialists said it could have become tangled up with a metal cable or a sunken trawler, the report said.
A spokesman for the Pacific fleet said the crew's condition was "normal".
The military prosecutor has opened an inquiry.
One leading candidate has been debilitated by what he said was an attempt to poison him.
A thrown egg did more than smear the coat of another.
A mysteriously rescheduled military parade has fueled rumors of plans for a state of emergency.
Attack ads have explored the depths of what is known here as "black propaganda."
"It's like 'The Matrix,"' said Andrei Gurin, who was not the only voter here to describe Ukraine's presidential campaign as something close to cinematic.
"Nothing to trust, nothing to believe."
President Leonid D. Kuchma's decision not to seek a third five year term after maneuvering to change the constitution to allow it has opened a fierce and increasingly nasty presidential campaign.
The leading candidates are offering starkly different visions, especially in foreign relations.
With election day less than a month away, on Oct 31, polls suggest a tight race between the most prominent of two dozen candidates: Viktor A. Yushchenko, a former prime minister and central banker and now the leader of the anti Kuchma opposition, and Viktor F. Yanukovich, the current prime minister, who promises to carry out much of Kuchma's legacy.
Neither front runner is expected to win an outright majority.
A runoff is scheduled for Nov 21.
The race is one of the most competitive in a former Soviet state, and its outcome could significantly alter the course of this country with 47 million people at an important crossroads of Europe.
Yushchenko, who appears to hold a slight lead in the polls, has long been pro Western and encouraging free market reforms.
He has promised to steer Ukraine toward a more open and democratic society, ending what he calls the cronyism and corruption of Kuchma's 10 years in power.
Yushchenko has vowed to improve economic and political relations with the European Union and NATO, while withdrawing Ukraine's 1600 troops from Iraq.
Like many here, he argues that Kuchma dispatched the force largely to improve tattered ties with the Bush administration.
Yanukovich's economic and social pledges echo his opponent's, but in his view Ukraine's future depends on closer relations with Russia, the country's largest trading partner.
He remains more reserved about Europe and the United States, but has said he would not withdraw Ukrainian troops from Iraq until democratic elections are held there.
"Whoever is the victor, the direction will be clear," said Yuliya V. Tymoshenko, a supporter of Yushchenko's who has criticized Kuchma's alternating efforts to improve relations with the West and then with Russia.
"At least a choice will be made.
We are tired of the president and his team pulling the compass of foreign policy everywhere."
Each candidate's campaign has used foreign policy to attack the other.
Posters found in a warehouse and confiscated by Yushchenko's supporters last week depicted the candidate as a tool of the United States.
One showed President Bush riding Ukraine like a horse under Yushchenko's campaign logo.
Yushchenko's supporters in turn deride Yanukovich, accusing him of seeking to appease Russia.
Yanukovich gave his opponents ammunition with a trip to Moscow that included a meeting on Saturday with President Vladimir V. Putin, who all but endorsed his candidacy.
Whether the candidates' competing visions decide the vote remains very much an open question, largely because they have been overshadowed by the strange twists of the campaign.
Yushchenko has spent much of the last month in a hospital in Austria, after falling ill on Sept 6 from what he and his supporters called an attempt to poison him.
After returning to Kiev to resume campaigning on Sept 18, he accused Kuchma's government of an assassination attempt.
"You will not poison us," Yushchenko said to the government at a large rally of supporters in Kiev that day.
"You do not have enough bullets and trucks to break us."
On Sept 30, however, Yushchenko returned to Austria for treatment of his ailments, including paralysis in the left side of his face.
"The illness is much worse than we thought," said Oleksandr O. Zinchenko, a member of the national legislature and chairman of Yushchenko's campaign, speaking in an interview.
Yushchenko only returned to Ukraine on Sunday night, appearing wan and visibly weakened, in Lviv, the western city where his support is deepest, according to televised reports.
On Monday, he returned to the campaign trail in Kiev.
"I am alive, I am OK, and I am back," Yushchenko told a large crowd of supporters.
In his absence, surrogates have stumped on Yushchenko's behalf, even as the legislature, controlled by a coalition opposed to Kuchma, authorized an investigation into his accusations.
The hospital in Vienna, Rudolfinerhaus, first issued a statement discounting the possibility of poisoning, only to retract it, saying it was impossible to rule it out.
Then the chairman of the legislature's investigation committee, Volodimir Sivkovich, stunned Yushchenko's supporters by declaring before the legislature that there was no evidence to suggest an assassination attempt, although he did not rule out that Yushchenko might have been poisoned.
He said in an interview that "neither Yushchenko nor his headquarters had any legal right to say that someone made an attempt on his life."
"In our country there are a lot of lies, more than any other country in the world," Sivkovich said.
Yanukovich's supporters have leveled their own accusations of an attempted assassination.
On Sept 24, Yanukovich collapsed while campaigning in Ivano Frankivsk.
His aides said at the time that he was struck in the head by a blunt object and blamed supporters of Yushchenko.
A video, however, clearly shows that an egg struck him in the chest as he stepped off his campaign bus.
After two or three seconds, he clutched his chest and collapsed into the arms of his aides, who whisked him to a hospital, although he appeared to have been unhurt.
The attack, like all of Yanukovich's campaign events, received prominent attention on the country's television networks, all but one of which is owned or controlled by the government.
That has prompted accusations that the government is using all its resources to favor Yanukovich.
A parade to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Kiev's liberation from Nazi Germany on Nov 6, 1944, has been moved forward to Oct 28, three days before the election.
Opponents see that as an election ploy or, worse, evidence for a military crackdown.
Sergei L. Vasiliyev, chief spokesman for Kuchma's administration, insisted that the election would be free and fair.
"We do not have an experience with any other kind," he said, referring to the country's post Soviet presidential elections.
He said Yanukovich's dominance in news reports reflected his official duties as prime minister.
The egg attack appears to have engendered little sympathy, prompting ridicule and at least one pointed joke.
A grandmother goes to the market, the joke goes, and when finished with her shopping sees an official portrait of Yanukovich.
"Oy," she says, "I forgot to buy eggs."
Yanukovich's opponents have made accusations of serious violations of election laws, though, as have Ukrainian and international election observers.
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported recently that campaign events have been disrupted, while students and public employees have been pressured to support Yanukovich's candidacy.
Oleksandr O. Moroz, a member of the legislature and the perennial Socialist Party candidate for president, accused the government of "seriously preparing for falsifying the results" on Yanukovich's behalf.
He said Kuchma might even cancel the election outright, if Yanukovich risked losing.
Vasiliyev, the presidential spokesman, called that "complete nonsense."
Moroz, who trails distantly in the polls, said the circumstances surrounding the campaign has obscured the country's serious problems.
They include, he said in an interview in his office, social inequities, an economy controlled by a handful of tycoons close to the government, corruption and what he called "state criminality" under Kuchma.
He called the election an important choice for Ukraine.
"People," he said, "are tired of scandals."
Ukraine's pro Russian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich and his pro Western rival Viktor Yushchenko, who will face off in the second round of presidential elections this week, on Monday traded accusations of corruption and incompetence in their first and only televised debate.
During the live debate, Yanukovich slammed Yushchenko, reformist prime minister of the former Soviet republic in 1999 2001, for having closed down the Chernobyl power station, scene of the worst nuclear accident in history.
"You are not a patriot.
You made your country dependent when you signed Chernobyl's closure," said Yanukovich, who is widely popular in Ukraine's Russian speaking east and who has Moscow's backing.
"You and your team are bankrupt functionaries who got together to return to power.
For you, all power is criminal unless it is yours," he scoffed.
"The new leadership is already here, it will not leave and there is no way to expel it," he warned, also blaming Yushchenko for the widespread corruption in Ukrainian society.
Yushchenko in his turn condemned the "destructive economic policies" of the current authorities, which he claimed controlled "the shadow economy" and were to blame for widespread poverty and wage arrears.
He still bore marks from the mysterious poison related illness, which paralyzed and scarred part of his face and threatened to sideline him from the campaign.
On foreign policy, Yushchenko argued that Ukraine needed to keep up good ties with both its powerful neighbors, the European Union as well as Russia.
"We have strategic partners both in the east and the west, and it would do us no good to lose the Russian market but it would be wrong to turn away from the path into the European Union, which is also one of the most important markets," Yushchenko argued.
Yanukovich, by contrast, accuses the EU of "a double standard policy toward Ukraine" and champions an economic union with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.
Yushchenko, whose supporters are chiefly found in Ukraine's nationalist west, also accused the authorities of corruption and "acting on the principle of 'divide and rule',on issues such as our language and religion."
The run off vote on November 21 will decide whether or not Ukraine, with a population of 48 million people and a massive Soviet era military force, will move closer to Europe after decades of domination by Russia.
Yushchenko won 39.87 percent of the first round vote, held on October 31, against Yanukovich's 39.32 percent.
European and US officials strongly protested after Ukraines' state run television virtually denied all coverage to Yushchenko's campaign, focusing on heavily on Yanukovich decision to boost pensions weeks before the elections.
Ukraine opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko Wednesday proposed holding a new round of presidential elections to resolve a standoff over a disputed weekend vote, Interfax reported.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich said Tuesday that if his victory in a disputed presidential election is confirmed he would offer the post of prime minister to his rival, the pro Western opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko.
Ukrainian opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko on Wednesday refused to recognize the election of pro Moscow Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, calling the decision proclaiming his victory illegal.
"The illegal decision of the electoral commission has placed Ukraine on the verge of civil conflict," Yushchenko told tens of thousands of opposition supporters massed on Ukraine's central Independence Square.
Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko arrived at parliament Tuesday, demanding that deputies annul the results of a weekend election that handed victory to his pro Russian rival. ant sb/hm/jz Ukraine vote parliament
Ukraine's opposition deputies on Tuesday proclaimed Viktor Yushchenko the winner of the weekend's disputed presidential runoff in an emergency parliament meeting that failed to reach quorum.
"Today we are proclaimed Viktor Yushchenko the president of Ukraine, and he will assume his functions starting today," opposition deputy Yulia Timoshenko said.
The meeting was attended by 191 of the Rada's 450 deputies.
The session was boycotted by the pro government majority that supports pro Moscow Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, who is leading the official count from Sunday's vote.
DONETSK, Ukraine, Oct 30 In Donetsk, part of the Russian speaking Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, they have no doubt about the outcome of this Sunday's presidential election: Viktor Yanukovich, prime minister and the candidate backed by outgoing president Leonid Kuchma, will be elected in a local landslide.
They are fairly confident, too, in Khoruzhivka, a village of 1500 people in the northeast of the country.
Their favourite son, Viktor Yuschchenko, pro western candidate of the opposition, will be the next president of Ukraine's 50 million people, in spite of a systematic campaign against him.
Two Viktors, two candidates, two constituencies.
But in Donetsk there is little evidence that there is any race at all.
Supporters of Yushchenko tried to put up marquees to distribute publcity for their candidate but the main square is the only place one can be found.
"The town hall decided our tents were 'an architectural form' and so we had to get permission from several municipal services and the environmental inspectors to put them up," said Maria Olyinik, head of the Yushchenko team in Donetsk.
Lawyers for the campaign have spent days arguing their case: meanwhile opposition offices are vandalised and the police refuse to take action.
A critical regional weekly has been closed down and its staff evicted from their offices.
Olyinik admits that Yushchenko will not do very well in this region: 10 percent to 12 percent if the election is fair, zero percent to five percent if its is rigged, she says.
In Khoruzhivka, 300 kilometres (180 miles) to the north, Yuschchenko's home town, they miss Channel 5, the only opposition television station, which is no longer broadcast in this part of Ukraine.
Visiting the capital Kiev to demonstrate for Yushchenko had to be a night time expedition, locals say, because police blocked the roads during the day.
But the village's walls are plastered with pictures of Yushchenko kissing one of his five children and the village school boasts a computer suite financed by the local boy made good.
Here they have no doubt that a mysterious illness that struck Yushchenko recently and has left traces on his face was an attempt to poison him.
Although a native of the northeast Yuschcenko draws much of his support from the more western orientated Ukrainian speaking south and west of the country.
"He is an honest man: I always cry when I listen to the lies they tell about him on the television," said one elderly lady.
And there are fears that the election of Yanukovich. overtly backed by Russian President Vladmir Putin, could herald a new era of repression.
One local man says the village has been told it will be punished if Yanukovich collects less than 34 percent of the vote locally.
In Donetsk they are confident that Yanukovich will win 90 percent local backing, not least because he has recently doubled pensions.
The only protests have come from four retired people who turned up at local government offices to call for an honest election and to protest against rising prices.
Ukraine's pro Western opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko on Tuesday rejected an offer by his rival for the presidency to appoint him prime minister or for both men to withdraw from new elections.
"No, I cannot accept these proposals," Yushchenko told reporters.
Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko has a good chance of making a full recovery from an illness that has prompted charges of poisoning and ravaged his appearance, a Viennese doctor supervising the case said Wednesday.
"If nothing hits him again, or nothing else has appeared in the meanwhile, I guess he has a fair and great likelihood of making a full recovery," Dr Michael Zimpfer, the president of Vienna's Rudolfinerhaus Hospital where Yushchenko was treated, told AFP.
Zimpfer said Yushchenko, whose skin has been discoloured and pockmarked by the illness, was also likely to regain the good looks for which he is noted.
"It should be reversible.
I have told him that the skin takes a much longer period of recovery than the rest," said the doctor, adding the 50 year old politician had been "a pretty healthy individual beforehand."
"There was no underlying illness of the liver or pancreas that suddenly broke out," he said.
West leaning Yushchenko, who Wednesday called for a fresh vote as official results showed Moscow backed Viktor Yanukovich had defeated him in Sunday's presidential election, was admitted to the private Austrian hospital in September suffering from a severe gastro intestinal illness.
His camp immediately said it was the result of a poisoning attempt by political rivals at a time when he had a strong lead over Yanukovich.
Press reports noted that Yushchenko fell ill after a meeting with the former head of the KGB the Soviet agency which used drugs against political foes and foreign spies.
Zimpfer said the hospital had found no evidence of poisoning and neither had a medical insitute in the United States to which they referred the case within days.
"They are examining blood and other samples.
They are still considering the theory of poisoning, but also finding difficulty in proving it," he said, declining to name the US hospital as he had not asked their permission.
Zimpfer said he regularly spoke to Yushchenko's family and his doctors in Ukraine and therefore knew his symptoms but still had no idea as to what caused them.
"I am privileged that they consult me for a second opinion.
I know all the symptoms, but I do not know the cause that kicked it off."
If there had been an attempt to poison the politician it would likely have been done in a manner designed to look like an accident and leave no forensic trace.
"We are completely convinced that it was not housewife's poison.
We would find that just by walking past him.
The Ukrainian prosecutor general's office announced Sunday it had reopened an investigation into allegations that presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned, after doctors in Austria confirmed he had ingested dioxin.
Returning to Kiev after checking out of a clinic in Vienna, Austria, Yushchenko said he was sure that authorities were responsible for the dioxin poisoning that had disfigured his face and caused other symptoms.
"I am convinced that this is the work of the authorities, absolutely convinced," Yushchenko told reporters at Kiev airport.
The pro Western reformer is engaged in a bitter presidential contest with Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and has alleged since suddenly falling ill in September that he was poisoned in an assassination attempt.
Authorities have denied the charge, and some pro government politicians have ridiculed it.
Yushchenko fell sick Sept 6, a day after having late night food and drinks with Ihor Smeshko, the head of the Security Service of Ukraine, and others.
The prosecutor general's office dropped its initial investigation of the allegation in late October.
Serhiy Rudenko, a spokesman, said then that no poisoning agents had been found in forensic medical tests and that there was no data to prove deliberate poisoning or the use of biological weapons against Yushchenko.
Speaking to reporters Sunday at the private Rudolfinerhaus clinic in Vienna, where doctors announced Saturday that they had confirmed dioxin poisoning, Yushchenko said a full scale investigation should wait until after Dec 26, when he faces Yanukovych in a repeat election.
The Supreme Court set the revote after ruling that the Nov 21 balloting, narrowly won by Yanukovych according to the official count, was invalid due to fraud.
"I don't want this factor to influence the election in some way either as a plus or a minus," Yushchenko said.
"This question will require a great deal of time and serious investigation.
Let us do it after the election.
Today is not the moment."
Yushchenko said massive street protests in central Kiev's Independence Square, which helped prompt parliament to enact electoral reforms aimed at preventing fraud in the revote, had brought historic change to Ukraine.
"I think that the heart of Ukraine moved to Independence Square in Kiev over the last three weeks, and old people, young people, everyone, were defending not Yushchenko but they were defending their choice for the type of Ukraine they want to see in the future," he said, as his U.S. born wife, Kateryna Chumachenko, translated.
"We hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years," Yuschenko said.
"I think it would be appropriate to compare this to the fall of the Soviet Union or the fall of the Berlin Wall,Over the last three weeks, you have seen a different country, a different nation.
The regime that was in place for 14 years in Ukraine is now living its last days."
Michael Zimpfer, the clinic's director, thanked doctors from around the world who had helped "to clarify the difficult Yushchenko illness that has not been observed anywhere else beforehand."
While dioxin poisoning is not medically unknown, it typically occurs through environmental exposure, when it is inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
Doctors said Saturday that damage to Yushchenko's digestive system suggested the poison had been ingested.
"It would have been easy to put it in a cream soup," Zimpfer said Saturday.
At Kiev airport, Yushchenko said it should not take too long to reach a conclusion in the attempted murder case.
"A lot of the circumstances are already known," he said.
"I think if the general prosecutor acts according to Ukraine's laws, both the country and the world at large will soon know who did this."
Sonya Yee of the Times' Vienna bureau contributed to this report.
New tests conducted Friday night at a hospital in Vienna, Austria, confirmed that Viktor A. Yushchenko, the Ukrainian opposition candidate for president, had been poisoned with dioxin, providing an explanation for a broad array of painful and disfiguring conditions that plagued him during the past three months of the campaign.
There was "no doubt" that Yushchenko's disease "has been caused by a case of poisoning by dioxin," Dr Michael Zimpfer, president of the Rudolfinerhaus Hospital said at a news conference on Saturday.
"We have proved the source of his problem, and we clearly suspect third party involvement," Zimpfer said in a subsequent interview.
But he said law enforcement authorities would have to determine how the poisoning occurred.
Yushchenko and his aides had long insisted that he had been poisoned, a charge that his opponents ridiculed, saying that the once telegenic candidate had been stricken by bad sushi or too much drink.
On Friday, Yushchenko said: "It is my growing conviction that what happened to me was an act of political reprisal against a politician in opposition.
The aim, naturally, was to kill me."
Zimpfer, who has been part of Yushchenko's medical team since he was first rushed to Rudolfinerhaus in early September, said that Yushchenko's blood dioxin level was "more than 1000 times" the upper limits of normal and that his initial severe abdominal pain suggested that he had eaten the poison.
Yushchenko has always been vague on the topic of who tried to poison him.
A spokeswoman for Yushchenko, Irina Gerashchenko, said in a telephone interview that the diagnosis compelled prosecutors to reopen a criminal investigation into his poisoning.
Dioxin, a waste product of various industrial chemical processes, is a highly toxic chemical that remains in the body for years after exposure, so doctors were able to test their patient Friday, long after the near fatal poisoning occurred.
Initially the poison often produces severe abdominal pains, nausea and vomiting and, in the long term, very high doses can produce the kind of skin cysts and discoloration that have disfigured Yushchenko.
Such cysts can persist for years after the initial dose, as do several other more subtle medical effects.
Dioxin causes a strong predisposition toward developing cancer later in life and can also affect the body's fat metabolism.
But none of that would affect Yushchenko's political aspirations today.
"If you survive the initial attempt, you can do all right," Zimpfer said.
"He is perfect condition, in perfect mental shape."
An extremely unusual cause of poisoning, dioxin exposure most often comes from industrial accidents where it is inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
Doctors in Vienna declined to speculate on exactly how Yushchenko was poisoned.
"We weren't there and we will have to leave that to the legal authorities to decide," he said.
Ukraine's defiant opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko says his family has gone into hiding for fear of their safety, the Sunday Telegraph reported.
"Even today, my family cannot live in Kiev," he told the newspaper in an interview as Ukraine looked forward to fresh elections on December 26 after days of mass street protests.
"My children can't go to school.
I believe the worst is behind us, but still it is not safe for my family.
It will not be safe before we have completed the political transformation of this country."
Yushchenko has both US and Ukrainian citizenship.
He and his wife have three children, and appeared together on stage at a demonstration Friday in the capital.
Speaking on Saturday in his dacha on the outskirts of Kiev, Yushchenko said he was determined to find out the facts behind a suspected attempt to poison him by supporters of outgoing president Leonid Kuchma.
His face remains disfigured as a result of a mystery illness which struck during the election campaign.
"Soon the world will know what happened," he said.
"I will reveal all the details of what they gave me to look like this."
Viktor A. Yushchenko, his face disfigured by poison and his fate nearly undone by electoral fraud, took the oath of office as president of Ukraine on Sunday, vowing to unite a poor and deeply divided country and lead it into the mainstream of Europe.
Speaking first in parliament and then in Kiev's central square, Yushchenko declared Ukraine's freedom and independence in thinly veiled remarks aimed at the outgoing president, Leonid D. Kuchma, and at Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, who openly supported Yushchenko's opponent.
"Armed only by their faith and beliefs, the people won a beautiful and peaceful victory," he told tens of thousands of Ukrainians waving flags and banners in Independence Square, the site of the demonstrations that helped usher him to office.
"It is a victory of freedom over tyranny, of law over lawlessness, of future over past."
Yushchenko's inauguration punctuated an extraordinary period in Ukraine's history that included two rounds of voting last fall, followed by huge street protests and a legal challenge that ultimately overturned the declared victory of his opponent, Viktor F. Yanukovych, and led to the third round of voting on Dec 26 in which Yushchenko triumphed.
In his speeches, Yushchenko, 50, was alternately conciliatory and defiant.
His, he said, was a victory for all Ukrainians, and he pledged to honor the people's right to worship in their own faith, to embrace their own politics and to speak in the language of their ancestors, the last was a reference to the divisive issue of the Russian language, which Yanukovych had promised to make equal in law to Ukrainian.
Ukrainian, proscribed by the Soviets, was made the country's official language after the country declared its independence in 1991.
Yushchenko also vowed to fight the corruption and the shadowy economy that had become characteristic of the tumultuous decade under Kuchma, where a few people closely allied with power accumulated vast fortunes.
"We shall create a democratic power honest, professional and patriotic," Yushchenko said.
"The wall that separates government from the people will be destroyed."
Yushchenko, a former central banker and prime minister under the man he ultimately replaced, became the third president of this country of 48 million people since it declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
He did so facing not only the usual challenges of a new leader, but also expectations intensified by the eruption of public discontent after efforts by Kuchma's government to install Yanukovych as Kuchma's chosen successor.
"The expectations are too great," Yulia Tishchenko, of the Ukrainian Center for Independent Political Research in Kiev, said in an interview before the inauguration, warning that the public's jubilation over Yushchenko's victory would soon confront the harsh reality of governance.
"Different segments of the population have different expectations.
And he will not be able, in a short period of time, to live up to them."
The country has been strained by stark divisions of wealth, by poverty and by unemployment, which has forced millions to seek work abroad.
Recent economic growth has slowed, while the federal budget has gone from a surplus to a deficit within months after a raft of campaign related expenditures on pensions and other social benefits under Yanukovych, who until Dec 31 was prime minister.
Yushchenko's aides and independent analysts also said that during the prolonged electoral dispute, the government continued to sell off state assets and provide long term leases on commercial buildings in Kiev and entire enterprises in other parts of the country.
"They are basically stealing stuff," said Roman M. Zvarich, a member of Yushchenko's coalition in parliament.
Above all, Ukraine remains politically divided.
In spite of Yushchenko's pleas for unity, Yanukovych did not attend the inauguration.
Kuchma, who did, did not answer Yushchenko's subsequent call for all in parliament to join him for his inaugural address on Independence Square.
Yushchenko also faces the difficulty of holding together the broad but fractious coalition that challenged the results of the first runoff.
He has yet to announce his appointments for prime minister and other posts in the new Cabinet, a delay that experts say has already delayed the momentum of his presidency in its infancy.
On Sunday, the acting prime minister, Mykola Y. Azarov, who took over when Yanukovych stepped aside, announced his resignation, as required by law.
But in Yushchenko's first act as president, he asked Azarov and the current government to continue working until he chose a new government.
"The choice was always between a consolidation of democracy or a consolidation of authoritarianism," Hryhoriy M. Nemyria, director of the European Center for International Studies in Kiev, said in an interview.
"The choice was made toward the consolidation of democracy, but it needs to be consolidated.
The revolution is only the beginning."
The inauguration was attended by the presidents of seven countries Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Estonia, Lativa and Molodova as well as by political leaders from many others.
For the United States, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell attended.
Russia sent Sergei M. Mironov, the speaker of the upper house of parliament.
As each of the leaders was announced in parliament, the loudest applause erupted for the leaders of countries who had over the decades risen up against Soviet domination: President Aleksandr Kwasniewski of Poland, Vaclav Havel, the former Czech president, and Nana Burdzhanadze, the speaker of Georgia's parliament.
Powell met with Yushchenko before the inauguration and, echoing a congratulatory telephone call from President Bush on Saturday, said the United States was prepared to help in the country's transition.
"The United States wants to do everything we can to help you meet the expectations of the Ukrainian people," Powell said, making an unexpected final overseas trip as secretary after a delay in the confirmation of Condoleezza Rice as his successor.
Yushchenko, after their meeting, responded with a list of requests, including recognition of Ukraine as a market economy, support for its membership in the World Trade Organization, and a lifting of sanctions imposed under the Jackson Vanik Amendment, a Cold War era law that limits trade because of Soviet restrictions on emigration.
Yushchenko later spoke of Sunday as a turning point in the country's history.
"Today's event has proven once more that the Ukrainian nation and the Ukrainian state have arrived," he said in parliament, after taking the oath of office with his arm draped over a 500 year old Bible and a copy of the constitution.
"Citizens of Ukraine have achieved a fair election.
A legitimate handover of power has taken place."
Yushchenko later vowed that he would lead Ukraine into its proper place in Europe and specifically in the European Union, which has only just absorbed many of Ukraine's Central and Eastern European neighbors and appears wary of inviting still another larger, developing nation.
"We are no longer on the edge of Europe," he said.
"We are situated in the center of Europe."
Throughout Kiev, the mood was ebullient.
Rivers of orange flags, banners, scarves and hats in the color of Yushchenko's campaign coursed through the streets.
For many in Independence Square, it was enough to witness Yushchenko's inauguration and his address, which ended with confetti and balloons rising into a cold, leaden sky and a concert of the songs that provided the revolution its overture.
"To tell you the truth, to the last day I did not think it would happen," said Vitaly K. Samusevych, a retired miner who had joined the thousands who went to the streets to protest the initial results that made Yanukovych the winner.
"When he showed up today, I cried."
Natalia D. Shafar, an economist and translator, came to the square with her daughter, Olya.
She said the events of the last months had created a "national idea," something Ukraine lacked before.
"Of course, we do not expect that overnight we will have a better life," she said, "but at least now we have hope."
Citizens go to the polls here Sunday for a repeat runoff election in a tumultuous presidential campaign marked by the poisoning of one candidate, an overturning of November results due to fraud, and a fierce struggle over whether Ukraine should turn toward the West or reinvigorate ties with Russia.
The rematch between Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko was set when the Supreme Court threw out last month's balloting on the grounds that authorities had systematically inflated Yanukovych's official total to give him a narrow victory.
The court made its ruling in the midst of what has been dubbed the "Orange Revolution" 17 days of massive protests by as many as 150000 Yushchenko supporters decked out in his campaign color.
Yanukovych has charged that a victory by Yushchenko, victim of the alleged assassination attempt, would lead to the country's enslavement by foreigners.
Yanukovych has received strong backing from Moscow, while the United States and the European Union played key roles in supporting Yushchenko's demand for a rematch.
In a fresh legal development Saturday, the nation's Constitutional Court ruled that a provision in an anti fraud electoral law approved by Parliament earlier this month unfairly restricted citizens' rights by limiting the use of home voting to the most severely disabled.
The court, which determines whether laws are constitutional, called for steps to allow home voting today by all people unable to reach the polls due to disabliities or poor health, if they requested it by 8 p.m. Saturday.
The decision could not be appealed.
The ruling endorsed all other aspects of the anti fraud law.
But by broadening home voting, it also raised fresh practical and legal issues, given the logistical difficulties and short time available to implement it.
"The Constitutional Court gave a chance to cast ballots to all voters who cannot move independently ,and it made it clear that the elections will be legal," the court's head, Mykola Selivon, told reporters.
"Now, no one will be able to say that the future president is illegitimate or elected unconstitutionally."
Passions remain high, however, with Yushchenko supporters still fearful of fraud and Yanukovych's backers convinced that victory was unfairly taken from him last month.
Both sides have warned of a risk of post election violence in this country of 48 million located between Russia and the European Union.
"I think it will be a colossal mistake on the part of the current regime if even one drop of blood is shed in the coming days," Yushchenko said at a Friday news conference.
He called on security forces and police "to prevent any conflict or manifestation of any aggression between rallies that Orange Revolution supporters and Yanukovych supporters will hold."
Top law enforcement officials said they were prepared to do just that.
"State security will do everything to prevent attempts by certain groups to violate law, order and people's constitutional rights," said Ihor Smeshko, head of the Security Service of Ukraine.
Widely viewed as a pro Western democratic reformer, Yushchenko has vowed to crack down on corruption, seek closer ties with the United States and the European Union, and complete this post Soviet state's transformation to a market economy.
Yanukovych, whose power base is in largely Russian speaking eastern Urkraine, has emphasized economic ties with Russia and a slower pace of change.
Citing strong economic growth and an increase in exports during his two years as prime minister, Yanukovych has charged that the European Union and the United States fear competition from Ukraine and have supported Yushchenko in order to turn the country into a colony.
He has also won support from older voters with a recent sharp boost in pensionpayments.
"We won't allow our elderly to be demeaned," Yanukovych declared at a rally in Kiev on Friday, the last day of campaigning.
"We won't allow anyone else to build our future for our own children.
Together, we will win."
About 12000 foreign observers have been dispatched to Ukraine by various organizations including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to help ensure an honest election.
Sunday's balloting is a repeat of a runoff round held on Nov 21.
The first round had 24 candidates and was held on Oct 31.
In that balloting Yushchenko finished a fraction of a percentage point ahead of Yanukovych after a slow vote count during which critics charged the Central Election Commission was doing everything possible to find a way to declare the prime minister the winner.
A largely revamped commission is in charge of Sunday's election.
Foreign observers charged after both earlier rounds that regional and local administrative and electoral officials loyal to Yanukovych and to outgoing President Leonid D. Kuchma, as well as the Central Election Commission, which was packed with their supporters, had cooperated in systematic voting fraud.
The U.S. embassy and several other Western embassies and foundations have financially supported exit polling in each round to assist in judging whether the official count is honest.
Centrist parliamentary speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn said he believed Saturday's ruling would "fully cut off possible lawsuits after the election."
"Fears that the election can be scuttled today no longer exist," Lytvyn said.
"We should know the name of the new president if not on Monday, then Tuesday."
Election authorities and the Yushchenko camp also portrayed the ruling as allowing for a legitimate election.
Still, the decision failed to eliminate the possibility of legal challenges or street protests by Yanukovych backers should he lose.
The bitterness of the campaign intensified in September when Yushchenko suddenly became ill and accused authorities of poisoning him in an assassination attempt.
Earlier this month, his doctors at a private clinic in Vienna, Austria, said tests confirmed he was the victim of dioxin poisoning, which has disfigured his face with pockmarks, cysts and darkened areas.
Dioxins are a class of toxic organic compounds usually produced during waste incineration or in manufacturing processes that use chlorine.
Yushchenko reportedly was poisoned with pure TCDD, which was an element in Agent Orange, a herbicide sprayed by U.S. troops during the Vietnam War to clear away dense vegetation.
Yushchenko fell sick the day after having late night food and drinks with Smeshko, the state security chief, and others.
He has implied that he believes there may be a foreign connection to the poisoning but has offered few details of what he believes happened.
He has said a full investigation should wait until the election is over.
Smeshko himself is widely seen as having reformist sympathies and would not necessarily be a leading suspect, were it to be determined that it was indeed an intentional poisoning.
"I believe this matter will not be difficult to solve," Yushchenko said at his Friday news conference.
"Today there is plenty of proof about how this poison got into Ukraine and how it got into the food."
He gave no further explanation.
Yushchenko and his supporters have made repeated reference during the campaign to revelations that Yanukovych, as a youth, served prison time for robbery and assault, and they charge that he is still a front man for powerful but corrupt business groups.
"I have honor," Yushchenko said during a televised debate Monday, in a comment that was ostensibly a rebuttal to charges of foreign funding of his campaign but was clearly meant to remind voters of Yanukovych's long ago run ins with the law.
"These hands have never stolen anything, I have never taken anything that wasn't mine.
I've never been imprisoned," Yushchenko said.
"I lead an honest life."
A biography distributed on behalf of Yanukovych says that "having suffered through a very tragic and tough childhood," the prime minister acknowledges regrettable youthful indiscretions, resulting in criminal charges that were eventually overturned by a Ukrainian court.
Opponents acknowledge that a court expunged his criminal record decades ago but question the reasons for that action.
Kuchma, who is stepping down after 10 years in power, charged in a nationally televised address Friday that both candidates had failed to place top priority on the nation's interests.
"There is no treacherous foe on its threshold who could threaten the existence of the Ukrainian people, but peace has left our land of plenty," Kuchma declared.
"What has happened to us then?
Both sides have been tempted to claim glory only for themselves and accuse their political rivals of all sins, both involuntary and fictitious."
Whoever wins, Kuchma said, the two rivals must "find a force in themselves to give a hand of cooperation to each other.
The Ukrainian people ,need this civil act."
Viktor A. Yushchenko has recovered enough from poisoning with the chemical dioxin that he should be able to serve as Ukraine's president, but he will continue to need treatment for months if not years, his doctors and foreign specialists said.
Still, they cautioned, his illness is virtually one of a kind, caused by ingesting a highly potent form of dioxin called TCDD.
Under such circumstances it is difficult to predict with great certainty the course of his recovery, they said, and most of the treatment he will need is somewhat experimental.
"The acute phase of his poisoning is now over, but he certainly needs more treatment," said Michael Zimpfer, president of the Rudolfinerhaus Hospital in Vienna, where Yushchenko was taken in September, vomiting and in severe pain, after consuming the deadly chemical.
"Most of the treatment can be done in the Ukraine, but he will have to return here for checkups."
Yushchenko, who is still suffering from disfiguring cysts on his face, will need long term treatment for his skin, Zimpfer said, because such cysts can persist for years.
He will need drugs to help his body dispel the dioxin, which usually is deposited in fat cells.
And he will need close monitoring for signs of cancer and abnormalities of fats in his blood, all possible aftereffects of the poisoning, Zimpfer added.
Yushchenko has consulted plastic surgeons in Israel, news reports there say.
But Zimpfer said he has strongly advised against surgery for now.
"Surgery could jeopardize his recovery because it is a trauma to the body in itself," he said.
Yushchenko's skin condition might recur even if it can be surgically improved for now, because his body still contains high levels of dioxin.
In fact, scientists say they have virtually no experience with this sort of poisoning, from a concentrated dose of TCDD.
"We don't even know the lethal dose for humans, because it's so rare," said Nigel Walker, a staff scientist at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park, N.C. "We know that it's not likely to kill people outright, but beyond that there are a lot of questions.
There have been very few instances of high level exposure."
Two weeks ago, doctors at Rudolfinerhaus announced that Yushchenko's blood tests revealed levels of dioxin that were 1000 times normal.
They had long suspected that his mysterious illness was caused by intentional poisoning, although they would not speculate on the source.
Days ago, a laboratory in the Netherlands that had received a sample of his blood for more sophisticated testing, reported that it contained TCDD, the most lethal form of dioxin.
It contained only pure TCDD, essentially confirming a poisoning.
"There is no way you could get this kind of pure TCDD level from an accident it's incredibly high," said Bharat Chandramouli, a dioxin specialist at Eno River Labs in Durham, N.C., which tests samples of soil and water in the United States for the chemical.
Almost all prior cases of dioxin exposure have resulted from environmental contamination, because dioxins are a toxic waste product of many industrial processes.
Human exposures tend to involve a mixture of chemicals and result in far lower blood levels.
Chandramouli added that TCDD is such a concentrated poison that an amount smaller than a grain of salt could produce the levels found in Yushchenko's blood.
This tiny amount would presumably be tasteless and odorless.
Since TCDD dissolves readily in oils, it could be slipped into food, Chandramouli said.
Yushchenko and his aides have said they believe that he was poisoned at a dinner with the director of Ukrainian State Security in September.
TCDD can be made in an advanced chemistry lab or can be bought in small amounts from chemical companies.
It is used only to calibrate sophisticated instruments that test for dioxins.
"No one's ever manufactured it in any great quantity and it has no legitimate uses," Chandramouli said.
The spraying of Agent Orange in the Vietnam War first alerted scientists to the toxicity of the dioxin, and people in Vietnam continue to suffer from exposure to it.
Other large scale contamination has occurred after industrial accidents or the dumping of toxic wastes.
Environmental exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer.
But doctors and dioxin specialists say that it is difficult to predict the effects of pure TCDD when it is ingested, and say that they will have to move forward with Yushchenko's case one step at a time.
Ukraine's Central Election Commission formally declared on Monday that opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko won last month's presidential election with 51.99 percent of the vote.
"The Central Election Commission declares Viktor Yushchenko elected president of Ukraine," Commission chief Yaroslav Davydovych said.
According to final results, Yushchenko won the election with 51.
99 percent of the vote compared to 44.20 percent received by former prime minister Viktor Yanukovych, the central election commission announced.
The announcement of the final results paves the way for parliament to set a date for Yushchenko's inauguration.
Yanukovych, meanwhile, has said he will appeal the official results to the supreme court once they are announced, although even he has admitted that the justices are unlikely to satisfy his complaints.
Ukraine's fractious Parliament again finds itself debating legislation intended to ensure a fair presidential vote and trim presidential powers, which has the potential to shape the nation's political system for years to come.
Prospects for a compromise at Wednesday's session appeared dim as supporters of opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko pushed strongly for electoral changes to close loopholes for fraud in the Dec 26 rerun of the election, but resisted the constitutional changes which would transfer some presidential powers over to Parliament.
A coalition of communists, socialists and pro government factions in Parliament don't oppose the electoral changes, but will only agree to pass them along with the constitutional changes.
Yushchenko has balked at the constitutional reforms, saying allies of outgoing President Leonid Kuchma want to steal his potential victory by weakening the presidency.
In a development that could have a dramatic effect on the scene, the Times of London Web site reported Wednesday that doctors who treated Yushchenko for a mysterious illness during the initial campaign have determined there "was an attempt on his life" with a biological or chemical agent or a rare poison.
"There is no longer a question for discussion," the newspaper quoted Dr Nikolai Korpan, who treated Yushchenko at the Rudolfnerhaus clinic in Vienna, Austria.
"We are now sure that we can confirm which substance cause this illness.
He received this substance from other people who had a specific aim."
The newspaper then said it asked Korpan if the aim had been to kill Yushchenko, to which the doctor was quoted as responding: "Yes, of course."
Yushchenko fell ill September 6 and was rushed to the Vienna clinic four days later.
Yushchenko has accused the Ukrainian authorities of poisoning him.
His detractors suggested he'd eaten some bad sushi.
Known for his ruggedly handsome, almost movie star looks, Yushchenko's skin now is severely pockmarked.
His face is haggard, swollen and partially paralyzed.
One eye often tears up.
Late last month, Korpan had said the cause of Yushchenko's illness remained "totally open."
He told the Times that the substance that was administered to Yushchenko would be identified in a matter of days, but physicians needed him to return to Vienna for an examination.
"We need to check him again here in Vienna.
If we received him today, we could finish the whole investigation in two or three days," Korpan was quoted.
Several thousand orange clad Yushchenko supporters, growing impatient over the lack of progress in passing the legislation, besieged Parliament Tuesday, chanting "Parasites!
Parasites!" as attempts to forge a compromise failed, with each side accusing the other of acting in bad faith.
The impasse in Parliament comes as Kuchma and his allies seek to slow Yushchenko's growing momentum following last Friday's Supreme Court ruling that canceled the Nov 21 runoff victory by the Kremlin backed Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych.
A breakthrough seemed near Monday, when parliamentary factions agreed to pass the changes all at once on condition that constitutional reform would be implemented after new parliamentary elections in 2006.
Yushchenko's allies hope to win a majority in Parliament that would make the amendments harmless for Yushchenko.
But the deal collapsed Tuesday when Yushchenko's supporters said that they would only consider constitutional changes after the Parliament approves electoral amendments and Kuchma signs them into law.
They also demanded that the president reshuffle the Central Election Commission, which was accused of covering up fraud.
Communist party chief Petro Symonenko and others accused Yushchenko of reneging on a pledge made during European Union brokered talks last week to vote for electoral and constitutional changes together.
"He has broken an international agreement, so how we can trust his faction in Parliament?"
Symonenko said during the parliamentary debate.
Yushchenko's allies say Kuchma and his clan are trying to thwart electoral changes.
"We don't trust this government which is trying to rape the nation, depriving it of the right to elect the president," opposition lawmaker Oleksandr Turchinov said.
Yushchenko supporters also have pushed for Yanukovych's resignation, but Kuchma has refused to fire him and instead, on Tuesday, approved his leave of absence for the campaign period, naming a deputy premier as caretaker.
Throngs of opposition demonstrators, many of them haggard after two week street vigils in freezing temperatures, pledged that they would maintain their raucous, often noisy vigil until the legislation passed.
"We have grown tired physically, but spiritually we are longing for a victory," said Olha Pokalchuk, 44.
"Our blockade will force these parasites to back down," echoed 67 year old Kiev resident Adam Litkovets.
Yanukovych's supporters, who briefly visited the capital early in the two week crisis, have retreated to their home regions in the east, along the border with Russia.
The exodus of Yanukovych's top allies continued, following the resignation of his campaign chief last week, with senior lawmaker Stepan Havrysh saying he wouldn't take part in Yanukovych's campaign.
In an effort apparently to expand his support base, Yanukovych has also sought to disassociate himself from the unpopular Kuchma and shed the image of being the president's puppet.
His new campaign chief, Taras Chornovil, accused Kuchma Tuesday of trying to discredit Yanukovych and said the president's billionaire son in law was financing Yushchenko's campaign.

Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned in an attempt to kill him during election campaigning in September, a British daily reported Wednesday, quoting the doctor who oversaw his treatment.
Doctors at Viennas Rudolfinerhaus clinic are within days of identifying the substance that left Yushchenkos face disfigured with cysts and lesions, Doctor Nikolai Korpan was quoted as telling The Times in a telephone interview.
Specialists in Britain, the United States and France had helped to establish that it was a biological agent, a chemical agent or, most likely, a rare poison that struck him down in the run up to the presidential election, he said.
Doctors needed to examine Yushchenko again at the clinic in Vienna to confirm their diagnosis but were in no doubt that the substance was administered deliberately, he was quoted as saying.
"This is no longer a question for discussion," Doctor Korpan said.
"We are now sure that we can confirm which substance caused this illness.
He received this substance from other people who had a specific aim."
Asked if the aim had been to kill him, Korpan said: "Yes, of course."
Proof that Yushchenko was deliberately poisoned would be a devastating blow for his rival, the prime minister, Viktor Yanukovich, as the two candidates prepare for a repeat of a presidential run off on December 26, The Times said.
It would raise questions about whether the poisoning was ordered by Yanukovich, his allies, or even the Kremlin, which fears that Yushchenko will take Ukraine out of its sphere of influence by joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union, it said.
Yushchenko had said recently that he would soon reveal proof that his opponents had tried to assassinate him, but a spokeswoman said he had no plans to travel to Vienna, the newspaper said.
Yushchenko fell ill on September 6 and was rushed to Rudolfinerhaus four days later with severe abdominal pain and lesions on his face and trunk, The Times said.
His liver, pancreas and intestines were swollen and his digestive tract covered in ulcers, but doctors could not explain the symptoms.
Against their advice he went back on the campaign trail after a week, but returned to the clinic two weeks later with back pain.
His Austrian doctors had said previously they had no proof of a criminal poisoning.
Nevertheless his campaign staff have insisted the medical exam revealed that Yushchenko's illness had been caused "by a viral infection and chemical substances that are not usually found in food products."
Some Oregon and Washington residents are getting free dryers as part of a test of smart, power saving appliances.
The idea is to have appliances sense stresses in the nation's power supply caused by such things as a tree falling on a major electrical line or a power plant unexpectedly going offline.
The appliances could automatically reduce their power usage to help stabilize the system.
"It's not about saving power overall, but saving power when you most need it at times of high pressure on the power grid," said Robert Pratt, a staff scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
The dryer, for instance, could turn off its heating unit for a few minutes to momentarily conserve power, while still tumbling your clothes to avoid wrinkles.
There's also talk of a refrigerator smart enough to know when and when not to defrost the freezer.
"We want to show there are no hiccups with the technology," Pratt said.
"But we're also trying to show that nobody notices if the heating element on their dryer is shut off for 5 minutes."
Researchers are conducting a pilot using a $1.5 million (euro1.25 million) grant from the U.S. Energy Department.
They contend enough gadgets like these in public use could help to avert blackouts like the one that darkened the Northeast in 2003.
With oil prices surging and increased talk of global warming, venture capitalists are straying from their traditional focus on computer technology and biotechnology to put increasing sums into alternative energy companies.
Venture activity is way up in the past six months, with more energy companies presenting business plans to investors and more high priced deals being done.
Over the summer, four solar energy companies attracted a stunning $60 million (euro50 million) in a round of high priced financings that generated the first whispers an investment bubble may be forming.
For venture capitalists, "it's a very nascent market," says Warren Weiss, general partner at Foundation Capital.
"It almost reminds you of looking at the Internet market 10 years before (browser pioneer) Netscape" unleashed the dot com gold rush, he says.
Weiss says that in the past 18 months his firm has made three energy investments in an attempt to identify where advances in technology cheap, powerful chips, more capable software and broadband communications will have an impact on the energy business.
"You couldn't do it 10 years ago," he says.
"We think the market is ready."
Weiss is not the only one to decide the time is right.
Many white shoe venture firms have named energy specialists and written funding checks, including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Mohr Davidow Ventures, which became one of the year's more active firms with its first three investments.
"We see a great market opportunity," says Erik Straser, general partner at Mohr Davidow, who studied the business for almost three years before getting involved.
"There's lots of innovation."
Two of the firm's startups Energy Innovations Inc. of Pasadena, Calif., and Nonosolar Inc. of Palo Alto make solar cells while the third, Jadoo Power Systems Inc. of Folsom, California, makes fuel cells.
According to a recent survey, venture investments in alternative energy companies jumped this year, although they remain a small slice of the overall business.
Venture capitalists put $139.5 million (euro117 million) into solar, wind and geothermal energy companies through the second quarter of the year, already surpassing the $95 million (euro79.5 million) they spent in all of 2004, according to the National Venture Capital Association, Thomson Financial and PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Other groups monitoring the market see a similar rise in spending, if not as steep.
Nth Power, a venture firm focused on energy, calculates venture firms and venture arms of corporations put $690 million (euro577.5 million) in emerging technology companies in 2004 and already close to $533 million (euro446 million) through September of this year.
The numbers are higher because Nth Power includes investments not only energy producers but technology companies such as software firms that make products for the energy business.
"There's no doubt we are seeing quite a bit more activity," says Tim Woodward, managing director at Nth Power.
Cleantech Venture Network LLC also is seeing more funding take place.
The research organization says $189.4 million (euro158.5 million) went into energy related venture deals in the second quarter, up 42 percent from the first quarter.
The company also uses a broad definition of an energy company that includes startups making energy generating equipment, as well as batteries and products to improve energy efficiency, such as low power lighting.
More money is on the way.
Between 80 and 100 funds are out raising new money to invest in "cleantech," a term that includes energy companies and environmental businesses with transportation, water purification and air improvement projects, says Nicholas Parker, chairman of Cleantech.
The recent surge in energy investing isn't hard to understand.
With oil prices around $65 a barrel, alternative energy sources become more competitive, especially with subsidies in many countries and new subsidies in the United States.
Venture capitalists also see opportunities in the fragile power transmission grid.
"The first shock to the system was the Northeast blackout" of 2003, says Woodward.
Yet, even as the health of the Earth may be under assault from global warming, the potential demand for power remains enormous.
Venture capitalists say there are good and bad sides to the surge in energy investing.
On one hand, "it's easier to put together investment syndicates than it used to be," says Peter Edwards, a partner at Altira Group LLC, an energy VC.
On the other, "I would say there is more competition," he says.
So far, the valuations being paid in energy deals remain reasonable.
But prices are creeping higher, and some VCs say the danger of a bubble is real.
Nanosolar, Miasole of San Jose, California, Energy Innovations and HelioVolt Corp. of Austin, Texas, closed on a total of $60 million (euro50 million) in a few short weeks, leading some to suggest the category is overheated.
"I think the (solar) market will absolutely continue to grow," says Woodward.
But "not every one of those companies will succeed."

Retiree Claire L. McGrath no longer immediately opens her utility bills from National Grid because she said it's too upsetting to see the skyrocketing cost of heating and lighting her two family home in this city.
She just peeks at the amount, and then later in the month expresses her anger at the power company by making out her check to "National Greed."
Bill Driscoll, a construction worker, also said he pays too much for electricity and natural gas.
But he appreciated utility crews' quick response to a power outage caused by a windstorm last month.
"We have hard winters here, and when we lose power, the linemen bust their butts to restore it.
That costs money," said Driscoll, 36, of Pennellville.
With natural gas prices spiking in the past six months because of increased demand, National Grid has become the target of barbs from customers and area politicians, some of whom are calling for Syracuse to generate its own electricity.
Still, others remain leery of the British company that four years ago took over Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., which had deep roots here and provided energy for much of upstate New York.
Last month, National Grid announced plans for a $7.3 billion takeover of KeySpan Corp., the company that supplies electricity and gas to customers of the Long Island Power Authority.
If regulators approve the deal, National Grid will be primarily an energy producer for residents of Nassau and Suffolk counties, LIPA will continue to own the poles and wires, and make service calls.
That differs from upstate, where National Grid delivers power generated by others.
Regardless of this key difference, McGrath advised Long Island residents to be skeptical of National Grid based on her recent experiences.
"I don't believe them when they say it's not their fault that my bill is out of whack," said the 80 year old neighborhood activist, who estimated her monthly bill has increased by more than $100 since 2001.
In the past three months, her bills have ranged from $220 to $375.
"A lot of people are suffering and National Greed doesn't seem to care."
National Grid officials acknowledged the difficulty that some homeowners and businesses are having in paying much higher bills since last fall.
But the utility, they said, has no control over prices for gas or electricity, which also have risen because many electric generating plants use gas.
"We go out and buy the commodity, and whatever it costs, we pass along to the customer in conjunction with the bill that they get for delivery," said William F. Edwards, the company's president of New York distribution.
"We are stuck in the middle (between ratepayers and energy producers) ,But we try to do the best that we can to make payment arrangements with customers, to help them figure out how to use less product to make the bill lower."
Edwards added that National Grid has contained the costs it controls delivery charges for gas have only gone down since the mid 1990s and those for electricity fell by 8 percent after the takeover of Niagara Mohawk in 2002.
Despite some complaints about rude customer service agents and frequent power outages from a dozen ratepayers interviewed at the Carousel Center mall earlier this week, National Grid has improved its performance.
The number of complaints fell to 2492 last year compared with 3718 in 2003, according to figures from the state Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities.
National Grid has 1.5 million electric customers and 560000 gas customers stretching from Buffalo in the west, Watertown in the north and Albany in the east.
In Syracuse, several manufacturers and business groups said the transition from Niagara Mohawk to National Grid had been seamless.
The name changed, but not the personnel.
Niagara Mohawk has been a fixture in Syracuse for generations, cobbled together from smaller utilities in 1929 by financier J.P. Morgan and others.
The company's headquarters, along a now filled in stretch of the Erie Canal, is an Art Deco gem whose "Spirit of Light" sculpture was meant to woo Depression era ratepayers on the benefits of electricity.
A huge power cut hit much of Los Angeles on Monday and emergency services were put on an immediate alert.
The authorities were investigating the cause of the blackout, which hit a swathe of the sprawling city from North Hollywood, through Burbank and downtown, to southern Los Angeles.
The outage affected power to the Los Angeles police department headquarters but the fire department said it had not suffered a major impact.
Police and fire services were put on "tactical alert", spokesmen told US media.
Los Angeles fire department spokesman Jim Wells told CNN television there had "major power disruption" throughout the city, many reports of people stuck in building elevators but "no major problems".
Los Angeles airport was running on backup power, according to CNBC.
The United States has suffered a number of power crises in recent years.
In August 2003, 50 million homes lost power in New York and the rest of northeast United States.
California imposed rolling power cuts in 2001 because of a failed deregulation scheme, the effect of a drought and several other circumstances that put strains on the power grid.
While conceding that utility workers goofed when they snipped electrical wires that cut power to half of Los Angeles, DWP and union officials clashed Tuesday over the agency's response and whether the impact of the outage could have been minimized.
Ron Deaton, general manager of the Department of Water and Power, told the City Council the incident occurred about 12:30 p.m. Monday, while workers were upgrading a receiving station in Toluca Lake.
The crew mistakenly cut two wires while the electrical circuit was still active, setting off a chain reaction outage that shut down businesses, stalled elevators, caused massive traffic jams from the San Fernando Valley to South Los Angeles and sparked fears of a terrorist attack.
"There was a mistake and we are going to take a look at what happened to make sure it doesn't happen again," Deaton said.
"The good news out of this is that the system worked the way it was supposed to.
The system protected itself by shutting down, giving us time to stabilize it and bring it back up."
Deaton said the agency is studying ways to reduce the impact of future outages and how to better inform the public about problems.
But Brian D'Arcy head of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 18 said the disruption could have been minimized had the DWP been willing to pay technicians a higher wage differential to do the work at night, when power usage is lower.
"They shouldn't have done it in the middle of the day when people are coming back from lunch and turning their computers on," D'Arcy said.
But Deaton questioned the value of doing the work at night.
"From a public safety standpoint, I'm not sure we would want the power out when it's nighttime and dark out," Deaton said.
The IBEW is awaiting City Council action on a controversial five year contract that would give its 8000 members raises of as much as 30 percent.
The union has threatened to strike Oct 1 if the contract is not approved.
Under questioning from Councilman Dennis Zine, Deaton rejected any suggestion that the outage was in retaliation for city delays in approving the deal.
"There is no indication this was done on purpose," Deaton said.
"I would point out it was the hardworking DWP employees who were able to stabilize the system and restore power in an hour and a half."
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa sent a letter to Deaton, ordering a report within a week that details what happened as well as the agency's plan to avoid future problems.
City Councilman Tony Cardenas and others questioned the time it took DWP officials to report the cause and extent of the problem.
Coming the day after a masked al Qaida operative sent a videotaped message pointing to Los Angeles as the next terrorist target of attacks, the outage escalated tension and fear as officials and the public waited for word on the cause of the blackout.
"People didn't know what was going on other than the power was out," said Cardenas, who chairs the council's Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which oversees the DWP.
"We had people who were trying to drive across this city to check on their children and they didn't know if we were under attack or something else was going on."
Deaton defended the DWP's actions, saying he wanted to avoid misinformation.
"As soon as we knew what had happened, I went down and met with the news media to tell them what we knew," Deaton said.
"I didn't want to get the wrong information out there."
Cardenas said he was also concerned about security.
"There is a particular concern that the department be aware of the numerous potential vulnerabilities of the system," Cardenas said, adding he wanted to see a report on the locations where the entire system could be tripped up as well as training of workers.
Deaton said the work crews involved with the modernization program have received specialized training and had successfully installed the new equipment at 39 other locations.
The workers were installing automated monitoring controls to provide department officials with immediate information about the status of its system.
Part of the problem at the Toluca Lake site, he said, is that it is the central point for numerous power lines coming into the city and its outage triggered a wider impact than normal.
Deaton said his department is working to determine whether a system can be designed that would limit the size of the area affected while not damaging the entire electrical system.
NRG Energy Inc. agreed Sunday to buy privately held power generator Texas Genco LLC for $5.8 billion (euro4.82 billion), in a deal that furthers consolidation in the electricity generation industry.
NRG will pay $4 billion (euro3.32 billion) in cash and $1.8 billion (euro1.49 billion) in common and preferred stock, and will also assume $2.5 billion (euro2.08 billion) in Texas Genco debt.
The deal comes four months after Duke Energy Corp. agreed to acquire rival Cinergy Corp. in a stock deal worth nearly $9 billion (euro7.47 billion).
In a statement, the two companies said the combination will create a premier wholesale power generation company with broad geographic reach.
Once the deal is completed, the combined company will have a domestic generating capacity of almost 24000 megawatts.
"Texas Genco is an ideal strategic fit with NRG," David Crane, NRG's president and CEO said in a statement.
"The strengths of its people and its assets align closely with our own, bolstering NRG's platform for growth and our ability to drive value for our shareholders."
West Windsor, New Jersey based NRG owns and operates power generating facilities in the Northeast, South Central and West Coast regions of the United States.
The company also has ownership interests in power generating facilities in Australia, Germany and Brazil.
Altogether the company has about 15000 megawatts of power producing capacity, about 2000 megawatts internationally and the majority in the United States.
NRG, founded as a unit of Xcel Energy Inc. in 1989, built or acquired more than 50 power plants in the United States, Europe, Asia and South America.
But the company, which had borrowed heavily to make the acquisitions, couldn't pay its debt when the energy prices collapsed in 2001.
The company filed for bankruptcy protection, enabling it to eliminate about $6 billion (euro4.98 billion) in debt and restructure.
NRG emerged from bankruptcy protection in December 2003.
The company moved its corporate headquarters in January from Minneapolis to New Jersey.
NRG said in a statement that it expects the combined NRG and Texas Genco will increase NRG'S earnings and cash flow per share, giving the company greater financial strength and allowing it to pursue other growth opportunities.
Texas Genco, is the second largest power generation company in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, a power grid which includes most of the state, and is capable of producing roughly 11000 megawatts of power.
Texas Genco used to be a majority owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, which provides electrical service to the Houston area.
Nineteen percent of the company was traded publicly when CenterPoint owned it.
A private equity consortium of The Blackstone Group, Hellman & Friedman LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. LP and Texas Pacific Group owns Texas Genco.
Texas deregulated its energy market in 2002.
Texas Genco owns fully or in part 10 power plants.
It has a 44 percent stake in the South Texas Project nuclear plant, which provides power to more than 1 million homes in South Texas.
Most of the companies power plants are located in and around Houston and in southeast Texas.
Major portions of the city lost power for more than an hour around lunchtime after utility workers mistakenly cut several cables, causing a short that sizzled through the system.
Police discounted terrorism almost immediately, though the timing of the outage caused some concern: It came a day after Sept 11 and the airing of videotape in which a purported al Qaida member threatened Los Angeles.
"We were all freaked out, no doubt," said downtown high rise worker Vicki Brakl.
Roughly 2 million people were affected by the resultant power surge and outages, which trapped some in elevators and snarled intersections regionwide.
All power was restored by 3 p.m. (2200 GMT) Monday, about 2 1/2 hours later.
At the height of the blackout, many office workers seized the chance for an extended lunch on a mild afternoon, even as police and fire sirens echoed in the background.
"I'm just reading the paper and seeing a lot of my colleagues out here, so I guess we all have a good excuse," said Ludwig Welsh as he ate his midday meal outside his downtown insurance office.
There were few reports of injuries.
Two men were briefly hospitalized after inhaling toxic fumes at an oil refinery when smoke backed up after the power went out, fire officials said.
Though the Police Department ordered all officers to stay on their shifts and surveyed the city by helicopter, law enforcement officials dismissed sabotage even before the utility explained what happened.
Still, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa recognized that the timing "created a heightened sense of concern."
The outage began at about 12:30 p.m. (1930 GMT) when workers installing an automated alert system cut several wires simultaneously, instead of one at a time, according to Ed Miller of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.
That caused the short that led to all the trouble.
Utility officials initially said the outage occurred when the cables were incorrectly reconnected.
The outage spread north into the San Fernando Valley and hit neighboring cities, including Burbank and Glendale.
But because of the region's patchwork utility system, pockets of power remained, even as adjacent areas served by the city run Los Angeles Department of Water and Power were dark.
Though some power experts said the system performed correctly given the surge, it was the latest indication of the electrical grid's vulnerability.
Two weeks ago, half a million Southern California Edison and DWP customers lost power for 30 minutes when a transformer shut down automatically because an alarm mistakenly went off.
A blackout in August 2003 that started in Ohio after tree limbs touched a power line cascaded across the East and into Canada, affecting 50 million people.
That led to demands for more reliability and preparedness.
Inside one downtown high rise Monday, Albert Vasquez had to pry his way out of an elevator that shut down after the power failed.
"It was bizarre," he said.
"It went completely dark."
Vasquez, 27, a customer service representative, opened the doors with his hands and went outside.
Across the city, traffic was snarled at intersections when stop lights went dark.
Katie Cerio, a stylist for TV commercials, said traffic signals were out in her neighborhood.
"They've got people directing traffic, but it's definitely a bit chaotic," Cerio said as she drove.
"But now I just entered West Hollywood and the traffic lights seems to be on."
Gas station pumps stopped working, car washes came to a halt, assembly lines stalled and restaurant machinery quit in the middle of lunch hour.
At Bob's Big Boy restaurant in Burbank, power was out for about 90 minutes.
"All we could serve were salads and cold sandwiches, no hamburgers," manager Frank Rodriguez said.
At the downtown YMCA, staff used flashlights to help usher exercisers from the pool and other areas to locker rooms so they could dress before evacuating.
Before its power was restored, UCLA Medical Center was on backup generators and reported no danger to patients.
Childrens Hospital Los Angeles was on backup power and doctors planned to suspend all unneeded operations the rest of the day, a spokesman said.
The city's transit trains ran during the outage, but with major delays.
"I walk faster than that," said commuter Jennifer Crocker, 27.
Contributing to this report were Associated Press Writers Alex Veiga, Jeff Wilson, Kate Butler, Solvej Schou, Jeremiah Marquez and Chris T. Nguyen in Los Angeles, Jennifer Coleman in Sacramento, and Robert Tanner in New York.
A blackout hit downtown government buildings, Chinatown and adjacent areas, but backup power kept key parts of City Hall and police headquarters running.
It was the third significant electrical failure in the city since mid September.
The blackout began about 9 a.m. and cut power to as many as 1000 customers, affecting City Hall, the Los Angeles County Hall of Administration and police headquarters at Parker Center, said Gale Harris, a spokeswoman for the city Department of Water and Power, which provides electricity to 1.4 million customers.
Power was restored shortly before 6 p.m.
The cause of the outage remained under investigation, although officials ruled out terrorism or human error, said Carol Tucker, another DWP spokeswoman.
She said brief power outages were likely through the night, as engineers planned to test the system.
"Outages just happen periodically, but we do seem to be having an inordinate number," Tucker said.
About 100 downtown commercial customers were still without power at midafternoon.
Backup power kicked in at police headquarters, though parts of the complex were dark until electricity was fully restored there before noon, Harris said.
A City Council meeting was in progress when the lights went out, but the meeting continued as City Hall switched to backup power.
At the height of the blackout, traffic signals that had gone dark snarled traffic through parts of Chinatown and in sections of downtown.
Power failures affected 2 million people Sept 12, while 40000 customers in downtown and neighborhoods to the east lost service Sept 23.
The first outage lasted 1 1/2 hours after a utility crew cut several control lines in the San Fernando Valley.
A subsequent report by the DWP cited faulty work plans, a failure to double check the designs and miscommunication.
The second power failure involved a substation where a bank of transformers that had been shut down for maintenance was brought back online.
That accidentally triggered other banks of transformers to go off line.
Power was restored in about five minutes and the cause was under investigation.
Twenty five months after a blackout darkened cities from New York to Toronto and Detroit, the U.S. Energy Department and its Canadian counterpart held their first public technical discussion on the episode Thursday to talk about one factor widely considered to have been behind it: the deregulation of the electric system.
Engineers, government officials and executives said at the meeting that amid its restructuring the industry needed further changes, to reduce the frequency of blackouts as utilities that formerly generated power, transmitted it and delivered it are broken up into separate entities of competing businesses.
"The most serious mistake we can make is pretending that markets do things that they do not do," said Kellan Fluckiger, executive director of the electricity division at the Alberta Department of Energy.
"Markets allocate risk, they allocate capital, they provide price signals.
Markets do not have a conscience, they do not provide social policy, and they do not do things they are not paid to do."
For example, participants at the meeting said, utilities that once ran the system sometimes added transmission lines to increase reliability of electric power.
When they did so, their costs would be reimbursed through the regulatory process, now there is less incentive to take on such efforts, and several participants pointed out that in fact investment in transmission had lagged.
The blackout of 2003 began on Aug 14 and in some places lasted more than two days.
A binational report issued three months afterward did not list deregulation as a cause, instead citing factors like failure to trim trees, train operators and install control systems that could have kept track of the status of all power lines and generators.
Much of the investigation leading to that report was managed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the architect of utility restructuring in the United States.
The report called for a separate study it did not say by whom on the role of deregulation in the blackout, but that study has never been done.
Experts at Thursday's meeting said the changes in the industry had had several adverse effects, including a loss of experience among personnel.
One member of the panel, Jack Casazza, a 60 year veteran of the industry, said the changes had brought lawyers and MBA's to the head of these competitive companies, rather than engineers.
"They may be decent people, fine bankers, fine lawyers, wonderful golfers," Casazza said, "but they don't have the background."
He also said that while the old utilities had often maintained large reserve margins of electricity, to minimize the chance of shortages, some market participants now preferred lower margins, to drive up prices.
Others pointed out that information like a power plant's maximum capacity, and its state of repair on any given day, was now considered proprietary and so was not readily available to system operators, which manage regional power grids.
The North American Electric Reliability Council, whose members come from utilities, marketers, customers and federal agencies, said in a paper submitted for the meeting that the increased demands that deregulation's wider trading had placed on the transmission system "require the grid to be operated closer to its reliability limits more of the time than was the case in the past."
That requires better training and control equipment, said the group, which was founded after a vast blackout in the Northeast in 1965.
Still, not all the industry's changes have affected reliability adversely, participants said.
In a paper written for the meeting, Dave Goulding, chief executive of the Ontario Independent Electricity System Operator, said that "competition leads to trade and greater interconnectedness," which could boost reliability.
The energy bill signed into law by President Bush on Aug 8 provides a mechanism for creating mandatory reliability rules.
The legislation allows the federal government to designate a private group, probably the North American Electric Reliability Council, as an official "electric reliability organization," with authority to set the rules.
But that group pointed out in its paper that while the designated organization would assess the adequacy of the system, it would not have the authority to require anybody to build a generating station or a transmission line.
With a $7.3 billion deal in hand to take over KeySpan Corp., British energy giant National Grid PLC said it expects to wring roughly $200 million a year in savings out of the two companies, without imposing any layoffs.
But how much of that $200 million finds its way back to the companies' nearly 2 million customers in Massachusetts and 6 million in other states as opposed to National Grid shareholders may not be clear for months.
Negotiating dividends from the takeover for customers will be a key issue facing utility regulators in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and other states where the two utilities operate.
The projected cost savings from uniting the companies amount to about 10 percent of their combined annual operating expenses, according to Michael E. Jesanis, chief executive of National Grid USA, the British conglomerate's American unit in Westborough.
Some savings will come from job reductions through attrition and early retirement incentives, as well as combining "back office functions," selling off surplus real estate for redevelopment, and using increased buying clout to get discounts from suppliers and vendors, Jesanis said.
The deal, which the companies hope to close early next year, would make National Grid one of the three biggest combined electric and gas utilities in the United States.
"We're quite comfortable that we can meet our efficiency objectives without having our employees be harmed," Jesanis said.
"There's a lot of other sources of savings besides people."
In Massachusetts, National Grid employs about 2500 people, KeySpan 1800.
Of the 169 Bay State cities and towns where National Grid operates, 69 are communities where KeySpan also provides gas service.
When National Grid predecessor Massachusetts Electric Co. bought the former Eastern Edison a utility south of Boston, in 2000, the company pledged to cut rates and then freeze them for five years to return some of the savings from combining the companies to customers.
Mass. Electric and later National Grid kept that promise.
Jesanis said National Grid will be open to a range of possibilities, including rate cuts, rate freezes, or commitments to increase spending on energy efficiency programs or accelerated gas and electric system maintenance and upgrades.
Asked whether National Grid can commit to returning a specific fraction of the $200 million annual savings to ratepayers, Jesanis said, "It's premature to define an actual split, but we'll certainly be having that discussion with our regulators.
We're quite flexible."
Frank Gorke, energy advocate for the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization, said, "The burden is on National Grid and KeySpan to prove to consumers, regulators that this is going to be a good deal for consumers."
Brian McCarthy, a senior official with the Utility Workers Union of America, said National Grid has kept to promises to avoid layoffs in past mergers.
"But the fact of the matter is you have less employment opportunities going forward, and I question whether these things ever really do result in savings for the ratepayer or whether they just pass it all on to the shareholders," McCarthy said.
In Massachusetts, the Department of Telecommunications and Energy will have only limited power to review the deal and demand benefits for ratepayers because it will involve a combination of the holding companies that own the utilities, not the utilities themselves.
The state attorney general's office, which represents consumers in utility rate cases, said it will review the transaction.
"We will work to make sure that consumers see the benefits of this deal through the lowest possible rates and high quality service," said Sarah Nathan, spokeswoman for Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly.
Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who met with top executives of both companies Monday, said in an interview, "On the surface, I think it's a good deal.
As I see it, on the face of it, meeting with both teams, I think it's going to be a benefit to the city.
They're going to continue the programs that they're involved in the city" including energy efficiency assistance programs for low income households and cultural activity sponsorships.
Seth Kaplan, senior attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation, a Boston environmental group, said both National Grid and KeySpan have made stronger commitments than most utilities to programs promoting renewable energy sources for electric generation and energy conservation.
"It's a deal that could have a potential good side to it in energy efficiency," Kaplan said.
National Grid will probably continue to use the "very good KeySpan name" for gas operations, at least for the near term, Jesanis said.
In recent months the company has replaced several venerable corporate monikers including Mass. Electric, Narragansett Electric in Rhode Island, and Niagara Mohawk in New York, with the National Grid brand.

The intense heat wave sweeping much of the United States is pushing electricity demand to new records, a situation that is stressing the power grid, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.
Little more than a month into summer, said the report, new benchmarks for daily electricity use already have been set in Atlanta, Cincinnati, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, among other cities.
New York set a new record Tuesday of 32075 megawatts, breaking the previous high set just last week.
The United States as a whole likely set a new record for weekly electricity use last week, topping by as much as 4 percent the previous record demand of 90640 gigawatt hours, set Aug 3, 2002, according to the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing major utilities.
A gigawatt represents one billion watts.
The surge reflects not just the unusually widespread heat, but also a recent upward creep in industrial electricity usage, the report said.
It said that the surging demand provides another big stress test for the nation's power grid.
In August 2003, a big Northeast blackout disrupted service to 50 million people.
Two years earlier, soaring prices and isolated blackouts rolled across California.
Since those events, regulators and power companies have made changes in their operations designed to help them stay abreast of system conditions and head off problems.
So far, the improved planning, combined with the addition of a number of new power plants, seems to be helping the system's reliability, the report said.
The omnibus energy bill making its way through Congress also could bring changes, by putting in place enforceable electricity reliability standards that could force further improvements and spur a new generation of nuclear power plants, it added.
Still, the report said that the run up in demand is using up a cushion of surplus power that has moderated prices in recent years.
That increases the risk of supply problems developing in a few areas.
Some places, too, are poorly served by transmission lines, raising concern that a rapid boost in demand could create temporary shortages.
As a fuel cell housed in a metal box about the size of a small SUV hummed quietly in the parking lot of the Babylon, N.Y., Town Hall with puffs of steam floating out of its exhaust pipe, the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, Richard Kessel, announced early this month that the utility was seeking a company to build and operate a 10 megawatt fuel cell that would provide enough energy to power 10000 homes.
"This will be the first project of its kind in America," Kessel said of the plan to feed fuel cell energy directly to the power grid.
"We're taking fuel cells to a new level."
Fuel cells are "clean" energy generators that convert hydrogen to electricity by a chemical process, requiring no combustion.
The exhaust is water, heat and some carbon dioxide.
Currently, most fuel cells extract the hydrogen from natural gas.
The proposed plant, to be situated at a substation in West Babylon, is to replace a "farm" of 75 smaller fuel cells now being tested there.
LIPA does not expect homeowner electricity rates to increase as a result of the new project, Kessel said, even though fuel cells generate electricity at a higher cost than combustion generators.
Three days after the announcement, in the quiet living room of a house in West Islip, Sister Gertrude O'Brien flipped a switch on the reading lamp over her easy chair.
The lamp, one of several appliances in the house powered by the fuel cell sitting in the middle of the backyard, dutifully lighted the room.
"I think it's kind of ugly," Sister Gertrude said of the bulky fuel cell out back, "but I would say that the benefits greatly outweigh the aesthetics."
Those benefits were visible on a day in December when a car hit a utility pole nearby.
The whole neighborhood lost power, but Sister Gertrude and the two other nuns who live in the house could turn on their lights and watch television.
Next door, when the Rev. Douglas Dower returned to his home that same night, he noticed all the homes on his block were dark.
When he got inside, he checked his appliances.
"When I opened the refrigerator door, the light went on and everything inside was still cold," Dower said.
The fuel cell in his yard, hooked up through conduits and pipes in the cellar to provide heat, light and power to essential appliances in his home, did not need the LIPA grid.
Sister Gertrude and Father Doug, as they are called at Good Samaritan Hospital where they both work, live in hospital owned homes that are two of several fuel cell test sites across the Island.
Others include buildings at Brookhaven National Laboratory, a McDonald's restaurant and the Babylon Town Hall.
Baron Davis, who lives with his wife and two young sons in a home they rent in Mineola, N.Y., first came to live on Long Island from Anchorage, Alaska, in August 2003, landing at Newark (N.J.) Liberty International Airport only 20 minutes after a widespread blackout had knocked out power to most of the East Coast.
With nowhere else to go, Davis rented a car and drove with his sons to the Mineola home where the family had just moved.
"It was a nightmare, I couldn't even see road signs," Davis said of that harrowing six hour drive.
But he is feeling more secure these days.
Since early January, Davis' home has been one of seven in Mineola, owned by Winthrop Hospital, that are powered and heated partly by a fuel cell.
"They basically created a ditch and connected pipes over a week," he said of the installation by Plug Power Inc., the Albany based company that manufactured the fuel cells for the tests.
"It really didn't create any problems."
The fuel cell power has been more reliable so far.
Before the fuel cell was hooked up, the lights in the house would flicker every day, he said, and he often had to reboot his computer.
"Ever since they've had this on, I haven't seen any glitches," Davis, an unemployed electrical engineer, said of the fuel cell.
"No lights flickering on and off anymore."
But fuel cells like those used in Long Island homes are too expensive, about $75000, and require servicing too often to be a viable residential alternative right now, according to Roger Saillant, president and chief executive of Plug Power.
The main function of the tests is to improve the technology.
"You can compare it to the combustion engine in a car billions have been built, there's an opportunity to learn from each one of them," Saillant said.
"Of all the fuel cells in all the world, there's probably not 2000 of them."
The LIPA plan to use fuel cells to supply the grid is part of an effort to generate 25 percent of the utility's energy using renewable sources by 2014, a goal set by the New York state Public Service Commission last year, Kessel said.
The utility has also already contracted with Florida Power and Light to build a windmill farm 40 to 50 windmill turbines about six miles from the Island's south shore, near Robert Moses State Park, providing 140 megawatts of power to the grid.
Long Island's power demands averaged about 2989 megawatts per hour in 2004 during peak hours.
But while windmills create electricity from ocean winds, the fuel cells used for LIPA's project will use a fossil fuel to operate: natural gas.
The public service commission includes fuel cells in its policy, a commission spokesman, David Flanagan, said, to spur the development of cells that will one day run on renewable resources like methane or electrical current.
Gordian Raacke, head of the environmental group Renewable Energy Long Island, discussed the future of fuel cells at the Babylon Town Hall news conference, where he praised LIPA's newest energy project.
Raacke powers his East End home with solar panels.
Under a LIPA plan that allows homeowners using solar energy to "run their meters backward," Raacke feeds electricity back to the grid and gets credits on his electric bill instead of charges.
"I don't pay anything for electricity," he said.
"When the day is overcast and I need energy, I use the credits."
The fuel cell of the future, Raacke believes, will be able to extract and store hydrogen from solar and wind generated energy, so if he had one in his house, he would not need to tap the grid on a cloudy day.
"Fuel cell technology provides an important link in the alternative energy chain," he said.
"It closes the loop."
Saillant of Plug Power said it is indeed possible for fuel cells to store hydrogen gas taken from a mixture of water and the electrical current generated by wind turbines and solar panels.
Ideally, the stored gas would be used on a calm or overcast day to continue powering and heating the home.
But he estimates that fuel cells not requiring natural gas are, under the best federal financing conditions, at least 15 years away.
For now in Mineola, Davis is happy with the first month of fuel cell power in his home.
"Having experienced a major outage, I can really appreciate this," he said.
Hundreds of times a day, hackers try to slip past cyber security into the computer network of Constellation Energy Group Inc., a Baltimore power company with customers around the country.
"We have no discernable way of knowing who is trying to hit our system," said John Collins, chief risk officer for Constellation, which operates Baltimore Gas and Electric.
"We just know it's being hit."
Hackers have caused no serious damage to systems that feed the nation's power grid, but their untiring efforts have heightened concerns that electric companies have failed to adequately fortify defenses against a potential catastrophic strike.
The fear: In a worst case scenario, terrorists or others could engineer an attack that sets off a widespread blackout and damages power plants, prolonging an outage.
Patrick H. Wood III, the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, warned top electric company officials in a private meeting in January that they need to focus more heavily on cyber security.
Wood also has raised the issue at several public appearances.
Officials will not say whether new intelligence points to a potential terrorist strike, but Wood stepped up his campaign after officials at the Energy Department's Idaho National Laboratory showed him how a skilled hacker could cause serious problems.
Wood declined to comment on specifics of what he saw.
But an official at the lab, Ken Watts, said the simulation showed how someone could hack into a utility's Internet based business management system, then into a system that controls utility operations.
Once inside, lab workers simulated cutting off the supply of oil to a turbine generating electricity and destroying the equipment.
Describing his reaction to the demonstration, Wood said: "I wished I'd had a diaper on."
Many electric industry representatives have said they are concerned about cyber security and have been taking steps to make sure their systems are protected.
But Wood and others in the industry said the companies' computer security is uneven.
"A sophisticated hacker, which is probably a group of hackers ,could probably get into each of the three U.S. North American power (networks) and could probably bring sections of it down if they knew how to do it," said Richard Clarke, a former counterterrorism chief in the Clinton and Bush administrations.
Clarke said government simulations show that electric companies have not done enough to prevent hacking.
"Every time they test, they get in," Clarke said.
"It's nice that the power companies think that they've done things, and some of them have.
But as long as there's a way to get into the grid, the grid is as weak as its weakest company."
Some industry analysts play down the threat of a massive cyber attack, saying it's more likely that terrorists would target the physical infrastructure such as power plants and transmission lines.
James Andrew Lewis, director of technology policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington D.C., said a coordinated attack on the grid would be technically difficult and would not provide as much "bang for the buck" as high profile physical attacks.
Lewis said the bigger vulnerability may be posed not by outside hackers but by insiders who are familiar with their company's computer networks.
But in recent years, terrorists have expressed interest in a range of computer targets.
Al Qaida documents from 2002 suggest cyber attacks on various targets, including the electrical grid and financial institutions, according to a translation by the IntelCenter, an Alexandria, Va., firm that studies terrorist groups.
A government advisory panel has concluded that a foreign intelligence service or a well supported terrorist group "could conduct a structured attack on the electric power grid electronically, with a high degree of anonymity, and without having to set foot in the target nation," according to a report last year by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
Cyber security specialists and government officials said that cyber attacks are a concern across many industries but that the threat to the country's power supply is among their top fears.
Hackers have gained access to U.S. utilities' electronic control systems and in a few cases have "caused an impact," said Joseph Weiss, a Cupertino, Calif. based computer security specialist with Kema Inc., a consulting firm focused on the energy industry.
He said computer viruses and worms also have caused problems.
Weiss, a leading expert in control system security, said officials of the affected companies have described the instances at private conferences that he hosts and in confidential conversations but have not reported the intrusions publicly or to federal authorities.
He said he agreed not to publicly disclose additional details and that the companies are fearful that releasing the information would hurt them financially and encourage more hacking.
Weiss said that "many utilities have not addressed control system cyber security as comprehensively as physical security or cyber security of business networks."
The vulnerability of the nation's electrical grid to computer attack has grown as power companies have transferred control of their electrical generation and distribution equipment from private, internal networks to supervisory control and data acquisition, or SCADA, systems that can be accessed through the Internet or by phone lines, according to consultants and government reports.
That technology has led to greater efficiency because it allows workers to operate equipment remotely.
Other systems that feed information into SCADA or that operate utility equipment are vulnerable and have been largely overlooked by utilities, security consultants said.
Some utilities have made hacking into their SCADA systems relatively easy by continuing to use factory set passwords that can be found in standard documentation available on the Internet, computer security consultants said.
The North American Electric Reliability Council, an industry backed organization that sets voluntary standards for power companies, is drafting wide ranging guidelines to replace more narrow, temporary precautions already on the books for guarding against a cyber attack.
But computer security specialists question whether those standards go far enough.
Officials at several power companies said they had invested heavily in new equipment and software to protect their computers.
Many would speak only in general terms, saying divulging specifics could assist hackers.
"We're very concerned about it," said Margaret E. "Lyn" McDermid, senior vice president and chief information officer for Dominion Resources Inc., a Richmond based company that operates Dominion Virginia Power and supplies electricity and natural gas in other states.
"We spend a significant amount of time and effort in making sure we are doing what we ought to do."
Executives at Constellation Energy view the constant hacking attempts which have been unsuccessful as a threat and monitor their systems closely.
They said they assume many of the hackers are the same type seen in other businesses: people who view penetrating corporate systems as fun or a challenge.
"We feel we are in pretty good shape when it comes to this," Collins said.
"That doesn't mean we're bulletproof."
The biggest threat to the grid, analysts said, may come from power companies using older equipment that is more susceptible to attack.
Those companies many not want to invest large amounts of money in new computer equipment when the machines they are using are adequately performing all their other functions.
O. Sami Saydjari, chief executive of the Wisconsin Rapids, Wis. based consulting firm Cyber Defense Agency LLC, said hackers could cause the type of blackout that knocked out electricity to about 50 million people in the Northeast, Midwest and Canada in 2003, an event attributed in part to trees interfering with power lines in Ohio.
He said that if hackers destroyed generating equipment in the process, the amount of time to restore electricity could be prolonged.
"I am absolutely confident that by design, someone could do at least as (much damage), if not worse" than what was experienced in 2003, said Saydjari, who was one of 54 prominent scientists and others who warned the Bush administration of the risk of computer attacks following Sept 11, 2001.
"It's just a matter of time before we have a serious event."
Deep inside the cave like laboratories of the legendary research center that created the atomic bomb, scientists have begun work on a Manhattan Project of a different sort.
In the wake of Sept 11, 2001, they have been constructing the most elaborate computer models of the United States ever attempted.
There are virtual cities inhabited by millions of virtual individuals who go to work, shopping centers, soccer games and anywhere else their real life counterparts go.
And there are virtual power grids, oil and gas lines, water pipelines, airplane and train systems even a virtual Internet.
The scientists build them.
And then they destroy them.
On a recent weekday at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, researcher Steve Fernandez took several power relay plants in the Pacific Northwest offline with a few clicks of his keyboard while Kristin Omberg and Brent Daniel were working up mathematical models that calculated the worst places to release biological agents in San Diego.
"We're trying to be the best terrorists we can be," said James P. Smith, who is working on simulations of a smallpox virus released in Portland, Ore.
"Sometimes we finish and we're like, 'We're glad we're not terrorists.'
" The Los Alamos experiments are part of the Homeland Security Department's efforts to harness technology to aid the war on terror.
Like government "data mining" projects that use flight itineraries, credit card reports and other data and try to find patterns to predict who might be a likely terrorist, the simulations are attempts to guess the bigger picture.
The government is using the simulations to provide options in the event of a real terrorist attack.
The information is so sensitive that most of the lab's work is classified, and the physical facility is secured with its own experimental technologies.
If the simulations got into the wrong hands, the researchers say, they could be used as the ultimate weapon against Americans.
"It would be a terrorist recipe for doing something terrible," Smith said.
Some urban planners have criticized the project for its cost each simulation can cost tens of millions of dollars and have argued that such modeling can never be precise.
A book on public health threats by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, for example, notes that some critics say simulations "cannot provide clear evidence for or against any option."
But advocates say the exercise is providing crucial information for protecting the country.
When planes crashed into the World Trade Center and Pentagon almost four years ago, the government had little understanding of the weaknesses and interdependencies of power, water, transportation and telecommunications networks.
Richard Clarke, the former counter terrorism czar under the Clinton and Bush administrations, warned that this opened the possibility of "cascade" failures domino effects that authorities had little power to stop.
In 2003, for instance, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission revealed a computer worm on the Internet penetrated the control systems of a nuclear power plant, disabling its safety mechanisms for about five hours.
That same year, much of the East Coast and Midwest were hit with an electrical blackout that experts thought should have been limited to one area.
Clarke created a "critical infrastructure protection" group made up of the top officials from the government and from industry.
The Los Alamos simulations are the cornerstone of their work.
The models have helped officials pinpoint and prioritize where changes need to be made.
Fernandez's work has led to upgraded security at certain power plants.
Omberg and Daniel have created biosensors which can detect a wide variety of biological threats that have been placed in areas of major cities that the computer program calculated were vulnerable, such as near sports arenas or transportation hubs.
Smith's findings have been a major component of the debate over whether it's necessary to synthesize enough smallpox vaccine for the entire country.
He found that in the event of an outbreak, targeted vaccination would work almost as well as mass vaccination if officials moved quickly to establish quarantine zones for those infected.
Traditionally, estimates of infection and deaths are made using a simple multiple that denotes how fast the disease spread.
Smith's program is far more detailed and uses a mixture of mathematical data and basic psychology to simulate an area and the behavior of its population.
It begins by modeling every city block using census data, then populates the city using information on household income and age of residents.
Next the scientists simulate people's movements on a daily basis by using data from diaries kept by commuters, foot traffic patterns on streets, malls and other public places, and public transportation schedules.
The hope is to see how different social interactions are in America in 2005 from other areas where the spread of disease has been studied such as in rural Africa, where communities are much more isolated, or in the United States in 1918 when some cities like Portland saw much traffic from soldiers on boats.
It turns out that the average person in Portland, population 1.6 million, has about five "activities" per day.
That is, they might get up and drop the children off at school, go to work, buy gas, buy groceries and then pick up the children.
The average travel time for each person is 30 minutes.
"The thing that makes it unique is the estimate of who comes into contact with whom in a large urban area and how long the contacts last," said Stephen Eubank, a researcher at the Bioinformatics Institute at Virginia Tech who worked with Smith on the smallpox simulation.
The scientists continuously run the simulations, which operate about 100 times faster than real time, testing actions like closing the airport, quarantining a neighborhood or shutting down workplaces.
"It's like the movie 'Groundhog Day.'
You could reach in and say what I did yesterday didn't work so well and let's see how something else works," Eubank said.
In one simulation, Smith unleashed the smallpox virus in a university building in downtown Portland, with several students becoming victims.
Soon after the 10 day incubation period passed, hospitals throughout Portland began to report cases.
Smith's computer chronicled the devastation.
Day 1: 1281 infected, zero dead.
Day 35: 23919 infected, 551 dead.
Day 70: 380582 infected, 12499 dead.
Smith wondered: How would the results change if local officials closed the schools?
If they started mass vaccination?
If they locked down the whole city?
Smith programmed a cluster of computers to run through these scenarios and hundreds of others, trying to determine which response would save the most lives.
Each time the model is run, it produces more data than the contents of the Library of Congress.
Some findings are obvious: the invention of air transportation may be the biggest factor in the spread of disease.
Others aren't as easy to guess: shutting down schools might not help as much as expected because parents are likely to take their children to malls and playgrounds where they can come in contact with others who have been infected.
It also turned out the speed of intervention is much more important than the type of intervention.
If officials waited 10 days or more, Smith found, "We didn't get to enough people so a lot of people died.
It was almost as bad as a 'do nothing' strategy, which was depressing."
Eubank said that when he runs simulations for governors or mayors, they inevitably ask him to quarantine the whole city, to make sure residents stay in their houses.
"But if I had to do that I would basically be shooting anybody who walks out on their doorstep.
That's not acceptable," Eubank said.
"We are trying to understand the 'cost benefit' trade off if you implement a quarantine it may give you the benefit you're looking for but it may be too costly socially."
The biggest challenge simulation researchers face is that it's unlikely they'll ever know how accurate they were until a real attack occurs.
The only system that's been tested against a real life event is Fernandez's program for how hurricanes will affect the electricity grid.
In September 2004, his team used the system to predict the route of Hurricane Frances based on historical information about similar hurricanes as well as its wind profile, intensity and other data 40 hours before landfall.
He advised Florida officials to position emergency repair teams in certain parts of the state he thought would receive the most damage and he turned out to be correct.
His computer was also right about the 11 days it would require to get power back up for 90 percent of the state, and about the estimate of damage: $28 billion, the final damage total was $27 billion.
Fernandez said the pinpoint accuracy of the Hurricane Frances simulation was just plain luck.
The world is too complex, he said, to be captured that specifically in a computer program.
No matter how much money is spent, he said, or how long scientists work on the task, "we'll never understand all the interdependencies of life."
The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, June 2: When the East Coast and Midwest were hit by a blackout in 2003, the first fear of many people was that terrorists had attacked the electricity grid.
It turned out not to have been terrorism, but the fears were well founded.
Experts have long warned that the nation's power, transportation and communications systems are vulnerable to "cyberattacks" that could devastate the economy and cause huge damage to life and property.
Now a new government report has concluded that far too little is being done to close these gaps.
After Sept 11, 2001, a group of leading scientists sent a stern warning to President Bush about the danger of a computer based terrorist attack on the nation's infrastructure.
They called for the creation of a major Cyber Warfare Defense Project, modeled on the Manhattan Project, to prevent, detect and respond to potential attacks.
"Fast and resolute mitigating action is needed to avoid national disaster," the scientists warned.
Power grids, water treatment and distribution systems, major dams, and oil and chemical refineries are all controlled today by networked computers.
Computers make the nation's infrastructure far more efficient, but they also make it more vulnerable.
A well planned cyberattack could black out large parts of the country, cut off water supplies or worse.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission found that in 2003 a malicious, invasive program called the Slammer worm infected the computer network at a nuclear power plant and disabled its safety monitoring system for nearly five hours.
Despite the warnings after 9/11 and again after the 2003 blackout disturbingly little has been done.
The Government Accountability Office did a rigorous review of the Department of Homeland Security's progress on every aspect of computer security, and its findings are not reassuring.
It found that the department has not yet developed assessments of the threat of a cyberattack or of how vulnerable major computer systems are to such an attack, nor has it created plans for recovering key Internet functions in case of an attack.
The report also expressed concern that many of the department's senior cybersecurity officials have left in the past year.
Rep Zoe Lofgren, the California Democrat who was among those who requested the GAO report, said last week that it proved that "a national plan to secure our cybernetworks is virtually nonexistent."
Protecting the nation from a potentially devastating cyberattack is not easy.
The technological challenges are considerable even major technology companies have trouble defending themselves against hackers.
The number of potential targets is enormous.
And because many of the targets are in private hands, the Department of Homeland Security has to work with entities that may be reluctant to follow the government's lead.
But overcoming these obstacles should be a high priority.
One of the lessons of the Sept 11 attacks in New York and Washington was how much damage a few men with simple weapons, like box cutters, could do if they targeted a point of maximum vulnerability.
In a well planned cyberattack, a single terrorist with nothing more than a computer and Internet access could do an extraordinary amount of harm from half a world away.
In a hushed, dimly lit room in Austin, Texas, and in an identical space in nearby Taylor, people responsible for keeping the lights on in Texas intently scrutinize computer monitors 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Above them hangs a bank of displays 16 feet high by 32 feet wide that silently blink with changing data impenetrable to the average person.
The workers also gaze at something more familiar: two monitors displaying The Weather Channel.
Those in the control room are employees of a quasi governmental entity called ERCOT, the Electrical Reliability Council of Texas.
ERCOT's job is to make sure the power doesn't go out in Texas.
The agency operates and maintains Texas' electric grid, which serves 85 percent of all of the state's electricity users and covers 75 percent of the state's sprawling geographic area.
As the first hot days of Texas summer count down to the scorching temperatures of late July and August, ERCOT managers say the grid is prepared.
It's ready to meet the demands of 20 million Texans, ready to deal with another peak day like that of Aug 7, 2003, when the state's electrical usage reached a record 60095 megawatts.
Most Texans knew little of the grid until August 2003, when the nation's largest power outage caused blackouts in the Northeast.
Studies of the outages indicated problems in Canada cascaded into the Northeast, leaving New York and Detroit without power for days.
Texas, residents were told, is protected from power outages outside the state because the system isn't connected to other major grids in North America.
The Texas grid covers the state except for parts of East Texas, the El Paso area and parts of the Panhandle.
"It's true the Texas grid is isolated from every other state, so what happens in other regions will have no effect on us," said Mitty Plummer, associate professor of engineering technology at the University of North Texas.
The grid consists of the biggest power transmission lines lines strung from big steel towers that carry as much as 345000 volts.
ERCOT is responsible for making sure electric generation across the state matches the load, or usage.
It's a delicate balancing act to manage the scheduling of power.
At ERCOT's control centers in Taylor a bunkerlike building designed to withstand a Force 3 tornado with winds up to 206 mph and its backup center in Austin, computer programs help workers monitor electrical generation and usage.
On a recent day at ERCOT's Austin control room, it was quiet as about half a dozen workers monitored the system.
But if there's an imbalance between power generation and usage, "things can get pretty tense and challenging," ERCOT spokeswoman Dottie Roark said.
"It takes a certain kind of person, because they can't go out to lunch or dinner.
They pretty much live here for 12 hours."
Experts in the control room closely monitor frequency the heartbeat of the system that reflects the relationship between electrical generation and usage.
At 60 hertz, generation matches usage exactly.
Second by second, 24 hours a day, control room experts strive to keep Texas' grid as close to 60 hertz as possible.
Its control room uses sophisticated computer programs that forecast demand, plan for emergencies and make adjustments.
The 60 hertz goal is just "a continual target, because every time somebody flips a light switch, it changes," said Paul Wattles, ERCOT's manager of governmental relations and communications.
There's constant communication between ERCOT and every utility that's part of the grid.
"ERCOT is digesting real time data from everybody, and they'll change generation patterns to match the load," said Bill Woolsey, assistant chief transmission operator at CPS, the electric utility in San Antonio.If there's a drastic, non routine mismatch too much usage and not enough power generation, or vice versa "it can cascade into a lot of problems," Woolsey said.
Weather patterns provide big clues to power usage.
"At ERCOT, we're obsessed about the weather," spokeswoman Roark said, because the system needs to be ready to respond to demand.
Stable as it is, the Texas grid could be threatened by a huge storm, by multiple equipment failures or by terrorism.
In a presentation last year to the Texas Legislature, ERCOT officials said the grid is prepared for emergencies regardless of cause.
"We could lose any single, major element of the system one outage caused by a tornado or sabotage and it wouldn't put us at risk," said Kent Saathoff, ERCOT's director of systems operations.
It would take a massive, coordinated, simultaneous, forced outage basically an act of war to bring down the Texas grid, a key ERCOT official has told a Texas Senate committee in response to a question about terrorism threats.
ERCOT also continually examines the grid's reserve margins of power the gap between available power and forecasted usage.
"We make sure that even if we hit a peak we have enough power to meet the demand," Roark said.

Security experts warned Tuesday that terrorists could unleash electromagnetic bombs to cripple the nation, damaging electrical systems vital to everything from financial services to transportation and communications.
They urged Congress and Homeland Security officials to craft plans to fend off such attacks and set up mechanisms to fix and restore power quickly.
"Their effects on systems and infrastructures dependent on electricity and electronics could be sufficiently ruinous as to qualify as catastrophic to the nation," said Lowell Wood, acting chairman of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack, an advisory group set up by Congress.
Experts say the United States is particularly vulnerable because it relies heavily on telecommunications and electronics.
In some scenarios, the e bomb could be used to release an electromagnetic pulse that could disable and damage electrical power systems.
An e bomb attack could "devastate this country," said Sen Jon Kyl, R Ariz., chairman, of the Judiciary subcommittee on terrorism, technology and homeland security, which conducted a hearing Tuesday on the potential threat.
"The public and the Congress need to pay more attention to this danger."
Wood cautioned that potential adversaries, including terrorists, have or can get nuclear weapons to generate the electromagnetic pulse.
Those threats come not only from terrorists but from nations with nuclear capabilities such as North Korea and Iran, the experts said.
While not a new threat (it was also a major concern during the Cold War), lawmakers and commissioners said that since the Sept 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the threat has heightened.
The commission released a report this past July.
Much of that report still has not been made public because of security concerns, commissioners said.
Some of its recommendations include the government buying backup transformers to be stored in protected shelters and crafting a plan to use diesel electric motors.
They point to the 2003 blackout as an example of the devastating impact of losing power.
Peter Fonash, acting deputy manager for the National Communications System, Department of Homeland Security, acknowledged the potential threat.
But he said the agency has conducted tests and simulations, particularly on telecommunications switches, and have "determined that there is minimal EMP effect."
But Peter Vincent Pry, a staffer on the commission, argued that the nation's telecommunications systems are vulnerable and he said that other countries have taken steps to protect against e bomb attacks "indicating that this threat has broad international credibility."
More than two dozen nuclear power plants across the United States lack sirens that would warn of a nuclear emergency if electricity also was blacked out, according to a report by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Twenty eight U.S. plants lack backup power for sirens that are supposed to alert residents in a 16 kilometer (10 mile) radius of trouble, the NRC said.
Seventeen plants have full backup for the systems, while 18 others have at least some sirens that would remain operable during an outage.
The NRC released the information Wednesday as part of its response to a coalition of 17 activist groups and elected officials that petitioned the commission in February for information about the siren systems.
"Basically, we have an inoperable emergency system at a majority of the sites," said Paul Gunter, director of the Reactor Watchdog Project for the Washington, D.C. based Nuclear Information and Resource Service.
Plants that lack any backup power for sirens include the Indian Point plant just north of New York City and the Davis Besse plant near Toledo, Ohio.
At Three Mile Island in Middletown, the site of a March 28, 1979, partial meltdown that remains the worst U.S. nuclear plant accident, only 19 of the 96 sirens would operate if power went out.
During mock terror attacks on plants, NRC officials assume electric power would be disrupted.
Working sirens would be crucial since a loss of electricity can challenge nuclear plants' safety shutdown systems and heighten the risk of a core melting accident, nuclear watchdog groups said.
The groups have asked the NRC to step in and require plant owners to provide backup power to the sirens.
The NRC said siren upgrades are in the works at about half the plants that lack warning systems that are fully backed up.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency is revising warning requirements following the massive August 2003 electrical blackout in the northeastern United States.
Todd Schneider, spokesman for Davis Besse, said the sirens are only one part of an emergency plan.
Warning messages are also spread by police car loudspeakers and radio stations.
On a day when oil and gasoline prices hit record highs, President Bush on Monday signed into law a bill that encourages increased domestic oil and gas production and the building of new nuclear power plants while creating incentives for alternative energy sources and requiring modernization of the nation's electrical grid.
At a ceremony at the Sandia National Laboratory here, Bush acknowledged that the measure would not immediately bring down the price of gasoline, but he said it would give the United States a start on reducing its dependence on foreign oil and help the economy over the long run.
The measure has been one of the White House's legislative priorities since 2001.
The final product did not contain a number of provisions backed by the administration, including one that would have opened a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.
It won support from some Democrats in Congress, but it was criticized by many others and also by environmental and consumer groups, who said it gave away too much to energy companies at a time when they were benefiting from high oil prices, which neared $64 a barrel on Monday.
The Energy Department reported Monday that the average national price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline hit $2.37 last week, a record and 49 cents a gallon above prices a year ago.
The bill he signed here touches on many aspects of energy policy.
In addition to encouraging more domestic oil and gas production, it provides money for research into technology to help burn coal with less pollution and creates federal risk insurance for companies that build a new generation of nuclear power plants.
It extends or creates tax incentives for alternative energy sources like wind, creates incentives for the use of more ethanol and finances research into the use of hydrogen to power automobiles.
The bill contains incentives for oil companies to expand refineries to reduce periodic tightness in supplies of gasoline, and tax credits for conservation and energy efficiency.
The New York City region and all of New England should have enough electric power to supply even a record demand this summer, an organization that monitors the region's power grid said Thursday.
Utility companies should not have to reduce the supply of power to businesses or residential customers unless there is an unexpected disruption or "extremely hot weather conditions," said Charles Durkin, chairman of the Northeast Power Coordinating Council, a nonprofit group whose members include utility executives and regulators.
Last summer was unusually cool and did not strain the system, he said.
But most New Yorkers remember the August 2003 blackout that kept the city in the dark for a full day, and many worry about another one.
Energy industry officials offered no guarantees that there would not be a recurrence, because that blackout was caused by a breakdown in the transmission network that started in Ohio and cascaded to New York.
They expressed confidence, though, that demand would not exceed supply anytime soon in New York state or New England.
New York should have enough power to meet the state's requirement of a cushion of 18 percent more electricity than the expected peak demand in midsummer, Durkin said.
"We're in better shape than last year," said Edward A. Schwerdt, the council's executive director.
The council projects that the maximum available supply of electricity in New York state this summer will be 39237 megawatts, which is 7000 megawatts more than expected peak demand and 8000 more than have ever been used.
For the entire Northeast, the council projected that demand would peak in the week of July 10 at 106618 megawatts, leaving a cushion of more than 9000 megawatts of capacity.
The council's outlook was similar in tone to a report issued last week by the New York Independent System Operator, which coordinates the flow of electricity in the state.
"We're in good shape for this summer," Mark S. Lynch, the president and chief executive of the system operator said in an interview Thursday.
"We feel comfortable from a supply and demand standpoint."
In addition, Lynch said, several improvements have been made to try to prevent another disaster like the blackout of 2003.
Engineers monitoring the power grid in New York now have a better view of what is happening on transmission lines in neighboring states and can respond faster to offset problems that start elsewhere.
"We think we've done just about everything we can to protect ourselves," Lynch said.
Now, he said, Congress should force all power system operators to adopt the same standards of reliability.
Lynch also expressed concern that not enough additional generation was planned.
Without more local sources of power, New York will become increasingly reliant on imported electricity and could face shortages within five years, he said.
"I don't think anybody needs to panic," he said.
"But I don't think enough is being done to create in state generation."
Global sales of Harry Potter books have surpassed 300 million, the agent for author J.K. Rowling said Tuesday.
Agent Christopher Little said the series reached the milestone following the publication of "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince," the sixth volume about the schoolboy wizard.
Potter books have now been translated into 63 languages, most recently Farsi.
"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince" shattered publishing records in the United States, selling 6.9 million copies in its first 24 hours on sale, its US publisher Scholastic said Sunday.
"Once again Harry Potter made history.
Early reports estimate that Scholastic broke all publishing records," a Scholastic statement said.
"The fact that a brilliantly written book for children just sold 6.9 million copies in the first 24 hours in the U.S. is cause for celebration, not just for Scholastic but for book lovers everywhere," said Lisa Holton, president of Scholastic Children's Book Publishing.
A second printing of the sixth volume in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series is already hitting US bookstores, the firm said.
Scholastic had printed an unprecedented 10.8 million copies the first time around, but pre release sales were so brisk it rushed a second printing, the company said.
Thousands of Harry Potter fans across Asia donned black cloaks, witches' caps and wire rimmed glasses to cheer the arrival of the latest installment in the boy wizard's adventures.
Bookstores throughout Asia and Australia opened their doors early Saturday and began handing out copies of "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince," the latest volume in J.K. Rowling's wildly popular children's series, which has sold more than 270 million copies worldwide.
The launch was coordinated to occur simultaneously in bookstores across the globe.
Hundreds of Potter fans crammed into one of central Sydney's largest bookstores to snatch up their copies of the 607 page tome.
Seventeen year old Mohammed Jalili Baleh said he couldn't wait to know what adventures awaited him inside the cover of Rowling's latest book.
He and a friend spent more than 12 hours to be the first to get their copies.
"I'm an obsessed fan," he said.
"They grip you.
When you read one sentence, you don't want to put it down."
A global phenomenon, the Harry Potter books have been translated into 62 languages and have inspired a series of films.
Rowling is now the richest woman in Britain, with a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at US$1 billion (euro830 million).
In Hong Kong, a teenage boy leaned against a wall outside a bookstore and began reading a copy immediately after buying it.
Jennifer Yip, 15, said she hates reading, but described herself as a "super fan" of Harry Potter.
"The story's really gripping, and I like the fact that the characters are falling in love and getting more mature," she said.
About 40 Potter fans gathered outside the Wangfujing Bookstore in downtown Beijing early Saturday to buy hardcover copies in English for 178 yuan (US$21, euro18) each.
It sold 200 books in the first hour and had 4000 in stock, said spokeswoman Li Minyue.
The fantasy series is hugely popular in China.
Pirated versions of the first five books in the series and the movie spin offs are widely available, but so far the latest book appears to have evaded Chinese pirates.
In Singapore, a line at a bookstore on the Orchard Road shopping belt grew throughout the morning, but dwindled to just a handful of eager readers an hour before the sale began.
"It's raining.
And because you can order it beforehand with a discount, I think many Singaporeans will take advantage of that instead," said April Lee, a marketing manager and Potter fan.
Booksellers around the world have profited enormously from the Potter phenomenon, which seems to grow with each new edition.
"Pre orders of Harry Potter six have more than doubled that of the previous Harry book," said Don Grover, the chief executive of the Dymocks Group of Companies, one of Australia's largest chain of bookstores.
"Harry Potter has done wonders for children's literacy and for introducing children to the joys of reading, which is great for children and great for the book industry."
Dymocks said it expects to sell more than 50000 copies of the latest Potter book on Saturday alone.
But the party must eventually come to an end.
"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince" is the penultimate book in Rowling's seven book series.
For Sydney resident Agnes Jang, 16, who came dressed head to toe as a student of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the end of the Potter era will be a cause to mourn.
"It'll be very sad when she finishes writing the books," Jang said.
"But Harry has to move on."
Associated Press correspondents Sylvia Hui in Hong Kong, Alexa Olesen in Beijing and En Lai Yeoh in Singapore contributed to this report.
Booksellers across French speaking Europe saw legions of Harry Potter fans scramble to their shelves this weekend, as the sixth book in the bestselling children's series went on sale in translation at midnight on Friday.
Hundreds of bookshops in France, Belgium and Switzerland stayed open past the witching hour to welcome hoards of Harry's young admirers, eager to purchase their copy of "Harry Potter et le Prince de Sang Mele" ("Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince").
Publishers Gallimard have printed a record two million French copies of the penultimate tome in British author J.K. Rowling's astronomically successful series, predicting a fresh outbreak of the "Pottermania" which has surrounded previous installments of the boy wizard's adventures.
The first five books in the series, created in 1996, have sold 300 million copies worldwide and more than 17 million copies in French translation, while 100000 French and 30000 Swiss fans have already bought the English edition, which has been out since July.
At many bookshops, sales staff in witches' hats served up devilish delicacies and magical potions as children young and old queued way past bedtime.
A thousand customers visited the Brussels store of major book and music retailer FNAC between 11:00 pm and 1:30 am (2100 to 2330 GMT) and bought over 500 books in a bewitching atmosphere of special effects and smoke.
Competitor Filigranes had opened at 9:00 pm (1900 GMT) for a reservation only evening of entertainment with quizzes, costumes and nibbles, and sold 200 copies.
Fans in costume crammed into bookseller Tropismes which saw "many more than for the last book, and more children because it was a Friday", according to store manager Brigitte De Meeus.
In France, the FNAC chain ordered a massive 30000 copies while around 15 of their stores stayed open all night, decked out with broomsticks, witches' hats, spellbooks and potions.
Its central Paris Champs Elysees branch transformed itself into a "forbidden forest" full of scary creatures, normally off limits to students of magic at Harry's "Hogwart's school" (or the "college de Poudlard" as it is known to French readers).
Twice as many copies of the latest tome have been printed compared to volume five and three times as many as volume four.
Outlets in Switzerland preferred to wait until dawn on Saturday to open their doors, but still saw a "blistering start" to sales at FNAC stores with less of a rush at competitors Payot.
"I've done nothing but stack shelves all day," one FNAC manager in Geneva said.
"We have sold 120 copies in one and a half hours."
"Lots of people will probably buy the book in both languages, as many bought it in English for the pleasure of owning it but can't actually read it," she predicted.
Publishers Gallimard had carefully stage managed the launch, distributing posters of the front cover to bookstores at the start of September and installing clocks counting down the final two weeks to publication.
The release date was also announced in newsletters handed out at school gates and printed in youth magazines.
Internet sales have also been brisk with major retailer Amazon reporting 1.5 million orders worldwide, far outstripping the month's other major French language release, Michel Houellebecq's "La Possibilite d'une Ile".
Booksellers across Portugal saw legions of Harry Potter fans flock to their shelves this weekend as the sixth book in the children's series first dreamt up when its British author lived in the country went on sale in translation at midnight on Friday.
Portuguese publishers Editorial Presenca have printed 150000 copies of the Portuguese language version of J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince", which was first published worldwide in English in July.
It is a record first print run for a Portuguese language version of the series, whose five first books have until now sold some 1.39 million copies in Portugal, a nation of just over 10 million people.
More than 500 people attended a midnight launch party for the book hosted by the publisher at the ruins of Lisbon's Gothic Carmo convent, which stands in testimony to an earthquake which leveled the city in 1755.
Many of the children who attended the event, which featured a light show and other special effects, dressed as their favourite character from J.K. Rowling's series of books about a boy wizard at a boarding school.
Several bookstores, and five post offices, in Lisbon and second city Oporto in the north opened their doors at midnight on Friday to sell the penultimate tome in the bestselling series.
State owned post office CTT said it would deliver 3500 copies of the book to homes across the country between Saturday and Monday.
The first book in the series, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" sold over 400000 copies alone in Portugal.
Rowling worked as an English teacher in Portugal in the 1990s, when she is said to have begun imagining the characters of the Harry Potter books.
Here books have sold more than 300 million copies worldwide in over 60 languages and the first three Potter books have already been made into blockbuster movies.
Three months after one of the world's best sellers, the latest Harry Potter tale was released, its Chinese edition hit local book stores on Saturday.
The fantasy series by J.K. Rowling is quite popular in China.
Although the publication of the Chinese edition of "Harry Potter: The Half Blood Prince" came out much faster than other translated versions, it was still not soon enough online editions of the book appeared only a month after the English original was launched.
According to the book's authorized publisher, People's Literature Publishing House, all the 800000 copies of the first printing of Potter VI were distributed to hundreds of Xinhua Bookstore outlets across the country's major cities.
"We have to prepare to quickly issue the Chinese edition to thwart the pirates," said Wang Ruiqin, editor of the series of the publishing company.
In order to beat pirates, the publishing house used a special kind of green paper as its cover and employed the state of the art technology.
The government vowed on August 17 to curb pirates in book market, including Potter VI.
According to the Guangming book lovers' website, the publisher launched the Chinese edition of the fifth Harry Potter book in September 2003, also just three months after the original came out in June that year.
Since first Harry Potter debut in China in 2000, the previous five book series have sold more than 7.14 million copies so far in the mainland, with the average record hitting 1.43 million.
A Canadian supermarket chain scrambled to put the magic of Harry Potter back in the box Tuesday after accidentally selling 14 copies of the much anticipated book days ahead of its scheduled worldwide launch.
The grocer accidentally stocked shelves last Thursday with "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince," the sixth book in J.K. Rowling's acclaimed series, allowing some unsuspecting customers to get a sneak peak at its contents before its scheduled worldwide release on July 16.
The grocer begged customers to return the books, but if they refused, Canadian publisher Raincoast Book Distribution Ltd. sought an unprecedented injunction from a provincial court to keep the storyline a secret.
"The situation right now is contained.
It involved a single store location and handful of customers.
Nobody in Canada has spoiled the secret," said Raincoast's Jamie Broadhurst.
He refused to say if any of the wayward books had been returned or even if the buyers had been identified.
"The process is ongoing right now.
As you can imagine, the situation is somewhat fluid," he said.
Previous instalments of the book have sold almost 300 million copies worldwide since 1997.
While those, too, were shrouded in secrecy, extreme pains were taken this time around to safeguard the storyline, because the author had previously hinted that one of the main characters would die.
Justice Kristi Gill ordered the 14 customers not to talk about the book, copy it, sell it or read it until after midnight on this upcoming Saturday.
The judge also compelled the unidentified customers to hand over the novel to Raincoast, which has agreed to return them signed by Rowling, along with other gifts, after the official launch.
Seventy lucky children from Australia, Britain, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa will mark the midnight launch of the next Harry Potter book with the boy wizard's creator J.K. Rowling.
The young group, aged eight to 16, won competitions in their home countries to attend an exclusive party at Edinburgh Castle, Scotland, which has been transformed into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to celebrate the release of "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince".
Accompanied by their parents or guardians, the fans will be driven in horse drawn carriages to the castle, where fire eaters, jugglers and torch throwers are due to be performing outside.
Some 2000 local school children are also expected to gather along the main road leading to the castle to await the arrival of Rowling, 39, who is expected to make a brief appearance shortly before witching hour strikes.
Adding to the sense of magic, a giant image of the front cover of the latest book which shows Potter and his headmaster Professor Albus Dumbledore, with wands poised, surrounded by fire will be beamed overhead.
The multi millionaire author will then enter the castle with her 70 young guests and their minders for the extravagant party, which is being thrown by Bloomsbury, the British publisher of the best selling Potter series.
At one minute past midnight on Saturday morning (2301 GMT Friday), she will read them the first chapter of the sixth and penultimate volume of her world famous series about the magical adventures of Potter and his friends.
Following this, Rowling will give each child a signed copy of the book for them to read over the weekend before she meets them again on Sunday to answer some questions.
A special television show "Harry Potter at the Castle: Magic at Midnight" on the independent British channel ITV1 will follow the events live, with images also broadcast on a giant screen outside the castle.
On Sunday, Rowling, who rarely makes public appearances, will grant her only press conference about the launch to the 70 youngsters who must then write up articles for the world's media.
In addition, a 14 year old Welsh fan, Owen Jones, is due to conduct the only one on one interview with the author, which will be broadcast that evening.
While each of the competition winners will receive an autographed copy of the new book, the Scottish National Library said it would be given the first signed version on Saturday morning.
The book will be the centrepiece of a special Harry Potter display in the front entrance of the Edinburgh building.
A drug store accidentally sold a copy of the latest Harry Potter book to a woman ahead of Saturday's strict release time, but the customer said she will return it.
Mandy Muldoon said she was shopping with her 9 year old son when she spotted a stack of the much anticipated books on a shelf and purchased one.
Christine Ekblom, a manager at the upstate New York pharmacy, said she believed it was the only copy sold.
"They were pulled off an hour after they were put on the shelves," Ekblom said.
"It was a mistake."
The book, "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince," has been shrouded in secrecy and its debut has been highly orchestrated to enable everyone readers and reviewers, alike to crack it open all at once.
It's the sixth in J.K. Rowling's seven book fantasy series on the young wizard.
Fourteen books were accidentally sold Thursday at a grocery store in Canada, but a judge ordered the customers not to talk about the book, copy it, sell it or even read it before its official release.
Muldoon's husband said the family would return the book to the publisher, though his stepson, Sylum Mastropaolo, admitted reading about two pages.
"We're going to do the right thing," Mike Muldoon said.
"We don't want to ruin it for other kids and take away from the experience of everyone reading it together."
Kyle Good, a Scholastic publishing spokeswoman, said the company was not aware of any other early sales in the United States.
The company said Sylum would get a copy Saturday along with a gift pack.
Like millions of Harry Potter fans, Katherine Moss can't wait to get her fingers on a copy of the sixth entry in J.K. Rowling's best selling series.
And for once, the 16 year old blind student won't have to wait months longer than her sighted friends to dive into "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince."
The book goes on sale at midnight Friday.
A Braille edition is due out three days later much earlier than with previous Harry Potter books, thanks to a new arrangement between the publisher, Scholastic Inc., and the National Braille Press in Boston.
Moss, a student at the Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown, doesn't want the book read aloud to her.
She wants to savor each word of the text at her own pace.
"When I read it in Braille, it takes me a lot longer," she said.
"That's a good thing.
Usually, I don't want it to end.
That's how much of a reader I am."
For the first time, Scholastic provided the National Braille Press with an advance copy of the Harry Potter book, which is kept under tight wraps.
For the past two weeks, more than four dozen employees at the Boston printing house have been working overtime to print a batch of 800 Braille copies of the "Half Blood Prince."
Tanya Holton, NBP's vice president of development, said it usually takes months, if not a year or two, for published books to make it into Braille form.
"This is the only book we have blitzed like this before, because readers are clamoring for it," Holton said.
At 1100 pages, the Braille edition is nearly twice as long as the hardcover version.
It comes in nine volumes, takes up 13 1/2 inches (34 centimeters) of shelf space and weighs about 11 pounds (5 kilograms).
Each Braille book costs $62 (euro52) to produce, but the nonprofit NBP is selling them for $17.99 (euro14.98) the same as Amazon.com, according to Holton.
A local lumber retailer donated $100000 (euro83292) to help make up the difference.
"This is not about charity.
It's about parity," Holton said.
"We're not here to make a profit.
We're here to get books in the hands of children.
A blind kid deserves the same books as a sighted child."
A blind reader's options are relatively limited, however.
Only 500 to 600 new Braille titles are published each year only about 1 percent of all books published, according to Kim Charlson, the Perkins School's library director.
"Braille is such an important skill," said Charlson, who is blind.
"Nothing compares to a kid being able to read for themselves."
Moss is still waiting for a Braille version of Katherine Paterson's "Lyddie," a 1991 book about a young girl's struggle to survive poverty in 19th century New England.
"A lot of books aren't available in Braille," she said.
"I don't like that.
I don't like that at all."
At the Perkins School, the waiting list for the new Harry Potter book already has at least two dozen names.
More than 300 people have pre ordered the book from NBP.
"It's so important for blind children to have access to the same cultural phenomena at the same time as their peers," Holton said.
As publication nears for "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince," to be unveiled to the world July 16, expect some of the usual midnight madness and at least one new twist: less Potter merchandise.
"We've got Harry Potter pens and bookmarks, and a few of those types of things.
But that's really it.
There definitely will not be as much as the last time," says Beth Bingham, a spokeswoman for the superstore chain Borders Group, Inc. "I told the staff not to sell any of it," says Gayle Shanks, owner of the Changing Hands Bookstore in Tempe, Ariz. "We failed with it last time.
It was really pricey merchandise for pretty bad stuff, to be honest."
Potter paraphernalia, from cakes to capes, was on display everywhere when J.K. Rowling's last novel, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," came out in 2003.
Candace Corlett, a partner at the consulting firm WSL Strategic Retail, Inc., had predicted that "Order of the Phoenix" would "trigger an explosion in sales of all things Harry Potter.
She now acknowledges that no such "explosion" happened.
"There seems to be a pause," Corlett says.
"I think everyone expected an explosion the last time and went overboard.
Everybody way overstocked."
The release of "Half Blood Prince," the sixth of Rowling's seven book fantasy series, should confirm that Harry Potter mania is essentially a celebration of reading, a phenomenon created by children, not marketers.
Demand for the book is higher than ever.
Scholastic, Inc., Rowling's American publisher, has announced a first printing of 10.8 million, seven times the first run of Bill Clinton's "My Life" and 4 million more than for "Order of the Phoenix."
Meanwhile, Random House's Listening Library has commissioned 635000 copies of the audio version, again read by the beloved Jim Dale.
Pre orders from Barnes & Noble, Inc., and Amazon.com have already made "Half Blood Prince" a million seller.
"We will sell about 50000 copies per hour in the first 24 hours," says Barnes & Noble CEO Steve Riggio.
"Less than 1 percent of all books sell that many in their lifetime."
The release of "Half Blood Prince" renews a kind of summer tradition, as retailers again deck out their stores and fans of all ages prepare for a late and long evening.
The books won't vary from store to store, but the parties will.
With a police permit obtained, fire dancers are expected to perform in Tempe's Changing Hands parking lot.
In New Orleans, Octavia Books has joined with other local businesses, including a toy store and a candy shop, for a neighborhood Potter adventure.
Darkness will prevail at the Book House in St. Louis, a Victorian structure with its very own dungeon, and, says owner Michelle Barron, its own ghosts.
At Brystone Children's Books, in Fort Worth, Texas, the night will belong to Hogwarts' dreaded Professor Severus Snape and his Slytherin House.
"Our concept is that the Slytherins have taken over," says Dana Harper, a book seller at Brystone's.
"We're going to dress up like Slytherin students and part of the store will be turned into Professor Snape's office.
He'll be passing out demerit slips and house points."
Rowling will read at Edinburgh Castle in Scotland just after midnight.
According to her Web site, newspapers and bookshops in six countries will choose 70 children who aspire to be journalists to attend the reading, go through the book in a special reading room at the castle and question the author during a "children's press conference" on Sunday, July 17.
Rowling's midnight appearance will be simulcast to a Barnes & Noble store in Manhattan's Union Square, where audio reader Dale is scheduled to appear on the night of July 15, Harry Potter Eve.
But at Malaprop's Bookstore, in Asheville, N.C., no one will be reading, except, of course, the people who have bought the book.
"We've found that most people just grab their books and go, and it sort of peters out," says book seller Caroline Green.
"People aren't listening.
They want to read it themselves, and at 1 a.m. everybody is really punchy."
The sixth book in the hugely successful Harry Potter series, 'Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince', is already among the best sellers on the Internet more than six months before its publication, giant US online retailer Amazon said Wednesday.
Amazon.co.uk said advancer orders for the book, written by British author J.K. Rowling, have propelled it to number one on its list of 100 best sellers.
"The fact that the book has already hit number one in our chart shows how incredibly excited customers are about the sixth Harry Potter," said an Amazon spokesman.
The fifth book in the series, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", published in June last year, received 420000 advance orders after the announcement of its publication.
British publisher Bloomsbury said Tuesday that Rowling, pregnant with her third child, had finished the latest and penultimate book in the series about the teenage wizard's adventures, and it will be published on July 16 next year.
The books have captivated millions of children and adults and spawned a multi million dollar film, merchandising and publication industry.
The sixth book in the hugely successful Harry Potter series, 'Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince', will be published on July 16 next year, its publisher said Tuesday.
British publisher Bloomsbury said J.K. Rowling had finished the latest and penultimate book in the series about the teenage wizard's adventures that has captivated millions of childrens and adult and spawned a multi million dollar film, merchandising and pulication industry.
In a joint statement with US counterpart Scholastic, it said the next Harry Potter novel would be published simultaneously in Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States.
"We are delighted to announce the publication date," said Bloomsbury chief executive Nigel Newton and Scholastic president Barbara Marcus.
"J. K. Rowling has written a brilliant story that will dazzle her fans in a marvellous book that takes the series to yet greater heights.
"'Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince' delivers all the excitement and wonder of her best selling Harry Potter novels," they added.
The fifth book in the series, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," sold 1.8 million copies in Britain on the first day of its release, a British record.
The magical exploits of Harry and his wizard school chums, and their struggle against evil Lord Voldemort, have sold some 250 million copies worldwide in over 50 languages.
Rowling's first three Potter books have spawned three blockbuster spin off films and a huge array of merchandise.
A fourth movie, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire", is due for release in November 2005.
The vast sums of money earned from her creation have pushed Rowling into joint 552nd on the list of the planet's richest inhabitants with an estimated net worth of just over one billion dollars, according to the latest annual Forbes billionaire list.
"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince" takes up the story of the young wizard's sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Rowling, 39, is married with three children.
You already know a new Harry Potter book is coming this summer.
Here are some bells and whistles.
First, expect enough books out there to fill all of Hogwarts.
Scholastic Inc., the U.S. publisher of J.K. Rowling's fantasy series, has announced a first printing of 10.8 million copies of "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince," the largest such printing for a hardcover release in this country.
The previous record holder was "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," which came out in 2003 with a first run of 6.8 million.
"We have worked very closely with all of our accounts to anticipate the level of demand for Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,'" Scholastic Children's Books president Barbara Marcus said Wednesday in a statement.
"Once again, we are hearing from our accounts that the pre orders are phenomenal."
"Half Blood Prince" has topped the best seller lists of Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.com ever since its release was announced in December.
To make sure that nobody could miss the book's arrival, Scholastic also announced Wednesday a range of marketing gimmicks, including a Harry Potter crossword puzzle in The New York Times in July, promotional spots on the Times Square billboard, Google ads and video commercials on domestic flights of Continental Airlines and American Airlines.
Bookstores already are planning their traditional parties to mark the midnight, July 16 publication of "Half Blood Prince," the sixth of seven planned books.
Worldwide sales have topped 250 million for the fantasy series, which has been translated into 62 languages.
The latest installment in the Harry Potter series won't hit stores for more than six months but it has already topped at least one bookseller's most wanted list and is racking up thousands of advance orders, retailers said Wednesday.
Less than 24 hours after publishers announced a July 16 release date for "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince" British author J.K. Rowling's sixth novel set in the halls of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry it had shot to No. 1 on online bookseller amazon.co.uk's Hot 100 book list.
The list, calculated from all orders placed by customers on the retailer's Internet site, put the latest chapter in the boy wizard fantasy series ahead of best sellers such as Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code."
Amazon could not say exactly how many pre orders it had gotten, but the company said its Web site had been deluged after it began taking orders for the novel late Tuesday.
"The fact that the book has already hit No. 1 in our Hot 100 books chart shows how incredibly excited customers are about the sixth Harry Potter," amazon.co.uk managing director Robin Terrell said.
Amazon said it took 420000 pre orders for the fifth in the series, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," released in the summer of 2003, making it the largest ever pre order item.
The company was expecting a similar response for the latest installment.
Jo Marino, a spokeswoman for Waterstones bookstore chain, said customers had started calling its stores to place orders for the book immediately after publishers announced the release date Tuesday.
"There is so much demand people want to make sure they get their copy," Marino said.
She predicted plenty of readers would also wait until books hit the stores at 12:01 a.m. (0001 GMT) on July 16 to join in store parties and pick up their copy in person.
"Without a doubt, I think we will be seeing queues around the block like we have for the previous books," she said.
"People want to come down and be part of it."
She said when the last Potter book went on sale, Waterstones' central London store started selling it just after midnight and had sold 2000 copies within two hours.
"We think we will have the same sort of response," Marino said.
Publishers have said the new book takes up the story of Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts when the powers of the villain Voldemort and his followers are increasing day by day.
A seventh and final novel will follow at a date yet to be announced.
One month before the release of the sixth volume in J.K. Rowling's hugely successful Harry Potter series, online retailer Amazon.com said Wednesday that advance orders had topped the half million mark.
A total of 568000 copies of "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince" have been ordered online and at US syndicated store sites, such as Borders.com, Amazon said in a statement.
The online retailer has posted a "Harry Potter Meter" on its website which updates the number of advance orders every hour.
Scholastic Inc., the US publisher of the Harry Potter books has announced a record breaking first print run of 10.8 million copies for "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince" which will go on sale in the United States at midnight on July 16.
An accompanying audiobook will be available the same day with a record first printing of 635000 copies.
Harry's last outing, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," became the fastest selling book in US publishing history, selling five million copies in the first 24 hours after its release in June, 2003.
"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince" has sat firmly atop the bestseller lists of Amazon.com and BarnesandNoble.com since its release date was announced back in December.
After two years, Chinese Harry Potter fans will resume the adventures in the long awaited sixth Harry Potter book together with readers worldwide.
China International Book Trading Corporation (CIBTC) will release Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, by British author J.K. Rowling, on the international release date July 16 this year.
"The Harry Potter books will be sold at Xinhua bookstores across the country," said Jiang Tao, import center manager of CIBTC Wednesday.
According to Jiang, there will be four editions of the new Harry Potter book, UK and US children's editions and adult editions.
"The edition we will import is UK's children's edition," Jiang said.
He explained that there are no major differences in these editions but since the story is set in Britain, the company has decided to import the UK's edition.
The upcoming release will be the second time that CIBTC cooperated with Harry Potter's official publisher Bloomsbury.
In 2003, CIBTC released the fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in China, which sold more than half a million copies.
Jiang said that the number of imported copies of the sixth Harry Potter book and the price are still uncertain.
"In view of the popularity of Harry Potter around the world, sales of the English version of the book is certainly full of prospects," Jiang said.
Four days remain until the release of the sixth Harry Potter book, but it already has shattered at least one publishing record, experts said Monday.
Leading booksellers Barnes & Noble Inc., Borders Group and Amazon.com each reported that pre orders for "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince" had outstripped those for its predecessor "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," or any other book they have sold.
"Order of the Phoenix" was the fastest selling in history, with 5 million copies purchased in 24 hours on June 21, 2003.
Barnes & Noble executives said more than one million copies of the latest tale about the bespectacled boy wizard had been reserved at its 660 stores and Web site.
Amazon had received 850101 orders to its U.S. site as of 5:45 p.m. Monday, including those placed on bordersgroup.com.
A Borders spokeswoman, while declining to provide details of orders from stores, said "Half Blood Prince" had more reserved copies than any other hardcover book.
"Harry Potter is definitely a phenomenon," said Laura Porco, Amazon's group merchandising manager for books.
"We are prepared for this because we've been through it before," she said, adding that the retailer's best selling products are the fourth, fifth and now sixth book in the Potter series.
Worldwide, Amazon has received about 1.2 million pre orders for "Half Blood Prince."
At Amazon's five warehouses across the nation, workers were preparing the book for shipment under tight security.
They must present identification to enter the fenced in area where copies are kept under 24 hour guard.
No other products sold by Amazon require such measures, Porco said.
Looking at Amazon's procedures to ensure the latest Potter book doesn't get out before its 12:01 a.m. Saturday release date, U.S. Postal Service spokesman Gus Ruiz said, "The Homeland Security Department could learn something from this."
Ruiz also said the Post Office had taken corrective actions after a 2003 mishap resulted in a few copies of "Order of the Phoenix" being delivered to homes in advance of the official release.
Still, security was breached last week in British Columbia, Canada, when a bookstore sold up to 15 copies of "Half Blood Prince."
The Canadian publisher, Raincoast Books, has secured a court injunction barring anyone from leaking the plot and is offering bookplates signed by author J.K. Rowling to people who return copies.
At Scholastic Corp., the U.S. publisher, executives are tracking the pre order activity to determine the need for additional copies, the first printing totaled 10.8 million, up from 6.8 million for "Order of the Phoenix."
Spokeswoman Kyle Good said, "We are continuing to monitor what's happening with sales in order to decide on a second print run."
Barnes & Noble chief executive Steve Riggio noted that the retailer's warehouses were working around the clock to fill the pre orders.
He said, " 'Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince' is outselling the summer's blockbuster movies and it hasn't even landed on shelves yet."
British police said they arrested two men Friday in connection with the theft of the next instalment of the adventures of boy wizard Harry Potter, six weeks before its launch.
Police made the arrests after receiving reports of gunfire in the English city of Kettering where a journalist from the Sun newspaper reported he had met two men allegedly preparing to sell stolen copies of the new book.
"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince," to be published July 16, has sparked massive interest, with bookmakers offering bets since author JK Rowling announced nine months ago that a character in the series would be killed off.
Spokesmen for the Sun as well as the Daily Mirror newspaper said both had been contacted by someone claiming to have copies of the new book.
Both newspapers said they planned to meet the man in Kettering to make sure that the books were returned to the publishers.
The Sun reported it had actually met two men in the case.
A Northamptonshire Police spokesman said they arrested two men after being contacted about the book.
"Two books were recovered and they are currently being held in secure circumstances as evidence," said a spokesman.
Police said later that the two men arrested had both been charged with weapons offenses and with handling the stolen books, though they did not confirm Sun reports that shots were fired.
Both were released on police bail until early next week when they will appear before magistrates in Northamptonshire.
A police spokesman said: "We have charged a 37 year old Kettering man with possession of an offensive weapon and with handling stolen property and a 19 year old with theft and possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence."
"Both have been released on bail," the spokesman said.
Law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain issued a statement saying its client Rowling had won a court battle to stop the two men leaking details of her latest book after they were accused of attempting to sell copies of it.
Rowling is inviting 70 children from English speaking nations to join her at Edinburgh Castle July 16 to launch her new book "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince," the sixth in the series.
About 250 million Harry Potter books have been sold around the world, and "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" became one of the fastest selling books in publishing history in 2003.
The sixth novel in J.K. Rowling's blockbuster Harry Potter series, "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince," will go on sale in several countries on July 16, publishers said Tuesday.
The book will be published in Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa on the same day, said the joint announcement by Nigel Newton, the chief executive of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc in England, and Barbara Marcus, the president of Scholastic Children's Books in the United States.
"We are delighted to announce the publication date," they said.
"J.K. Rowling has written a brilliant story that will dazzle her fans in a marvelous book that takes the series to yet greater heights.
'Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince' delivers all the excitement and wonder of her best selling Harry Potter novels."
The announcement not only pleased the British author's millions of followers, it also delighted the British stock exchange.
Bloomsbury shares surged 7 percent to a new all time high of 2.94 pounds (US$5.69, euro4.25).
Sales of Harry Potter titles have provided the company with a significant boost in the past, although in September it said the absence of a new Rowling release this year had held back its annual rise in profits to 4.5 percent at 3.7 million pounds (US$7.16 million' euro5.35 million).
The new book, the publishers said, takes up the story of Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry when the powers of the villain Voldemort and his followers are increasing day by day, in the midst of a battle between good and evil.
"The author has already said that the Half Blood Prince is neither Harry nor Voldemort.
Intriguingly, the opening chapter of 'Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince' has been brewing in J.K. Rowling's mind for 13 years," the statement said.
In an earlier message on her Web site, Rowling wrote: "I know you all expected this to happen on Christmas Day, but I was sure that those of you who celebrate Christmas have better things to do on the day itself than fight your way into my study, whereas those of you who DON'T celebrate Christmas would definitely prefer not to wait until the 25th."
Rowling, 39, noted that while she is pregnant with her third child, she has had the time "needed to tinker with the manuscript to my satisfaction and I am as happy as I have ever been with the end result.
I only hope you feel it was worth the wait when you finally read it."
The 2005 publishing date means that fans will be spared the three year wait between Potter IV, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," and Potter V, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," which came out in summer 2003.
The publishers' statement and Rowling's Web site did not say whether the new book's length would top the industrial sized 870 pages of "Order of the Phoenix."
As the London stock market indicated, the new book should be great news for booksellers, who have endured another year of slow sales.
More than 100 million copies of the fantasy series, which debuted in 1997, are in print, and "Order of the Phoenix" sold an astonishing 5 million copies within 24 hours of publication.
Sales have remained phenomenal even as Rowling's books have grown longer and darker, reflecting the boy wizard's development into adolescence.
The first three Potter books have been made into hit movies.
The books also have inspired countless Potter paraphernalia, including candy, cakes, capes and toys.
Rowling has said that one of her characters will not survive her sixth book, but she refused to identify which one.
Potter himself is safe, at least for now.
Rowling has said her teenage hero will survive until the seventh and final book in the series, but has refused to say whether he will reach adulthood.

These have not been the best of times for Alan Keyes, the perennial presidential hopeful who is now the GOP candidate for the Senate in Illinois.
The most recent poll by the Chicago Tribune shows him trailing Democrat Barack Obama by an incredible 51 percentage points.
National Republicans have kept their distance, particularly since Keyes disparaged Vice President Dick Cheney's daughter.
Now it seems even the Illinois GOP is cutting Keyes loose.
The Tribune reports that he was left off a state party mailer "Your 2004 Republican Team" listing every candidate from President Bush to the state legislature.
The state party spokesman said no snub was intended because "the Keyes campaign is doing its own thing."
Barack Obama drove to Milwaukee the other day and stirred up a crowd on behalf of Russell D. Feingold, a 12 year veteran of the U.S. Senate.
Another day, he sent $25000 to South Dakota, where Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader, is fighting to keep his seat.
Obama, a mere state senator from the South Side of Chicago, is running against Alan Keyes, a Republican who is trailing him in one poll by 47 percentage points.
His campaign has raised more than $14 million and has given $400000 to various Democratic races.
Just months ago, Obama was seen as a long shot even for the Democratic nomination to run for the Senate seat being vacated by Peter G. Fitzgerald, a Republican.
But Obama won the primary in March, and then Jack Ryan, Obama's original Republican opponent, dropped out amid allegations that he had pressured his former wife, the actress Jeri Ryan, to go to sex clubs.
Then, Obama delivered a rousing keynote address at the Democratic National Convention and, in 20 minutes, his rising star was ascendant.
If elected, Obama is likely to get more attention and scrutiny and to demand more prestigious assignments than another freshman senator might.
He would become the only black person in the Senate, and only the third since Reconstruction.
Obama said he is aware of the risks of fame and raised hopes.
"I'm mistrustful of our celebrity culture," he said in an interview.
"I think it's fickle.
What's lasting is the work."
Republican Pete Coors has dumped another $500000 of his own money into his U.S. Senate campaign, bringing the total infusion of his personal cash in the general election to over $1 million.
As a result, Coors becomes the first Colorado Senate candidate to meet the threshold for the so called millionaire amendment under federal campaign finance laws.
This may allow his opponent, Attorney General Ken Salazar, to raise three times the individual contribution limit of $2000.
Coors, who had $630000 left last week, said he wanted the extra money to defend himself against attack ads recently aired by independent political committees.
Salazar, who has $436000 remaining, called Coors' actions "desperate."
With just over a week before Election Day, it may be too late for a financial windfall to be turned into a significant advantage for either campaign, observers said.
"There are only nine days left so it's hard to know if this will really make a difference for either candidate," said Jennifer Duffy of the Cook Political Report.
The Senate race is already the most expensive in state history.
The millionaire amendment, passed in 2002, was intended to level the financial playing field for candidates taking on wealthy opponents.
Perhaps the most glaring example of a candidate using the millionaire amendment was Barack Obama, an Illinois Democrat running for the U.S. Senate this year.
After his opponent, Blair Hull, dumped roughly $29 million into the primary race, Obama was allowed to collect $12000 from each individual donor.
Salazar, however, raised $1.2 million more than Coors before the beer executive's last self contribution, so it is unclear whether the Federal Election Commission will allow Salazar to increase his contribution limit.
"The formula we use takes into consideration the money the other candidate has and their ability to raise money," said FEC spokesman Ian Striton last week, when discussing the amendment generally.
Jim Carpenter, Salazar's campaign manager, said lawyers had advised the campaign otherwise.
In fact, part of the formula takes into account the funds Salazar had through Dec 31 of last year, which were zero.
Either way, Salazar's campaign must show the FEC it can raise more money from individual donors who have maxed out.
Coors, a brewery executive, appears to be the fourth Senate candidate nationally who has at least reached the threshold of the amendment, Duffy said.
As a fatherless young boy, he was caught between cultures and shuttled between relatives, but the mature Barack Obama appears to lead a charmed life.
A relatively obscure Senate hopeeal on November 2.
If he carries the day, Obama will become the only black Senator in Washington and only the third black Senator in 150 years, thanks not just to his considerable oratorical skills, but a solid legislative record and some impressive academic credentials.
"The skinny kid with the funny name," as Obama has described himself, grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia, the son of a Kenyan father and a Midwestern mother from Kansas, the white daughter of a farmer and driller.
The marriage did not last and Obama's mother remarried and took her young son to live with a second husband in Indonesia for several years.
After high school, Obama attended Columbia University and Harvard Law School and later became the first black American president of the influential Harvard Law Review.
In between times, he was a community organiser in Harlem and on Chicago's South Side, reputedly two of the nation's toughest black communities, and after a stint working as a civil rights lawyer, he plunged into local politics.
When it became clear that a seat in the US Senate from Illinois seat would be up for grabs in November, Obama, then a three term state senator jumped into the race.
In style and substance, the aspiring senator contrasts with some other high profile black political figures, such as the Reverend Al Sharpton, or one time presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson, according to one Chicago political commentator.
"He didn't get his start through the church, and he isn't dependent solely on the black community for his support," said Kenneth Janda, a political science professor at Chicago's Northwestern University.
His rhetoric is inclusive, and he has a lot of support among white liberals and white middle class voters in suburban Chicago, as well as blacks on the city's South Side.
"There is not a black America, and a white America, a Latino America, and Asian America we are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America," Obama told the Democratic Convention.
Democratic rising star Barack Obama Tuesday became the lone African American Senator, beating ultra conservative talk show host Alan Keyes in a landslide in Illinois.
Television networks projected that Obama, 43, had soundly defeated Keyes in the contest to replace a retiring one term Republican by some 70 percentage points, snagging a seat for the Democrats in the narrowly Republican controlled Senate.
The charismatic Obama, the son of a Kenyan father and American mother, was a relatively obscure Senate hopeful just a few months ago but he catapulted to prominence after giving an electrifying keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention in July.
He was one of a handful of blacks running for US Senate seats this year, including his rival Keyes, but was considered the only African American candidate with a realistic chance of winning.
Obama becomes only the third black Senator in 150 years.
The last African American to serve in the US Senate was Democrat Carole Moseley Braun, also of Illinois, who was defeated in 1998 by Fitzgerald after a single scandal plagued term.
"The skinny kid with the funny name," as Obama has described himself, grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia.
In the weeks since his much lauded convention speech, Obama came to have such star power that he was recruited to travel to more than a dozen states to stump for Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, as well as fellow congressional candidates.
"Barack Obama's importance to our party and our effort to recapture the United States Senate simply cannot be overstated," said Brad Woodhouse, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
Obama is widely touted for a future leadership position in his party possibly even a US presidential candidate.
When it became clear that a seat in the US Senate from Illinois seat would be up for grabs in November, Obama, then a three term state senator jumped into the race.
His rhetoric stresses inclusiveness, and he has a lot of support among white liberals and white middle class voters in suburban Chicago, as well as blacks on the city's South Side.
"There is not a black America, and a white America, a Latino America, and Asian America we are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America," Obama told the Democratic Convention.
Republicans' Illinois Senate hopes unraveled this year when candidate Jack Ryan withdrew over a sex scandal stemming from the release of steamy court records from a contentious divorce.
The Republicans then reached several states away to recruit Keyes, a conservative radio talk show host from the east coast state of Maryland to be their standard bearer, but he was resoundingly rejected by voters.
In the days since he was elected to the U.S. Senate, Barack Obama has chatted by phone with President George W. Bush, had his picture in People magazine and appeared several times on national television.
He's also been quizzed by the likes of 17 year old Abby Longbottom, who joined her senator elect in the stuffy basement of the Rockford Public Library to hear him talk about after school programs.
Such is the life of the United States' only black senator, who comes to Washington wearing the label of the Democratic Party's great hope but promising only to work for the folks back home.
"I have not taken the hype too seriously," Obama said after bidding farewell to his colleagues in the Illinois Legislature last week.
"When you've worked in relative obscurity for a long period of time, I think you make a decision that you're in this to actually get something accomplished, as opposed to seeking out the limelight."
The limelight, though, continues to seek out Obama, who became a political star after a rousing keynote address at the Democratic National Convention.
Before that speech, he was a relative unknown, a state senator from Chicago who had come out on top of a primary field of seven Democrats competing for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Republican Sen Peter Fitzgerald.
Obama skated through what could have been a tough race when the millionaire Republican primary winner dropped out amid a sex scandal.
Then John Kerry's campaign picked him for the convention keynote, and the rest was history for the 43 year old Harvard Law School graduate and self proclaimed "skinny kid with a funny name."
Obama's autographs now fetch bids on eBay and Internet sites offer "Obama '08 President" bumper stickers.
Obama, the son of a Kenyan father and American mother, was born in Hawaii.
He barely knew his father, also named Barack, who left to attend Harvard when his son was 2.
Obama's parents divorced and his father returned to Africa, where he worked as a senior economist for the government before he died in a car accident.
His mother remarried and moved the family to Indonesia.
At about age 10, Obama returned to Hawaii, where his grandparents helped raise him.
Although Obama has appeared on political television talk shows and sifted through 100 interview requests, most of his time since the Nov 2 election has been spent outside the national spotlight.
He traveled across Illinois and packed in crowds at library conference rooms and city hall chambers, where people wanted to know what he would do for their schools or businesses or local bus service.
In Rockford, a manufacturing town about 145 kilometers (90 miles) northwest of Chicago, Obama promised to work to close tax loopholes for businesses that move overseas and encourage passenger service to return to the local airport.
And he admitted how hard it would be to pass many of his broader initiatives such as health insurance for all children as a new senator in the minority party.
Still, his broad appeal was evident even at those local meetings.
Deki Fox traveled 1 1/2 hours from Milwaukee to Rockford just to tell Obama how much she liked him, even if he wasn't her senator.
"With all this talk of mandates, you have my mandate and the mandate of people way beyond Rockford or even the state of Illinois," Fox said.
"We are people who are divided as a country, and we need your presence ,to bring our states back together and to bring us back together as an American people."
"That's a pretty big job you just gave me," Obama said, prompting laughter from the library crowd.
Someone shouted back, "You can do it!"
When pressed, Obama acknowledges that all the attention is likely to give him more influence than a typical rookie in Congress, but he seems well aware of the perils of his star status.
He calls the presidential talk "silly" and says his first weeks in Washington will be spent finding the bathrooms and learning the ropes.
If he's going to meet the expectations many have for his political future, Obama is right to ignore the hubbub, said Bruce Ransom, a political science professor at Clemson University.
"Though others may be pushing him into celebrity status, he has to demonstrate to the voters of Illinois as well as to his colleagues in the Senate that he is not a prima donna," Ransom said.
"He's the new kid on the block, and he could be eaten alive if he's not careful."
Associated Press writer Christopher Wills in Springfield contributed to this report.
Earlier this year, Starlet Travis voted Republican in the U.S. Senate race here.
But come November, she's casting her vote for a Democratic state senator, though she disagrees with the politician's stance on some social issues.
After Travis watched Barack Obama speak at a fundraiser here a few days ago, she rushed to meet him.
"You're the only person in this race that we trust," she told Obama, as she gave him a photograph to sign.
"You aren't talking like a crazy man."
With a tired smile and dark circles under his eyes, Obama hugged Travis and signed the photograph.
That scene is playing out all across Illinois as this race makes history: It's the first time in a U.S. Senate race that the candidates from the two major parties are black.
The fight to fill Republican Sen Patrick G. Fitzgerald's open seat will give the Senate its third back member since Reconstruction.
While no one says the race is close, it is nevertheless one of the highly watched political contests this season.
On one side is a Harvard educated attorney and long time Illinois resident who practiced civil rights law.
Obama, whose father was from Kenya and mother was from Kansas, rose to national prominence after delivering a keynote address at the Democratic National Convention this July.
Former National Basketball Association star Charles Barkley stopped by Obama's office this week to say hello and Annie Leibowitz, the celebrity photographer, spent a day with the Obama family for Vanity Fair magazine.
In the past year, he has raised $14 million in campaign funds.
He diverted $250000 to support the party organizations in battleground states and helped raise $260000 for Senate candidates in 13 states.
On the other side sits Alan Keyes, who earned a bachelor's degree and doctorate in government at Harvard.
The former State Department official was an ambassador to the U.N. Economic and Social Council during the Reagan administration.
The Maryland resident has previously criticized politicians such as Hillary Rodham Clinton for running for office outside their home state.
Keyes, who also has worked as a cable TV talk show host, jumped into the race in August.
A poll conducted last week by the Pantagraph newspaper and WEEK TV show that Obama holds a 45 percentage point lead over his rival.
But Obama is not taking anything for granted.
"We've worked hard, we've had wonderful support from voters and we have Alan Keyes," said Obama, 43, at a rally last weekend in Decatur, Ill.
"I think the situation speaks for itself."
Illinois Republicans had found themselves without a candidate in August after Jack Ryan dropped out because divorce records alleged he tried to force his wife to visit sex clubs.
The state party approached two former Illinois governors, two state senators and former Bears coach Mike Ditka.
All declined to run against Obama.
The party then turned to Keyes, who said yes.
He qualified for the ballot by renting an apartment in the working class Chicago suburb of Calumet City.
Republican officials had hoped that Keyes' ethnicity, Harvard education and conservative views would be competitive against Obama.
Keyes opposes abortion, gay marriage, affirmative action and gun control.
Those views put him in stark contrast to Obama, who supports affirmative action, abortion rights and has voted in favor of background checks on all gun sales.
The candidates held their first debate Tuesday night on the radio, battling subjects including the Iraq war and improving the economy.
The two were a contrast in style.
Obama was calm and analytical, breaking down the problems and carefully choosing his words.
"I have spoken of eliminating tax breaks that have been given to companies that send opportunities overseas," Obama said.
Keyes was the eloquent orator: "One of the problems we face is shrinking our manufacturing and industrial base," Keyes said.
"If we had preserved those jobs, we wouldn't have these problems."
In recent weeks, Keyes' political strategy has been one of extreme sound bites and outrageous quotes.
Keyes said that his rival wrongly "claims an African American heritage" because his mother was white.
He has compared the state's political leaders to despots and described Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley as a "troll."
He called homosexuals, including Vice President Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter, "selfish hedonists."
In fact, say political experts, Keyes himself and what he'll say next has become one of the race's leading issues.
"Keyes has alienated almost every constituency in this state," said Paul Green, a political scientist at Roosevelt University in Chicago.
Officials with the state Republican Party don't have much to say about Keyes and the Senate race.
"We're focused on the presidential race right now," said Jason Gerwig, communications director for the state Republican Party.
Despite his low standings in the polls, Keyes has campaigned throughout the state.
He is attracting crowds that range from a few dozen to a few hundred.
On Sunday, he strolled along the streets of Marengo at the city's annual Settler's Day parade.
Keyes grinned at cheering spectators.
Afterward, he joined a couple hundred supporters to grill bratwursts, munch chips and talk politics.
"We're trying to reach every part of the state," Keyes said.
"Especially places like Marengo where there is common sense and a sense of decency and moral values."
Clarence Dillance, a shop owner who came to meet Keyes, said the event cemented his vote.
"I'm proud to be a Republican, and I want to vote for Mr Keyes," Dillance said.
"I really believe in what he says."
But Keyes' has not been well received by blacks, said Robert Starks, director of the Harold Washington Institute at the Center for Inner City Studies at Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago.
A poll conducted last month by the St. Louis Post Dispatch and KMOV TV showed that only 2 percent of Illinois' black voters are supporting Keyes.
At first, black voters say they found themselves flummoxed: If both men are black, which candidate should they support?
"But then, we started to hear what both candidates were saying and how they were saying it," said Cecelia Hardnett, 61, a state contractor who attended the Democratic rally in Decatur.
"I think the Republicans misjudged how we would react."
(Optional add end) Hardnett stopped speaking as Obama and a cluster of reporters including a writer from Vogue magazine walked through the door.
As Obama stepped on stage, the audience clung to his words.
He chuckled about his big ears and having a name no one can pronounce.
He reminisced about church and faith, and proclaimed that having a Republican in the White House had led to "our values being under siege."
Afterward, Hardnett stepped in line to meet Obama.
Nearly everyone held a pen, waiting for an autograph.
In US senate race, AIDS ravaged Ken Indonesia for the better part of his life," recalled Obama's uncle, Saidi Obama.
Forty two year old Obama, a dapper legal scholar, also returned to Nyang'oma village in the early 1990s to research his autobiography.
"There is even a plan to name Kolego Secondary School after Barack's name," said Saidi, standing outside a mosque in the town of Siaya.
"I will pray for him, just like everybody here is doing.
We believe that he is our salvation," he added.
In the Siaya district village of Nyang'oma, where Sarah lives, everybody claims some form of relationship with Obama.
Mary Akinyi, a widowed mother of three, and some of her friends singled out problems they would present to Obama if he wins and returns home for a visit.
"If Barack Obama wins, our problems are over," predicted Akinyi, adding that poverty and disease, particularly AIDS, had reduced several families to destitution.
"A lot of people have died of AIDS and we need help.
If Obama can help, okay," Akinyi added.
"Everybody believes that Obama is going to win.
I can tell you honestly that I had a dream that he will win overwhelmingly," barefooted Maria Oloo added in the local language, Dholuo.
Oloo, in her 70s, also believes that she will be condemned to a permanent pauper's life if Obama fails to haul her and her household from grinding poverty.
Sarah Obama is herself reluctant to speak about AIDS, for reasons she does not disclose, but knows Obama will at some time step in.
"Obama is generous, just like his father.
He can't stand by and see other people suffering," she said.
"But for now, they (people with AIDS) will die," Sarah added with a sigh.
John Ochieng, a flamboyant taxi driver in the nearby the city of Kisumu, which lies on the banks of Lake Victoria, said Obama would take Africa to the top of the US agenda.
"He is a democrat, bright like (former US president Bill) Clinton, articulate like Martin Luther King and good looking like (fil If he is elected, Obama would be the only African American in the US Senate and just the third to hold a seat there since the Reconstruction era after the Civil War of 1861 65.
Hussein Obama went to study in the United States in the early 1960s after he benefitted from former US president John F. Kennedy's programme that offered scholarships to students from developing nations that were emerging from colonialism.
In the space of six weeks, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Alan Keyes has branded his Democratic opponent an "academic socialist" and said Jesus would not vote for him.
He has likened the Illinois political machine to Third World despotism.
He has said homosexuals, including Vice President Cheney's daughter, Mary, are "selfish hedonists."
"What was I supposed to say, 'No, she's the vice president's daughter, she's exempt?'
" Keyes asked one day recently aboard his campaign mobile home, rolling south on Interstate 55 to a rally here.
Keyes, itinerant apostle of conservatism, lost two U.S. Senate races in Maryland and finished far out of the money in two Republican campaigns for the presidency.
He is now on his way to losing the Illinois battle for the Senate by 45 percentage points, if recent polls are borne out.
Overtaking his opponent, Democratic meteor Barack Obama, was always an impossibility, but Keyes has polarized even the Republicans.
To his own great delight.
Keyes has exposed and critics contend he has deepened a rift among Illinois Republicans.
When they have won statewide office, they have won with candidates who espoused more moderate social and political values than those beloved by Keyes and his followers.
"I'm a Republican, but it's the worst thing that could happen to Republicans," said Ron Pierce, a locksmith attending a dinner of the McHenry County Friends of NRA.
The welcome for Keyes was mixed polite, scattered applause and no cheers as he began to work the tables.
To some in this group, Keyes's candidacy is a sideshow that only highlighted the party's futility.
Several said he has devoted too much time to the wrong issues.
"He's for the Second Amendment and against abortion.
That's all well and good, but he's not from Illinois, so he shouldn't even be here," said Richard Beebe, who owns a heating and air conditioning business.
"He doesn't have a chance."
Keyes, 53, jumped into the race in August when the Illinois Republican Party found itself without a likely candidate.
The previous Republican contender, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race after his ex wife said he had tried to pressure her into having sex at clubs in front of others.
The state GOP found few others willing to challenge the charismatic Obama and his $10 million war chest.
They checked with local political luminaries and had a short dance with former Chicago Bears coach and twinkle eyed tough guy Mike Ditka, to no avail.
Enter Keyes.
Sharp tongued and like Obama Harvard educated, he had many titles.
He is a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, a former assistant secretary of state, former president of Alabama A&M University and former talk show host.
When he was recruited for the campaign, he was a freelancer in several fields, working to make a living as a lecturer and writer while training for a marathon.
The state of Maryland had placed a $7481.99 lien on his Gaithersburg home for an unpaid 1997 income tax claim.
Keyes had never lived in Illinois, but he liked the campaign idea not least because Obama would be his opponent.
Keyes and Obama are African Americans, ensuring the Senate its third popularly elected black senator in history.
Putting together a campaign organization with the help of a few Washington hands and a loyal band of aides drawn to his stern moral code and a familiar spirit of insurgency, Keyes found an apartment in Calumet City and ditched the running clothes in favor of business suits.
He has no money to spend on television ads and he has no realistic hope of defeating Obama, but that does not mean he cannot summon a prayer.
During a two day swing from Rockford to Union, Lincoln, Bloomington and Springfield, Christianity figured prominently in his remarks.
Never more so than in Lincoln, where he advised a youthful a udience watching from the Lincoln College bleachers to make "godly choices."
His first applause line of the day came when he said the Constitution does not demand the separation of church and state.
He warned of a "dictatorship of the judges."
"If there are no godly choices, be a godly choice," Keyes said.
"By preaching the Gospel, we can transform the nation."
Notable US congressional contests on Tuesday: US SENATE SOUTH DAKOTA South Dakota's congressional delegation has confounded Republican leaders for years.
The sparsely populated state is staunchly Republican George ring Republican Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the Senate's only Native American.
A conservative businessman, Coors' opposition to the death penalty got him into hot water with some Colorado voters when he said during a debate that he would oppose the execution of Osama bin Laden.
He also drew criticism for saying he favored lowering the legal drinking age to 18.
Salazar's family has been farming in the same region of Colorado and New Mexico for generations, and he is seen as having an edge with the roughly 17 percent of Coloradans who share his Hispanic heritage.
FLORIDA In Florida, a key battleground state, Democratic educator Betty Castor is in a neck and neck battle with Republican Mel Martinez, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the George W. Bush administration.
If he wins, Martinez (along with Colorado's Salazar, should the Democrat prevail in Colorado) would be the first Hispanic in the Senate in many years.
Recent polls haven states to stump for Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, as well as fellow congressional candidates.
"Barack Obama's importance to our party and our effort to recapture the United States Senate simply cannot be overstated," said Brad Woodhouse, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
The Republican's Illinois Senate campaign unraveled when candidate Jack Ryan withdrew over a sex scandal stemming from the release of steamy court records from a contentious divorce.
The Republicans reached several states away to recruit African American conservative Alan Keyes, a Maryland radio talk show host, to be their standard bearer, but he has largely been rejected by Illinois voters and Obama has built a 45 point lead over Keyes.
Keyes and Obama are vying to replace retiring one term Republican Senator Peter Fitzgerald.
KENTUCKY Democrat Dan Mongiardo was not expected to be much of a contender against popular Republican incumbent Jim Bunning in Kentucky.
But Bunning, 73, a former professional baseball player, squandered a double digit lead after making what some have seen as bizarre and intemperate comments on the campaign trail, and now leads the Democrat by just a few points in the solidly Republican state.
The Hall of Fame pitcher has been hounded by questions about his mental health.
Republicans accuse Democrats of smear tactics, and say they are spreading rumors about Bunning's mental state as an act of desperation Among Bunning's actions which raised eyebrows: he said Mongiardo looked like a son of Saddam Hussein.
He later apologized for the remark.
He also aired TV commercials labeling Mongiardo a "Medicaid millionaire," featuring a luxurious home and a private jet.
But it later turned out that neither the home nor the jet belonged to Mongiardo.
Mongiardo, 44, a doctor and state legislator, is receiving a fresh infusion of cash from the Democratic Party, which likes his chancesr to become Louisiana's governor, but is a shoo in in his current House race.
A Republican, Jindal gained the support of right wing white voters by emphasizing his Catholic faith and socially conservative agenda while downplaying his ethnic heritage.
The 33 year old son of Punjabi immigrants was defeated in the race for governor last year by then Lieutenant Governor Kathleen Blanco.
Jindal is now running for the House in suburban New Orleans.
A poll by Southern Media and Opinion Research places Jindal, with 65 percent support, comfortably ahead of his nearest rival, State Representative Steve Scalise.
A large majority of the voters polled were white, demonstrating his cross over appeal in a state where political allegiances are often formed partly on the basis of ethnicity.
TEXAS Texas Democrats and Republicans are now evenly represented in the House with 16 seats each.
But under a controversial redistricting plan engineered by House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, Republicans could control as many as 22 seats after next week's election.
A Republican redrawing of the election map could cost the Democrats as many as six House seats including that of longtime Representative Martin Frost of Dallas, whose district was reconfigured into a predominately Republican enclave.
The US Supreme Court reopened the bitter Texas redistricting feud two weeks ago by ordering a federal district court to reconsider the Republican drawn map, which had been approved earlier by a three judge federal panel in Austin.
The ruling will have no effect on the November 2 election, although it may overturn the redistricting plan down the road.
U.S. Sen Barack Obama can add Grammy award winner to his resume after winning in the Best Spoken Word category.
Obama won Wednesday for his readings of the autobiographical "Dreams From My Father," which first was published in 1995 but became a best seller as Obama became a rising political star.
Obama, the son of a black father from Kenya and a white mother from Kansas, beat out Garrison Keillor, Al Franken, Sean Penn and George Carlin to win.
His memoir examines race and racial identity.
He joins fellow Democrats Hillary and Bill Clinton in grabbing the trophy.
Hillary Clinton won in 1997 for her spoken word album, "It Takes a Village," and Bill Clinton won for his reading of his autobiography, "My Life."
LOBBYING REFORM PROVES TO BE UPHILL BATTLE ON CAPITOL HILL, AS McCAIN, OBAMA TRY TO MEND RIFT OVER ISSUE, HOUSE WARNS OF RESISTANCE WASHINGTON Lobbying reform, which looked like a sure thing after kingpin lobbyist Jack Abramoff pleaded guilty to corruption charges, is proving more difficult than expected.
Two high profile senators on Wednesday tried to paper over their dispute on their issue, and GOP House members braced for an airing of their sharp differences at a three day retreat that begins today.
Sen John McCain, R Ariz., and Sen Barack Obama, D Ill., testified before a Senate panel that they were committed to working together on reform legislation despite a recent, testy exchange of letters in which McCain accused Obama of injecting partisanship into the issue.
McCain, a potential 2008 presidential candidate, told the rules committee that he valued Obama's efforts to broker a bipartisan agreement.
McCain has proposed making it easier for senators to challenge earmarks, which are projects that lawmakers tack onto spending bills, sometimes at the behest of lobbyists.
Jokingly referring to McCain as his "pen pal," Obama, a freshman and rising star in the Democratic Party, said he not only wanted more scrutiny of earmarks but also to create an independent commission to police the activities of lawmakers and lobbyists.
Obama later said McCain had misunderstood his criticism of a bipartisan lobbying reform task force spearheaded by the Arizona senator.
Obama said his criticism was aimed at Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist's remarks that the task force should study the issue, Obama said the matter needed action, not just talk.
But even as the senators pressed their case for changing the way Congress does business, other lawmakers warned they were meeting resistance from many of their colleagues, particularly to a plan to ban privately funded travel by lawmakers.
Immediately after federal prosecutors reached a plea bargain with Abramoff, who may implicate some lawmakers, congressional leaders rushed to offer lobbying reform plans.
But Sen Russ Feingold, D Wis., a reform advocate, said that in the past two weeks, "we are hearing the sound of furious back peddling in the corridors of power."
In the House, new Majority Leader John Boehner, R Ohio, said he has doubts about barring private groups from paying for congressional trips.
The ban is among several measures proposed by House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R Ill., last month.
Boehner was elected to replace Rep Tom DeLay, R Texas, whom many Republicans feared had become a political liability because of his close ties to Abramoff.
But Boehner also has links to lobbyists.
He rents an apartment in Washington from a lobbyist whose clients have an interest in legislation overseen by the Education and Workforce Committee, which Boehner had recently chaired, the Washington Post reported Wednesday.
Lobbying reform is expected to be the major topic for House Republicans during their retreat on Maryland's eastern shore, said Jo Maney, a spokeswoman for Rep David Dreier, R Calif., who was directed by Hastert to devise lobbying legislation.
The original plan was for the lobbying bill to go to the House floor by March, but no longer.
More lawmakers must weigh in first, Maney said.
"Everybody's got opinions," she remarked.
Sen.
Barack Obama sees parallels between former President Abraham Lincoln's life and his own, but he says the 16th U.S. president credited with freeing U.S. slaves might not have envisioned a black man occupying the seat he now holds.
Obama, who occupies the U.S. Senate seat from Illinois that Lincoln lost to Stephen Douglas in 1858, wrote about how Lincoln shaped his life in an upcoming special issue of Time magazine.
"In Lincoln's rise from poverty, his ultimate mastery of language and law, his capacity to overcome personal loss and remain determined in the face of repeated defeat in all this, he reminded me not just of my own struggles.
He also reminded me of a larger, fundamental element of American life the enduring belief that we can constantly remake ourselves to fit our larger dreams," Obama wrote.
The issue is on newsstands Monday.
Obama, the son of a Kenyan father and American mother who is just the fifth black senator in U.S. history, also raised questions about Lincoln's role in ending slavery.
"I cannot swallow whole the view of Lincoln as the Great Emancipator," Obama said.
"As a law professor and civil rights lawyer and as an African American, I am fully aware of his limited views on race.
Anyone who actually reads the Emancipation Proclamation knows it was more a military document than a clarion call for justice."
And as for what Lincoln may have thought about Obama's election to the Senate in 2004?
"He may not have dreamed of that exact outcome.
But I like to believe he would have appreciated the irony," Obama said.
U.S. Sen Barack Obama, an Illinois Democrat, met Tuesday with Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom and said that the United States stood by Israel as its leader, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, lay unconscious in a hospital bed following a massive stroke.
Obama, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke to reporters after a meeting with Shalom, on the latest leg of a 10 day tour of the Middle East that included visits to Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan and the Palestinian territories.
"Obviously we are here at a difficult time," he said.
"Our hearts go out to the family of Prime Minister Sharon and we are praying for a recovery on his part and I think the entire world is watching because we recognize that his presence here in the entire process was absolutely important and constructive."
Obama said he was visiting the region to learn more than tell leaders his opinion.
"Israel has to figure out what the next steps are, if in fact Prime Minister Sharon does not recover in a way that allows him to move into the government," he said.
Obama said he was encouraged about the "growing consensus around a principle of moving peace forward if there is a responsible partner on the other side," and was looking forward to the results of the Palestinians' Jan 25 elections and their aftermath.
"Violence is not the answer to the long standing problems that exist in this area and my hope is that U.S. policy will continue to encourage the nonviolent mediation of these issues," he said.
Most politicians spend their careers working to overcome flaws.
Then there are politicians like Barack Obama.
So charismatic that his greatest challenge has been trying to play down expectations during his first Senate term, Obama's enviable plight was neatly underlined at a black tie dinner here last weekend, as President Bush facetiously tried to roast him.
"Senator Obama, I want to do a joke on you," the president told the audience at the annual Gridiron dinner, an event where politicians and the press mingle to make fun of one another.
"But doing a joke on you is like doing a joke on the pope.
Give me something to work with.
Mispronounce something."
Ribbing aside, Obama's seeming perfection as a gifted orator, award winning author and proven intellect who was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review has become something of a political marvel in itself, as Democrats survey the landscape of potential presidential candidates and endlessly wonder if he is the one to lead them back into favor after a season of darkness.
But such grand expectations can, by turns, be a curse not only for Obama himself but for the party overall.
From William Jennings Bryan, who electrified the populace with his 1896 "cross of gold" speech, to former Sen John Edwards, who briefly dazzled the Democratic Party before fizzling out in the 2004 presidential race, fledgling superstars have often learned the perils of soaring expectations the hard way.
"Perfection is always risky," said Darrell M. West, a professor of politics at Brown University.
If Obama's popularity and reputation among Democrats grow, will it be possible, his advisers and other Democrats wonder, for Obama to maintain his smooth trajectory over time?
How can he lower expectations, to reduce the impact of any future misstep?
Could voters and the press tire of his impeccability, and start looking harder for flaws?
(One admitted speck: A smoking habit that he is working to break, and a past experimentation with drugs.)
Historians and political strategists see lessons for the senator's future in the stories of wunderkinds from the past.
"The ones who have been successful were very focused in understanding where they wanted to go, and had a good strategy to get there," West said.
"You can't wait too long because golden boys only last so long and then they start to tarnish.
And then they just become one of the pack, and there's nothing special about them."
To some, at this early stage, Obama is most directly comparable with John F. Kennedy, whose youth, dashing looks and captivating speaking skills catapulted him to national stardom in 1956, when, as a first term senator, he campaigned for the vice presidential nomination, four years later he was elected president.
His assassination in 1963 raised him to the category of permanent golden status among Democrats.
Of course, that was a time when it was easier to sparkle.
Kennedy benefited from a cozy press corps that largely left personal issues alone, something Obama could never count on.
Other political stars have fallen over time, as shining promise has given way to the inevitable disappointment of reality.
Even when he was still a basketball player, well before he was elected to the Senate, Bill Bradley seemed destined for greatness.
He dominated the spotlight for a time, but stumbled, and his political career ended in the Democratic presidential primaries in 2000.
John Edwards made a splash when elected to the Senate in 1998, but he quickly suffered from criticism that he was light on gravitas and failed to live up to some expectations that he was the next Bill Clinton.
The historian Doris Kearns Goodwin argued that Bryan, the three time Democratic presidential nominee, dazzled the country in a way comparable to the Obama phenomenon with that one speech in 1896.
But he faced too much resistance to his perceived radical populism to win election and, having lost, wore the indelible taint of failure.
History has not been kind.
Robert Dallek, the author of several presidential biographies, said that such "golden boy" leaders have emerged "in a time of frustration and disillusionment," but that few, apart from Kennedy, sustained the momentum.
"Kennedy hadn't done much, there wasn't much of a congressional record you could point to, and so people said, 'Wow, this guy has got imagination and principles,"' Dallek said.
More recently, glamorous governors like Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, both Republicans, have lost some of their luster after clashing with state legislatures.
By that standard, Mark Warner, a Democrat and the former governor of Virginia, may have benefited from the law requiring him to step down after one term, without more of a record to haunt him, he has had the luxury of picking issues to champion, unlike his potential rivals in the Senate, who still must vote on everything from the federal budget to Iraq.
Warner is now among the Democrats contemplating running in 2008.
"The longer you are in a position of making the hard decisions, weighing in on the difficult questions, the weaker you become," said Mario M. Cuomo, whose rousing 1984 speech at the Democratic National Convention, during his first term as governor of New York, fueled a decade of chatter about his greater political potential before he finally lost a re election bid to George Pataki in 1994.
"The third term is a killer," Cuomo said.
"I had three terms, and what happens is, people get to know you so well, and their instinct is to be angry with the negative more than it is to appreciate the positive."
But when asked whether he saw a comparison in his early rave reviews to those Obama is experiencing now, Cuomo demurred.
"I'm a whole different story," Cuomo said.
"I'm not in his class at all."
Still, Obama has yet to finish one term as senator a reality he seems keenly aware of, as he lightly mocks his own press coverage while slowly beginning to promote his legislative work, like pushing for research on the avian flu.
Obama seems, at times, to be balancing the need to reduce unrealistic expectations with the wish to retain his golden mystique.
Even in acknowledging, with some embarrassment, his ongoing cigarette smoking habit, Obama has managed to turn it into an expression of his imperfection, telling The Chicago Tribune last year: "The flesh is weak."
Obama did not return a call seeking comment, but in his Gridiron speech, which brought down the house, he tweaked the press for its fawning coverage so far a recurring theme he has hit upon in response to an excessive crush of media attention from the start of his political career.
"I want to thank you for all the generous advance coverage you've given me in anticipation of a successful career," Obama said.
"When I actually do something, we'll let you know."
And no doubt, when that happens, the world will notice.
Conservatives overreacted when they threatened to boycott doll maker American Girl over its contributions to a youth group that supports abortion rights, U.S. Sen Barack Obama said Monday.
"It's just silly," said Obama, an Illinois Democrat.
"This is a classic example of overreaction and a lack of proportion."
Speaking before the youth group's Omaha chapter, Obama praised Girls Inc. and said it played an important role in helping girls set goals for themselves.
"An organization like this plays a vital part in making certain we are opening up our windows and letting our girls look upon the horizon and see which path they want to follow," he said.
Earlier this month, the American Family Association asked its roughly 2.2 million members to tell American Girl they don't support the company's connection to Girls Inc.
The Pro Life Action League also has asked its supporters to do likewise.
The protest is directed at an ongoing American Girl campaign in which proceeds from sales of a special "I Can" wristband help support educational and empowerment programs of Girls Inc.
The AFA called it "a pro abortion, pro lesbian advocacy group."
Randy Sharp, director of special projects for the AFA, said Obama was entitled to his opinion and the group will continue to urge its members to contact American Girl and Mattel Inc.
Illinois Democratic Sen Barack Obama on Tuesday called for a troop reduction in Iraq and criticized the Bush administration for questioning the patriotism of people who speak out against the war.
"I believe that U.S. forces are still a part of the solution in Iraq," he said according to a prepared text of Obama's speech to the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations.
"The strategic goals should be to allow for a limited drawdown of U.S. troops, coupled with shift to a more effective counter insurgency strategy that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead and intensifies our efforts to train Iraqi forces."
Following the Dec 15 Iraqi elections, Obama said the United States should focus over the course of the next year on how to reduce its troops there.
The freshman senator stressed that he was not calling for an immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops.
"It is not appropriate from my perspective for us to unilaterally and precipitously pull all our troops out immediately,The question is can we reduce our presence in Iraq systematically and ,reduce the enormous strains on our military that right now is at a breaking point?"
Obama told reporters after his speech.
White House spokesman Allen Abney said the administration's policy has "always been for a conditions based withdrawal" from Iraq.
But he said the White House would not set an arbitrary timetable.
Obama who has captured national attention since giving the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention last year declined to provide specific troop reduction numbers but said the administration and military need to provide a timeframe for the phased withdrawal.
"The Iraqi people like the American people are recognizing that a phased withdrawal is appropriate and that there should be some timeframe around that.
It doesn't have to be a date certain that suddenly ,all troops are pulled out, but there has to be a game plan by which the Iraqis take more responsibility for their own security," he said.
The U.S. lawmaker also joined the chorus of politicians defending decorated Vietnam War veteran Rep John Murtha, a Pennsylvania Democrat, who was criticized by the Bush administration and other Republicans after calling for an immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops.
"We watched the shameful attempt to paint John Murtha a Marine Corp recipient of two purple hearts and a Bronze Star into a coward of questionable patriotism," Obama said.
The administration has since toned down its criticism of Murtha with Bush over the weekend calling him "a fine man" and longtime supporter of the military.
Obama said Americans want to find solutions to the "difficult and complicated situation in Iraq."
"The President could take the politics out of Iraq once and for all if he would simply go on television and say to the American people 'Yes, we made mistakes.
Yes, there are things I would have done differently.
But now that we're here, I am willing to work with both Republicans and Democrats to find the most responsible way out,'" Obama said.
Republican Sen John McCain accused his Democratic colleague Barack Obama of "partisan posturing" on the issue of lobbying ethics reform a charge Obama called puzzling and regrettable.
The exchange, made in letters between the pair, was the latest sign of trouble as the two parties try to come up with legislation governing relations with lobbyists.
Based on past Obama statements, "I concluded your professed concern for the institution and the public interest was genuine and admirable," McCain wrote in a letter to Obama on Monday.
"Thank you for disabusing me of such notions."
Obama, a rising star in the Democratic Party, responded in a letter later Monday that he had "no idea what ,prompted" McCain to strike out like that.
"The fact that you have now questioned my sincerity ,is regrettable but does not in any way diminish my deep respect for you nor my willingness to find a bipartisan solution to this problem," Obama wrote.
McCain was responding to an earlier Obama letter in which the first term Democrat last week thanked McCain for including him in bipartisan talks on lobbying reform but expressed some differences in approach to the issue spurred by recent lobbying scandals.
McCain, long a backer of legislation to reduce the influence of big money and special interests in lawmaking, is sponsoring a bill that would require lobbyists to disclose more information on their activities, including the gifts they give lawmakers, double to two years the waiting period before a lawmaker can take a job as a lobbyist and require members to pay charter rates when they travel on corporate jets.
Obama, in last week's letter, promoted a bill backed by House and Senate Democrats that would take similar action on members becoming lobbyists, disclosure and corporate jets.
It also bans gifts, meals from lobbyists or organizations that employ lobbyists and creates a new office of public integrity in the House to monitor compliance of lobbying rules.
Obama also questioned the effectiveness of McCain's proposal to set up a task force to further study the lobbying ethics issue.
Aides to McCain confirmed that McCain saw Obama's first letter as partisan.
"I'm embarrassed to admit that after all these years in politics I failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self interested partisan posturing appear more noble," McCain wrote.
"During my short time in the U.S. Senate," Obama responded Monday, "one of the aspects about this institution that I have come to value most is the collegiality and the willingness to put aside partisan differences to work on issues that help the American people.
It was in this spirit that I approached you to work on ethics reform, and it was in this spirit that I agreed to attend your bipartisan meeting last week."
Obama, the first black man in the Senate in 25 years and only the fifth in history, became an overnight celebrity with his keynote address to the Democrats' 2004 party convention.
Almost overnight, Obama, the son of a black father from Kenya and a white mother from the U.S., became a darling of the party.
The guilty plea by former lobbyist Jack Abramoff early this year to various felony charges involving his attempts to influence Congress touched off numerous efforts by Republicans and Democrats to move legislation tightening up restrictions on interactions with lobbyists.
But initial promises by the two parties to work together have been hard to keep, with Republicans irritated by Democratic attempts to link the lobbying issue to what they call a Republican "culture of corruption."
Attempts by the House Republican leadership to craft a Republican bill have also met resistance from some in the party's rank and file who say a total ban on gifts and privately financed travel is an overreaction to the problem.
In the Senate, Majority Leader Bill Frist has asked the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to vote on a bill the week of Feb 27.
The top Democrat on that panel, Sen Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, is a cosponsor of the McCain bill.
Sen.
Barack Obama is showing the Midas touch in his first year in Congress.
He's already a best selling author, a Grammy Award winner and now he is an important fundraiser for fellow Democrats.
Altogether, the first term U.S. senator from Illinois has helped raise $6.5 million (euro5.45 million) for his political action committee and other Democratic candidates, party committees and U.S. state parties from New Jersey to Virginia to Florida.
A former Illinois state senator and Chicago community activist, Obama rode to U.S. Senatorial victory in 2004, after a rousing Democratic National Convention speech.
Some Democrats have hailed him as the future of the party.
He brought in about $800000 (euro670466) in donations with an e mail message sent out on activist Web site MoveOn.org on behalf of Democratic Sen Robert C. Byrd, of West Virginia, who at age 88 is seeking a ninth term in office.
"He said some nice things about me," Byrd recalled.
"Anywhere he comes in West Virginia we will give the man a great reception.
He's a wonderful man."
Some of Obama's fundraising activities are part of his job as a vice chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
"These are trips not initiated by me, these are trips that other people think will be helpful," Obama said, noting he has family and political obligations in Illinois.
"For every invitation I've accepted, I've turned down 100."
"I've been incredibly blessed," he said in an interview with The Associated Press.
"My attitude is as long as I work hard, as long as I operate honestly, with integrity, the worst that can happen to me is that I can lose an election."
Being the Senate's lone black member and only the fifth black senator in history, Obama has prompted many fellow Democrats and others to wonder if he will become the nation's first black president, or vice president.
"The party needs him and, for all I know, the nation needs him," said George Washington University political analyst Stephen Hess.
"There hasn't been an African American Democrat who has had an appeal broadly beyond his ethnic group."
Senate Democrats and Republicans alike, who often use "gentleman," and "humble," and "hard working" to describe Obama, the 44 year old married father of two daughters, say he is destined for bigger roles in the years ahead.
"I think people look at him and think he's clearly, clearly going to continue to grow in influence in the Senate and in national politics," said Republican Sen Mike DeWine.
"I've been here 31 years and seen a small handful of people that have made as much an impression as he has and he has done it by working hard," said Democratic Sen Patrick Leahy.
In Illinois, Republican state lawmaker Kirk Dillard, said he has been impressed with Obama since they successfully worked together on campaign finance reform years ago.
"I believe Illinois and America are looking for a hero and somebody who gives us hope, as we saw at Coretta King's funeral, that we can be a color blind society," Dillard said.
"It's not just based on race.
It's based on we want a hero in general."
Obama trailed only the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and former Secretary of State Colin Powell in support among blacks asked to name the nation's "most important black leader," according to an AP AOL poll released last week.
When asked if he feels burdened by others' expectations, Obama said, "I remind them that's a pretty high class problem to have.
I remind them that the people who are burdened don't have health care and see their kid get sick."
He won a Grammy this year in the spoken word category for his readings from his autobiographical "Dreams From My Father," a memoir first published in 1995 that has become a best seller as his fame has grown.
In the trenches of the Senate, Obama has worked as a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee to improve disability pay for Illinois' military veterans after news reports showed the state has been ranked nearly last in that category for decades.
He has traveled abroad with Republican Sen Richard Lugar, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and worked in bipartisan fashion to address the need of destroying surplus and unguarded conventional and nuclear weapons.
With only a few months on the job, as a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, he was credited with playing a key role in winning transportation projects for Illinois.
A couple of weeks ago, Obama and Republican Sen John McCain got in a dustup as they exchanged letters on how they should be moving toward lobbyist ethics reform.
McCain accused Obama of turning partisan on an issue where he claimed he would be nonpartisan.
The argument was apparently resolved with a smile and backslap from Obama at a congressional hearing.
Introduced to a sold out luncheon for black Harvard Law School alumni as a rock star and a hero, US Senator Barack Obama urged the nearly 1000 people in attendance to take personal responsibility in combating the urban poverty brought to light after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans.
"The people that we saw in front of the Superdome and in front of the convention center, they had been abandoned before the hurricane," Obama, an Illinois Democrat, said.
Mayhem and violence were not phenomena created by the disaster, Obama said.
They have existed in inner cities across the country while the nation's political leaders have stood by, largely indifferent, he said.
"The violence has always been there.
It just wasn't on your television screen because it wasn't spilling out onto the lives of the rest of us," said Obama, who lives in Chicago's South Side.
Obama, a 1991 Harvard Law School graduate who in 1990 became the first black editor of the Harvard Law Review, delivered the keynote address Saturday during the school's three day Celebration of Black Alumni.
People stood along the back of the white tent, hovered between tables, and spilled into the courtyard for a glimpse at the man who many call a rising star in the Democratic party.
Law students lined the stairs of a nearby building to hear the speech, which was broadcast in two classrooms set up to handle the overflowing crowd.
Last summer's Democratic National Convention in Boston served as Obama's "coming out party," said Elena Kagan, dean of the law faculty, when Obama, then an Illinois state senator running for US Senate, mesmerized the audience with his speech about the audacity of hope.
At Saturday's luncheon, Kagan presented the 44 year old Obama with the Harvard Law School Association Award, the school's highest honor, for being a "gifted orator, dynamic leader, public servant extraordinaire, and pride of Harvard Law School."
Obama challenged his fellow alumni to do everything they can to alleviate the "festering sores of poverty and racism," and hold national leaders accountable for their promises.
He said the federal government's slow response to the hurricane stemmed not from racism, but from indifference.
"I do not ascribe to the White House ,any active malice," Obama said.
"But rather what was revealed was a passive indifference that is common in our culture, common in our society the sense that of course once the evacuation order was issued that you will hop in your SUV with $100 worth of gasoline and load up your truck with sparkling water and take your credit card and check into the nearest hotel until the storm passed.
And the notion that folks couldn't do that simply did not register in the minds of those in charge."
Miles LeBlanc, a 1981 alumnus and the general counsel for the Houston Community College System, likened Hurricane Katrina to a "gigantic yellow highlighter highlighting all the inequities that exist in our country."
In a public question and answer session after the speech, LeBlanc told Obama that community colleges are working to train evacuees now in Houston with new job skills such as construction and plumbing.
Obama said he would work to get them federal funding.
"We want to ensure that people who've been displaced have opportunities to participate in the rebuilding of their own communities," Obama said.
This weekend marked the second gathering for black alumni at Harvard Law School, which except for the historically black Howard University School of Law in Washington, D.C. has produced more black lawyers than any other law school in the United States, organizers said.
The first gathering was held in 2000 after the school felt it needed to better connect with its black alumni, many of whom felt disaffected and distant from their Harvard experience, LeBlanc said.
Events like the one held this weekend, he said, have "gone a long way to bring black alumni back in the fold of the law school."
DOVER, Pa.
After Super Mario swam the clear blue sea and someone beat someone else at foosball and a girl named Kate quoted the Gospel of John to explain why God is an unavoidable fact of life, they said grace.
"Dear Heavenly Father," 19 year old Brandon Spangler said.
"We just thank you for this day, for being with us on this wonderful Wednesday."
Near the back of the dinner line in the basement of Dover Bethany United Methodist Church, Ashley Ruppert stopped giggling.
She closed her eyes.
She had spent the morning in biology lab, building fat molecules out of beads and straws, and the afternoon playing video games beneath a bumper sticker that said "I don't have enough FAITH to believe in evolution."
She likes biology, but she doesn't believe in Darwin's theory of evolution.
"There's too many holes," she says.
"Where are the in between stages?
We only have the beginning and the end.
Why can't you see a human that's just extremely hairy?
Or a monkey that's walking upright?"
God and science are at war in Dover, a small community of cornfields, mud spattered pickup trucks and country churches in southern Pennsylvania, where last fall, the School Board decided students should hear a four paragraph statement on intelligent design at the beginning of their ninth grade lesson on evolution.
"Because Darwin's theory is a theory, it continues to be tested as new evidence is discovered," the statement says.
"The theory is not a fact.
Gaps in the theory exist for which there is no evidence,Intelligent design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin's view."
The school district was sued by 11 parents, including Tammy Kitzmiller, a woman with blond feathered hair whose daughter Jessica chose to stand out in the hallway rather than listen when the statement was read in her biology class.
"I feel that they have brought a religious idea into the classroom, and I object to that," Kitzmiller told a judge this week.
"I do not think this is good science."
In a federal courtroom in Harrisburg, a landmark case is unfolding.
It is about the meaning of the separation of church and state in a country where a recent Harris poll found that nearly two thirds of adults believe human beings were created directly by God.
It is about whether intelligent design is a new science or just a new way of talking about creationism.
And everyone knows it is about more than just one small Pennsylvania town.
The lawyers are already talking about taking this case to the Supreme Court.
In Dover Township, a rough triangle of farmland dotted with red barns, pizza places and used car lots, they are talking, too.
About why people in hot climates have darker skin than people in cold climates.
About the structure of the human eye and the minds of teenagers, because in some fundamental way, this case is about what a 13 year old thinks when she looks through a microscope.
In Dover, there is no hard line between scientific questions and spiritual ones.
This is a place where kids do their chemistry homework with Christian rock playing in the background.
If we're made up of atoms and there's a lot of space between the nucleus and the electrons, Ashley Ruppert wants to know why we're not full of holes.
If we came from mud, how did the mud get here?
And if God made everything, where did He come from?
Up in Harrisburg, lawyers for the School Board say they are fighting for open mindedness, for the right to ask any question.
They say Darwin's theory of evolution has become dogma, and that intelligent design is "science in its purest form," like Newton's experiments with gravity.
"It shares the attitude of those who worked in the field of quantum mechanics, who posited the wave particle duality, despite the fact that to some it smacked of the supernatural," Patrick Gillen, a lawyer for the School Board, told the judge.
In the courtroom, the two sides are ranged like opposing armies.
Here you have the parents in suits and flowered skirts and their lawyers from the ACLU. Over there, the School Board members and their lawyers from the Thomas More Law Center, a Michigan firm whose stated purpose is "to be a sword and shield for people of faith."
Reporters sit in the jury box, because there is no jury in this trial, only a judge.
The first to testify is Dr Kenneth R. Miller, a professor at Brown University who co wrote Biology, the textbook the kids in Dover use.
He says he started writing textbooks because he wanted teenagers to know that there are still things out there to discover, things in nature that are explained by natural processes.
Not ideas like intelligent design.
"Intelligent design is not science," Miller said.
It is the theory that some things in nature are best explained by an intelligent cause, not natural selection.
But human beings are fallible, Miller says, and if you invoke a spiritual cause, a scientist cannot test it.
You can't order it from a biological supply place or grow it in a petri dish or test it in a laboratory.
An idea like this might even stop kids from wanting to do scientific research.
What's the point, Miller asks, if the only way we can explain the miracle of life is by pointing to a creator?
Miller believes in God, but he says there are questions science can answer and questions you might ask a priest, and they aren't the same thing.
"If I could solve the question of the meaning of my life by doing an experiment in my laboratory, I assure you I would run off and do it right now," he tells the judge.
He starts to explain evolution.
Some genes have errors, and by comparing those errors, you can test genetic links.
On a screen along the wall, a picture of apes appears.
The courtroom is quiet, but you can hear the echo.
In 1925, during the Scopes trial, they had chimpanzees doing tricks out on Main Street in Dayton, Tenn.
The slide shows a chimpanzee, a gorilla and a human being.
They all share the exact same set of genetic mistakes, Miller says.
They're all primates.
All came from Africa.
Horses, cats and dogs don't have the same genetic mistakes we do.
Matching mistakes spell common ancestry.
Twenty five miles away in Dover, Ashley Ruppert flips through Miller's Biology.
She is sitting at KT's restaurant across the street from the high school, eating french fries.
They haven't gotten to the section on evolution yet, but Ashley has already Googled Darwin and talked about intelligent design with her mom.
"Why is it easier to believe that we evolved from monkeys than that we were created by a higher power?"
Beth Ruppert asks when she comes to take Ashley home.
"I don't get it."
She's not the only one.
In Dover, 100 people turn out for a junior varsity field hockey game on a Tuesday night and the cheerleaders stop practicing and stand at attention when the national anthem plays.
It's a place where kids race high wheeled pickup trucks through muddy fields on weekends a pastime known as muddin' and listen to the Doors and Aerosmith.
"It's like it never got out of the past," says Brandon Miller, 17.
But there are dissenters here.
In the high school parking lot one evening, Jeremy Naylor, the senior class president, gets talking about the lessons of ninth grade biology.
"We didn't really evolve from monkeys," he says.
"It's a long process and what it says is it basically started out with, like, a puddle."
Jeremy isn't religious.
He doesn't think intelligent design has any place in school.
Ernie Seigle, an 18 year old senior, agrees, even though he goes to church every Sunday before his 12 hour factory shift.
He believes in the separation of church and state.
""I don't need to be in church every day of the week," Ernie says.
Dissent is never easy.
In the courtroom, Bryan Rehm, a high school physics teacher and one of the parents suing the school district, says living in Dover has gotten harder.
"You used to be able to go out to any restaurant, sit down, not worry about who was next to you," he tells the judge.
"You could walk down the street and say "Hi' to everybody and get a nice pleasant return.
Now people stare."
They sometimes call him an atheist now.
And worse.
"They don't know me," he says.
"They don't know that I'm the co director of the children's choir at church or that I run the music halfway at the second service, or that, you know, my wife and I run Vacation Bible School.
Yet they have no problem going around calling me an atheist because my particular religious viewpoint doesn't agree with that of the School Board."
At a School Board meeting last fall, Rehm says, one board member said something like: "Two thousand years ago, somebody died on a cross, can't somebody stand up and take a stand for him?"
The defense lawyers deny it.
"It's one of those things that I couldn't believe," Rehm said.
In Dover, it doesn't sound so strange.
At the Salem United Church of Christ, the marquee says, "This church under same management for over two thousand years!"
A sign across the street reads: "We walk by the spirit, not by sight."
Up the road at the Lighthouse Baptist Church, where pamphlets assure you that hell is for real, Pastor Sterling Walsh Jr. says the evidence of the natural world points directly to a creator.
Anyone can see it, even a child.
"If you grow up in a rural area like this, you just go out and see God," Walsh says.
"It's obvious to everybody until we talk each other out of it.
It's obvious there must be something out there that's intelligent."
On a table at the front of the church, there's a plastic bag full of buttons that say "I support Dover school board."
The board isn't asking them to teach intelligent design, Walsh says, just to mention it.
What people are really scared of, he says, is God.
He opens his Bible to Romans, Chapter 1.
The page is dog eared, highlighted, marked with ink.
"That which can be known of God is manifest in them," he reads, "for the invisible things of God can be clearly seen in creation."
At a table in KT's, Ashley Ruppert is talking about the invisible things of nature, how our bodies are made up of cells and tiny bugs live on our skin.
In biology class, she was asked to look through a microscope and draw what she saw.
She drew an amoeba and something called an Oscillatoria, a long green bacteria with stripes like a snake.
She has read Genesis.
The earth without form, God moving over the water.
"It's real bleak," she says.
"I prefer things that are solid."
And that makes her think that maybe there really is a difference, after all, between the questions you ask in biology and the ones you ask in church.
She knows that in science, there are rules governing gravity and atomic mass and the way hydrogen bonds with oxygen.
The rules don't change.
You can ask a question and get an answer.
She knows spiritual questions don't work that way.
"I have a friend who would read the Bible every day," Ashley says.
"She found the answer when she read.
Or what she thought was her answer."
Nothing like gravity.
When you drop a ball, it falls.
It always falls.
'INTELLIGENT DESIGN' FACES FIRST COURT TEST 750 .
Cox News Service ?WASHINGTON A rule instructing high school?biology teachers to tell students that "intelligent design" is a viable scientific alternative to evolution faces its first challenge in a federal court this month.
?The suit was brought by a 11 parents in the Pennsylvania town of Dover who charge the school board is attempting to promote a religion Christianity in violation of the U.S. Constitution.
?The suit has made Dover, a town 100 miles west of Philadelphia with five elementary schools, one intermediate school and one high school, the first battleground in a national struggle over whether alternatives to evolution should be forced into high school texts.
?Intelligent design holds that the development of life on Earth cannot be explained solely on the basis of chemical or biological facts, and instead appears to have been guided a supreme intelligence.
?The town's school board last October passed a resolution requiring that students in a 9th grade biology course be told that evolution "is a theory, not a fact" and that "intelligent design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs" from evolution.
?They students were also invited to read a book, "Of Pandas and People," in the school library.
?The book is published by the Foundation for Thought and Ethics, a Richardson, Texas, nonprofit organization that describes it as a "supplemental biology text for high school students."
The book presents intelligent design as a scientific theory.
Even President Bush weighed in on the national debate, telling Texas newspaper reporters last month that he thought "both sides ought to be taught ,so?people can understand what the debate is about."
?Many scientists call the concept of intelligent design non scientific.
?American Civil Liberties Union lawyers representing the plaintiffs have sought to depict the Dover matter as part of a national effort to install intelligent design in classrooms as a scientific rebuttal of evolution.
The Discovery Institute of Seattle, which calls itself "the nation's leading research organization and think tank on intelligent design," said the case pits "the ACLU against the local school board over its decision to introduce intelligent design into biology classes."
?The institute says it supports scientists who are developing the emerging theory of intelligent design."
These include Charles Thaxton, a Peachtree City, Ga., man sometimes credited with coining the phrase "intelligent design."
Thaxton told lawyers in a deposition that he knew no one on the Dover school board and had nothing to do with the board's decision to incorporate the idea into the biology course.
In arguing that the Dover school board is attempting to promote a religion, the parents cite cases as old as the 1925 Scopes Trial in Tennessee and as recent as a U.S. district court decision earlier this year against the Cobb County, Ga., school board's decision to place stickers disputing the theory of evolution on biology text books.
But much of the legal jockeying leading up to the trial's Sept 26 opening in the state capital of Harrisburg has gravitated to public statements purportedly made by members of the school board last year as they debated and then voted, 6 3, to include intelligent design in the biology course.
At that time, Bill Buckingham, chairman of the board's curriculum committee, was quoted as saying a textbook selected by science teachers for the course was "laced with Darwinism."
Asked if he was promoting Christianity in the public school, Buckingham replied that "this country wasn't founded on Muslim beliefs or evolution" but "on Christianity, and our students should be taught as such," according to plaintiff's lawyers.
He also proposed that the board buy "Of Pandas and People" as a supplementary biology text, but was voted down.
The father of another school board member then donated money to buy 60 copies of the book, according to court documents.
?School board lawyers, without identifying Buckingham by name, say the plaintiffs based much of their case on newspaper accounts of a board member "who, wrestling with addiction to Oxycontin (a pain medication), occasionally allowed political opponents or reporters to put words in his mouth."
The board's lawyers said the plaintiffs had tried but failed to prove that "a cabal of zealots bent on a religious mission" had "ramrodded the curriculum change heedless of the science faculty or community."
Instead, the board's lawyers said, the change was thoroughly debated and board members concluded that "evolution is a theory (not a fact) and that components of the theory ,are contested on scientific grounds."
(Story can end here.
Optional add follows.)
In its October resolution, the board ordered that students be read the following statement before taking up evolution: ?
"Because Darwin's Theory is a theory, it is still being tested as new evidence is discovered.
?The Theory is not a fact.
?Gaps in the Theory exist for which there is no evidence.
A theory is defined as a well tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observations.
"Intelligent design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin's view.
The reference book, 'Of Pandas and People,' is available for students to see if they would like to explore this view in an effort to gain an understanding of what intelligent design actually involves.
As is true with any theory, students are encouraged to keep an open mind."

The latest chapter in a long running debate over teaching evolution in public schools is about to unfold in federal court.
In a civil trial set to begin here Monday, the Dover Area School District will defend its policy requiring ninth grade students to hear about "intelligent design" in a preamble to biology lessons on evolution.
Intelligent design, a concept advanced over the past 15 years, holds that Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection causing gradual changes over time cannot fully explain the origin of life or the emergence of highly complex life forms.
It implies that life on earth was the product of an unidentified intelligent force.
Critics say intelligent design is merely creationism a literal reading of the Bible's story of creation camouflaged in scientific language, and it does not belong in a science curriculum.
Eight Dover families are suing the school district, alleging that the policy violates the constitutional separation of church and state.
"Our objective is to demonstrate that the prior (legal) precedent, which forbids the teaching of creationism, applies here as well," said Eric Rothschild, a Philadelphia attorney representing the families.
The state American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and State are assisting the parents, including lead plaintiff Tammy Kitzmiller.
"The school board has no business instructing children about religious matters," Kitzmiller said at a December news conference on the lawsuit.
The history of evolution litigation dates back to the famous 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial, in which Tennessee biology teacher John T. Scopes was fined $100 for violating a state law that forbade teaching evolution.
The Tennessee Supreme Court reversed his conviction on the narrow ground that only a jury trial could impose a fine exceeding $50, and the law was repealed in 1967.
In 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned an Arkansas state law banning the teaching of evolution.
And in 1987, it ruled that states may not require public schools to balance evolution lessons by teaching creationism.
The issue has become a priority for many religious groups, which accuse scientists of stepping outside their field into the realm of theology with some of their pronouncements.
Dover is believed to have been the first school system in the nation to require students to hear about the concept under the policy adopted in October 2004.
But the clash over intelligent design is evident far beyond this rural district of about 3500 students 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Harrisburg.
In August, the Kansas Board of Education gave preliminary approval to science standards that allow intelligent design style alternatives to be discussed alongside evolution.
President George W. Bush has also weighed in, saying schools should present both concepts.
Richard Thompson, president and chief counsel of the Thomas More Law Center, which is defending the school district, says Dover's policy takes a modest approach.
It requires teachers to read a statement that says intelligent design differs from Darwin's view and refers students to an intelligent design textbook, "Of Pandas and People," for more information.
"All the Dover school board did was allow students to get a glimpse of a controversy that is really boiling over in the scientific community," Thompson said.
The Discovery Institute, a Seattle based think tank that represents scholars who support intelligent design, opposes mandating it in public schools.
Nevertheless, it considers the Dover lawsuit an attempt to squelch voluntary debates over evolution.
"It's Scopes in reverse.
They're going to get a gag order to be placed on teachers across the country," said institute senior fellow John West.
To build their cases, each side is enlisting a battery of academic experts.
Witnesses for the defense include biochemist Michael Behe of Lehigh University, who defended intelligent design in his 1996 book, "Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution."
Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education, which supports teaching evolution in public schools, said the controversy has little to do with science because mainstream scientists have rejected intelligent design theory.
Intelligent design supporters "seem to have shifted virtually entirely to political and rhetorical efforts to sway the general public," Scott said.
"The bitter truth is that there is no argument going on in the scientific community about whether evolution took place."
The following editorial appeared in Monday's Washington Post: With their slick Web sites, pseudo academic conferences and savvy public relations, the proponents of "intelligent design" a "theory" that challenges the validity of Darwinian evolution are far more sophisticated than the creationists of yore.
Rather than attempt to prove that the world was created in six days, they operate simply by casting doubt on evolution, largely using the time honored argument that intelligent life could not have come about by a random natural process and must have been the work of a single creator.
They do no experiments and do not publish in recognized scientific journals.
Nevertheless, this new generation of anti evolutionists, arguing that children have a "right to question" scientific truths, has had widespread success in undermining evolutionary theory.
Perhaps partly as a result, a startling 55 percent of Americans and 67 percent of those who voted for President Bush do not, according to a recent CBS poll, believe in evolution at all.
According to a recent Gallup poll, about a third of Americans believe that the Bible is literally true.
Some of these believers have persuaded politicians, school boards and parents across the country to question their children's textbooks.
In states as diverse as Wisconsin, South Carolina, Kansas, Montana, Arkansas and Mississippi, school boards are arguing over whether to include "intelligent design" in their curriculums.
Last week, in Pennsylvania's Dover School District, an administrator read a statement to ninth grade biology students saying that evolution is not fact.
Over the objections of ninth grade science teachers and of parents who have filed suit, he offered "intelligent design" as an alternative.
Also last week, a Georgia county school board voted to appeal a judge's decision to remove stickers describing evolution as a "theory, not a fact" from school textbooks.
In both cases, the anti evolutionists have been very careful in their choice of language, eschewing mentions of God or the Bible.
Nevertheless, their intent was clear.
As the lawsuit filed by Dover parents states, "intelligent design is neither scientific nor a theory in the scientific sense, it is an inherently religious argument or assertion that falls outside the realm of science."
Discussion of religion in a history or philosophy class is legitimate and appropriate.
To teach intelligent design as science in public schools is a clear violation of the principle of separation of church and state.
It also violates principles of common sense.
In fact, the breadth and extent of the anti evolutionary movement that has spread almost unnoticed across the country should force American politicians to think twice about how their public expressions of religious belief are beginning to affect education and science.
The deeply religious nature of the United States should not be allowed to stand in the way of the thirst for knowledge or the pursuit of science.
Once it does, it won't be long before the American scientific community which already has trouble finding enough young Americans to fill its graduate schools ceases to lead the world.
References to creationism in drafts of a student biology book were replaced with the term "intelligent design" by the time it was published, a witness testified in a landmark trial over a school board's decision to include the concept in its curriculum.
Drafts of the textbook, "Of Pandas and People," written in 1987 were revised after the Supreme Court ruled in June of that year that states could not require schools to balance evolution with creationism in the classroom, said Barbara Forrest, a philosophy professor at Southeastern Louisiana University, in testimony Wednesday.
Forrest reviewed drafts of the textbook as a witness for eight families who are trying to have the intelligent design concept removed from the Dover Area School District's biology curriculum.
The families contend that teaching intelligent design effectively promotes the Bible's view of creation, violating the separation of church and state.
Intelligent design holds that life on Earth is so complex that it must have been the product of some higher force.
Opponents of the concept say intelligent design is simply creationism stripped of overt religious references.
Forrest outlined a chart of how many times the term "creation" was mentioned in the early drafts versus how many times the term "design" was mentioned in the published edition.
"They are virtually synonymous," she said.
Under the policy approved by Dover's school board in October 2004, students must hear a brief statement about intelligent design before classes on evolution.
The statement says Charles Darwin's theory is "not a fact" and has inexplicable "gaps."
Forrest also said that intelligent design proponents have freely acknowledged that their cause is a religious one.
She cited a document from the Discovery Institute, a Seattle based think tank that represents intelligent design scholars, that says one of its goals is "to replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God."
Under cross examination by school board lawyer Richard Thompson, Forrest acknowledged that she had no evidence that board members who voted for the curriculum change had either seen or heard of the Discovery Institute document.
The trial began Sept 26 and is expected to last as long as five weeks.
When Casey Brown testified last week week, she embodied the pain and division the intelligent design controversy has wrought in Dover, just south of here.
Brown sat stiffly on the witness stand, her mouth as tight as her gray ponytail, recounting how she had run for school board on the same ticket as the board members now facing her from the defense table.
The board is being sued by 11 parents who say that intelligent design is creationism cloaked as science, is inherently religious and has no place in a ninth grade biology class.
Brown said her political alliances and friendships had become strained in the last couple of years as some board members had pressed for changing the biology curriculum to teach creationism on par with evolution.
They wanted to buy an intelligent design textbook, "Of Pandas and People," in place of the newest edition of the standard biology text.
Under cross examination by Patrick Gillen, a soft spoken defense lawyer, Brown was asked whether she recalled visiting the home of a board member and admiring a carving of the Last Supper.
"The Lord's Last Supper, yes sir," Brown said.
"I had never seen such a beautiful carving."
But she said she did not feel comfortable when the board member asked her if she was a born again Christian.
She also said she felt disturbed when another board member, who was among those most insistent about teaching creationism, drove her home from a meeting and asked the same question.
Suddenly, his manner changing, Gillen pounced: These were Brown's friends, she was in their homes, in their cars, and she found it offensive to be asked about religion?
"Yes, I do, and I still do, sir," she said.
A bite in his voice, Gillen asked if she thought religion should not be discussed at all.
"I wouldn't presume to discuss religion within normal circumstances," she said, "except within my own family."
Brown and her husband quit the board the night members voted 6 3 for intelligent design.
WORLDS IN CONFLICT The trial presents a particular challenge for the journalists from science magazines.
In the courtroom hallway during a break last week, Celeste Biever, a reporter for NewScientist, was interviewing a courtroom regular, a bearded local pastor who says he considers evolution a lie.
"You want half bird, half fish?"
Biever asked, drawing a dotted line on her notepad.
"Yeah, why not," the pastor said.
Later, out of the pastor's hearing, Biever said with fascination, "He thinks evolution is a bird turning into a fish turning into a rabbit" one straight line of common descent, instead of a tree with common roots.
Biever was finding that she could not cover the trial the way she would a classic courtroom face off.
When you put intelligent design up against evolution, she said, "It's not a head on collision between two scientific arguments, it's orthogonal," with the opponents coming at each other from right angles.
"It's apples and oranges," Biever said.
Her readers do not take intelligent design seriously, she said, so she was striving for "local color."
Her readers want to know, she said, "Why is this happening here?"
"We're not just science cheerleaders, and I don't want to overlook any valid argument for intelligent design," Biever said.
"As far as I'm concerned, I haven't heard one yet."
As for the pastor, after four days of listening to science experts dismantling the case for intelligent design, he was unimpressed.
"They're babblers," said the pastor, the Rev. Jim Grove, who leads a 40 member independent Baptist church outside of Dover.
"The more Ph.D.'s you get, it seems like the further away from God you get."
Dover school board members were well aware they were inviting a lawsuit over church state issues when they voted last October that biology students should hear a statement telling them that there were gaps in the theory of evolution and that intelligent design was another theory the students should examine.
But board members forged ahead, having been assured that they would have the backing of the Thomas More Law Center, a nonprofit law firm dedicated to providing legal representation to Christians, and its chief counsel, Richard Thompson.
ONE SIDE OF THE CULTURE WAR In courtroom breaks Thompson occasionally sits next to board members and puts an arm around their shoulders.
White haired and dapper, he has said little in court, leaving most of the cross examination to his two co counselors.
But last week, he became the public face of the intelligent design movement, stepping into the ring of cameras and microphones outside the courthouse each afternoon, taking every question until, one after another, the reporters slipped away.
As a former Michigan prosecutor who tried repeatedly to convict Dr Jack Kevorkian, Thompson is comfortable in the spotlight.
He failed in his prosecution of Kevorkian and eventually lost a bid for re election, voters told pollsters they did not share his outrage over assisted suicide.
Thompson's major argument in defending the board is that intelligent design is not religion, but science.
He is, however, absolutely open about his own religious motivations.
During the lunch break on Thursday, Thompson said he founded the law center to defend Christians who he thought were losing the culture wars.
The center was initially financed by Thomas Monaghan, the founder of Domino's Pizza.
Both men are Roman Catholics.
"There are two worldviews that are in conflict," Thompson said.
"I do feel that even though Christians are 86 percent of the population, they have become second class citizens."
In Harrisburg, Pa., lawyers are in court on Wednesday arguing whether intelligent design should be taught in biology class alongside evolution.
As Richard Thompson, the lawyer representing the school board members who favor teaching intelligent design, said, "There are two worldviews that are in conflict."
On Tuesday night, in Arcata, Calif., in another trial involving evolution's place in the school curriculum, a lawyer told a jury, "The contest between evolution and Christianity is a duel to the death, between the unbelief that attempts to speak through so called science, and the defenders of the Christian faith."
The difference is that the Pennsylvania trial, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, is real, while the one taking place on the other side of the country is a play performed by L.A. Theater Works and drawn from the transcripts of the famed Scopes "monkey trial" of 1925, when a high school teacher in Tennessee was indicted for teaching evolution.
Observing the 80th anniversary of the Scopes trial, Theater Works began its 23 city tour of Peter Goodchild's radio play "The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial" on Tuesday night with a rotating cast of actors that includes Edward Asner, Michael Learned, John de Lancie and Tom Bosley.
Many places where the play, directed by Gordon Hunt, will be performed mainly college campuses are sponsoring additional events like panel discussions and workshops with the actors.
Susan Albert Loewenberg, the producing director of L.A. Theater Works, said recently: "This is not agitprop theater.
Hopefully, this docudrama will enable people to think about the issue.
The presentation will help to create a useful national conversation."
But she emphasized that the theater company is not promoting either side of the argument.
After this week's performances at Humboldt State University, the company will make stops in Nashville, Tenn., Green Bay, Wis., Purchase, N.Y., and other cities before finishing the tour in Los Angeles in March.
"I think the timing is great because it's something that's in controversy right now," said Roy Furshpan, the director of Center Arts, which is sponsoring this week's performances at Humboldt State.
Furshpan was not expecting much contention over the performance.
"Arcata is a fairly liberal town," he said.
But in Tennessee, home of the Scopes trial, the issue is white hot, said Bridgette Kohnhorst, assistant director of performing and fine arts at Vanderbilt University, where the show and forum are scheduled for Oct 19.
Kohnhorst said she had been working on the project long before the Dover School Board voted to include intelligent design in the science curriculum.
The timing, though, is serendipitous, she said, adding, "You begin conversations about something like this a whole year earlier, and then what could be better?"
Loewenberg originally commissioned Goodchild, a writer and producer at the British Broadcasting Corp., in 1992 to work on an adaptation of the Scopes trial transcripts.
("Inherit the Wind," the 1955 play and the 1960 film with Spencer Tracy and Fredric March, was based on the trial.)
The company recorded the show, with Asner as William Jennings Bryan facing off against Charles Durning as Clarence Darrow.
L.A. Theater Works began producing recorded plays in 1987, with a 14 hour recording of the Sinclair Lewis novel "Babbitt."
Now the company has created a library of more than 360 titles the largest collection of its kind in the country.
The recordings are used in an educational outreach program, "Alive and Aloud," which supplies free radio plays and teaching materials to 2000 schools.
"The Play's the Thing," a weekly two hour radio show broadcast on public radio affiliates across the country, features plays, interviews and other programs.
In addition, L.A. Theater Works has an annual season of 10 or more plays at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, where each play is recorded five times in front of a live audience and then edited to create a definitive CD version.
Three years ago, when Loewenberg was thinking about whether to do a show on tour, she reviewed the results of a recent company survey of teachers.
"Surprisingly, we found that Scopes was the most utilized of all the recordings," she said, adding, "and we were already aware of the growing controversy surrounding the teaching of evolution."
The show has traveled before.
When the Kansas State Board of Education decided to remove evolution from the science curriculum in 1999, Loewenberg received a phone call from the television producer Norman Lear.
"He said, 'If I arrange it and pay for it, will you take the Scopes show to Kansas?"'
Lear's advocacy group, People for the American Way, set up a performance the following summer at the Lied Center at the University of Kansas and ran a spirited panel discussion as well, Loewenberg said.
Asner, a Kansas native who was in that show, is one of several actors who has been with the company since its beginning.
As part of the current tour's revolving cast, he is returning a third time to play Bryan, the prosecuting attorney, for the first several stops.
Since Asner, like the other actors, is working for union scale wages, it is not a particularly lucrative venture.
But, he said, "I love doing radio, it's a very gratifying experience."
He added, "It's a phenomenal exercise, like trying to get a tune out of a Schoenberg piece."
In each city on the tour, Loewenberg said, the local National Public Radio affiliate will record and broadcast the production, along with any discussions, to "extend the conversation."
Loewenberg might be interested to find herself in agreement with Bryan, who said at the 1925 trial, "There can be no settlement of a great cause without discussion, and people will not discuss a cause until their attention is drawn to it."
New barrages sounded in the evolution war Monday as lawyers for a group of parents challenged the teaching of intelligent design as nothing more than an old argument for God's hand wrapped in fancy new cloth.
"This clever tactical repackaging of creationism does not merit consideration," Witold Walczak, legal director of the Pennsylvania American Civil Liberties Union and a lawyer for the parents, told U.S. District Judge John E. Jones in opening arguments.
"Intelligent design admits that it is not science unless science is redefined to include the supernatural."
This is, he added, "a 21st century version of creationism."
Eleven parents from Dover, in central Pennsylvania, are seeking to block their school board from requiring that high school biology teachers read a four paragraph statement to students that casts doubt on Darwin's theory of evolution.
This mandatory statement notes that intelligent design offers an alternative theory for the origin and evolution of life namely, that life in all of its complexity could not have arisen without the help of an intelligent hand.
The foremost advocates of intelligent design are silent on whether that intelligent hand belongs to God or some other intelligent force, even including a space alien.
The school board, represented by the Thomas More Law Center, a conservative, religiously grounded nonprofit firm, took the position that the case was about freedom of speech.
"There is in fact a controversy over Darwin's theory," Richard Thompson, chief counsel for the law center, said afterward during an impromptu news conference on the courthouse steps.
"Clearly both theories have religious implications.
But this is not about God."
Last year, however, Dover school board members who voted 6 3 for the new policy made it clear that they believed that the origin of life was guided by a heavenly hand.
Several of them suggested that their views on evolution are far closer to Young Earth Creationism, which holds that God created the world 6000 years ago and that Noah's flood covered Earth, than to intelligent design.
One board member told a public meeting in a remark he has since tried to deny that the nation "was founded on Christianity, and our students should be taught as such."
The war over the teaching of evolution is almost a century old, the first great shot having been fired in Dayton, Tenn., in the famous 1925 Scopes "monkey trial," in which the ACLU defended a teacher convicted of teaching evolution.
Former presidential candidate and prairie populist Williams Jennings Bryan represented the school board.
Another shot sounded in 1987, when the Supreme Court prohibited the teaching of creationism in public schools, ruling that it was not science but religion, and violated the separation of church and state.
Shortly after that Supreme Court ruling, intelligent design began to appear on the lecture circuit, championed by a small band of scientists and academics.
Intelligent design advocates tend to concentrate their criticism on Darwinian theory, they have been far less successful at laying a foundation for a new scientific theory, which by definition must be testable.
This was a point hammered at Monday as the ACLU called its first witness, Kenneth R. Miller, a Brown University biology professor and author of a biology textbook used in nearly half the schools in the nation including in Dover.
Miller noted that virtually every prominent scientific organization in the United States has upheld Darwin's theory of evolution as an unshakeable pillar of science.
Intelligent design, he emphasized, has not fared nearly as well.
"Intelligent design is inherently religious.
It is a form of creationism," Miller said during four hours of testimony that often came to resemble an extended college seminar.
"If you invoke a spiritual force in science, I can't test or replicate it.
"Scientific theories are not hunches," he added.
"When we say 'theory,' we mean a strong, overarching explanation that ties together many facts and enables us to make testable predictions."
The school board's attorneys countered by arguing that several of the leading intelligent design theorists are respected scientists and professors.
And they said the school board merely makes students aware of another viewpoint.
The board also mandated the placement in the school library of the book "Of Pandas and People."
The book makes the case for intelligent design, and the school board's attorneys made the case that it was sort of an alternative textbook.
But Miller rejoined in his testimony that it was nothing of the sort.
He pointed out many examples of outdated or distorted science in the book.
He said the errors were so numerous as to amount to an intentional misreading of science, designed to drive unwary students to reject evolutionary theory.
"The errors in the book are systematic," Miller said.
Both sides plan to call a long line of witnesses, from scientists to philosophers to local teachers and parents.
And, in a rare moment of agreement, they said the case is likely to eventually reach the Supreme Court.
A rural school board showed a clear bias against teaching evolution before it pushed through a plan to introduce "intelligent design" to students, a former board member testified in a trial over whether the concept has a place in public schools.
Aralene "Barrie" Callahan, who was once on the Dover school board and is now among the challengers, said Tuesday that she believed the policy to teach intelligent design was religion based.
Eight families are trying to remove the theory from the Dover Area School District curriculum, arguing that it violates the constitutional separation of church and state.
They say "intelligent design" effectively promotes the Bible's view of creation.
The school district argues it is letting students know there are differences of opinion about evolution, not endorsing any religious view.
Callahan testified that board member Alan Bonsell during a retreat in 2003 "expressed he did not believe in evolution and if evolution was part of the biology curriculum, creationism had to be shared 50 50."
At a school board meeting in June 2004, when she was no longer on the board, Callahan recalled board member Bill Buckingham complaining that a biology book recommended by the administration was "laced with Darwinism."
"They were pretty much downplaying evolution as something that was credible," she said.
In the lawsuit challenging the intelligent design policy, Buckingham was further quoted as saying: "This country was founded on Christianity and our students should be taught as such."
Proponents of intelligent design say life is the product of an unidentified intelligent force, and that Darwin's theory of natural selection over time cannot fully explain the origin of life or the emergence of complex life forms.
In October 2004, the board voted 6 3 to require teachers to read a brief statement about intelligent design to students before classes on evolution.
The statement says Darwin's theory is "not a fact" and has inexplicable "gaps," and refers students to an intelligent design textbook for more information.
In a separate development Tuesday, two freelance newspaper reporters who covered the school board in June 2004 both invoked their First Amendment rights and declined to provide a deposition to lawyers for the school district.
Both are expected in court Wednesday to respond to a subpoena to testify at trial, said Niles Benn, a lawyer for the papers.
Lawyers for the school district have questioned the accuracy of articles in which the reporters wrote that board members discussed creationism during public meetings.
Patrick Gillen, an attorney with the Thomas More Law Center, said the defense would ask U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III on Wednesday to issue a contempt citation.
In other testimony Tuesday, plaintiff Tammy Kitzmiller said that in January, her younger daughter chose not to hear the intelligent design statement an option given all students putting her in an awkward position.
"My 14 year old daughter had to make the choice between staying in the classroom and being confused ,or she had to be singled out and face the possible ridicule of her friends and classmates," she said.
The Dover district, which serves about 3500 students, is believed to be the nation's first school system to mandate that students be exposed to the intelligent design concept.
The largest US science society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), urged a Pennsylvania federal court Friday to prohibit an anti evolution doctrine known as "intelligent design" in biology classrooms.
The organization and the US National Center for Science Education issued a statement, supporting students' parents to sue the Dover school district, Pennsylvania, against its decision to include " intelligent design," which says life has a God like creator, in the curriculum of ninth grade biology classes.
The school district requires teachers to read a disclaimer prior to a unit on evolution.
The disclaimer says that "intelligent design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin's view."
It also notes that a reference book on intelligent design is available to students.
The parents and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said this policy violates the constitutional separation of church and state, which forbids teaching religion in public schools.
They also argued that intelligent design is unscientific and has no place in a science curriculum.
"The Dover disclaimer brings religion straight into the science classroom," said Alan Leshner, chief executive officer for the AAAS.
It misrepresents the state of knowledge about evolution, he said, and implies that a religious belief has a science base.
And by referring students to a non science text, the disclaimer "surely will confuse them about what is and is not science."
"Intelligent design" holds that nature is so complex it must have been the work of an God like creator rather than the result of natural selection, as argued by Charles Darwin in his 1859 Theory of Evolution.
The Dover school district said there are "gaps" in evolution, which it emphasizes is a theory rather than established fact, and that students have a right to consider other views on the origins of life.
It also argued that it does not teach intelligent design directly but simply makes students aware of its existence as an alternative to evolution.
It denied intelligent design is "religion in disguise", saying it is a scientific theory.
Under the influence of conservative religious groups, educational boards of several states have allowed, or will allow the "intelligent design" doctrine to be taught in basic schools as a rival to the evolution theory.
The Pennsylvanian lawsuit, which is set to begin in a federal court on Sept 26, will become a crucial sign in a new battle against the "intelligent design" movement, according to Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education.
"If the parents win the upcoming case, it will definitely throw sand in the gears of the 'intelligent design' movement," Scott said.
For years, a lawyer for the Thomas More Law Center visited school boards around the country searching for one willing to challenge evolution by teaching intelligent design, and to face a risky, high profile trial.
Intelligent design was a departure for a nonprofit law firm founded by two conservative Roman Catholics one the magnate of Domino's pizza, the other a former prosecutor who until then had focused on the defense of anti abortion advocates, gay rights opponents and the display of Christian symbols like crosses and nativity scenes on government property.
But Richard Thompson, the former prosecutor who is president and chief counsel of the Thomas More Center, says its role is to use the courts "to change the culture" and it well could depending on the outcome of the test case it finally found.
Lawyers for the center are to sum up their case on Friday after a six week trial in which they have been defending the school district in the small Pennsylvania town of Dover.
The school board voted last year to require that students in ninth grade biology class be read a statement saying that "Darwin's theory" is "not a fact" and that intelligent design is an alternative worth studying.
At issue in the Dover lawsuit, brought by 11 parents in U.S. District Court, is whether intelligent design is really religion dressed up as science, and whether teaching it in a public school violates the constitutional separation of church and state.
The More center's lawyers put scientists on the witness stand who contended that intelligent design the idea that living organisms are so complex that the best explanation is that a higher intelligence designed them is a credible scientific theory and not religion because it never identifies God as the designer.
The scientific community generally dismisses intelligent design as pseudoscience, because it cannot be tested by experiment.
Religion is at the heart of the case's appeal for the center, say its lawyers and the chairman of its board.
The chairman, Bowie Kuhn, the former baseball commissioner, said the board agreed that the center should take on an intelligent design case because while it is not necessarily based on religion "it is being opposed because people think it is religious."
And that was enough for a group whose mission, as explained on its Web site, is "to protect Christians and their religious beliefs in the public square."
"America's culture has been influenced by Christianity from the very beginning," Thompson said, "but there is an attempt to slowly remove every symbol of Christianity and religious faith in our country.
This is a very dangerous movement because what will ultimately happen is, out of sight, out of mind."
The legal group was founded in 1999 by Thompson and Thomas Monaghan, the former chief executive of Domino's pizza.
At the time, Thompson had just lost his re election campaign for prosecutor in Oakland County, Mich., defeated by voters disenchanted by his pursuit of Dr Jack Kevorkian, the retired pathologist who attended numerous assisted suicides.
They named the center after the 16th century British politician and author of "Utopia," a critic of Protestantism who was beheaded for his Catholic beliefs and eventually made a saint by his church.
Members of the center's board include Sen Rick Santorum, R Pa., Alan Keyes, a former Republican presidential candidate and talk show host, and Kuhn, the former baseball commissioner.
Monaghan contributed the startup money.
But in recent years the center has been forced to raise its own funds as Monaghan focused his money on building Ave Maria University, a Catholic college in Florida.
In earlier cases, the center defended an enormous cross placed on a hill outside San Diego and nativity scenes in Florida and New York.
It sued the Ann Arbor, Mich., schools for providing benefits for same sex partners.
And in one of its most controversial cases, it defended an anti abortion group that ran an online list of doctors it said should be stopped from providing abortions.
The doctors said the group was threatening them and their families.
Thompson said in an interview it was "a very important free speech case."
To find its first intelligent design case, the lawyers went around the country looking for a school board willing to withstand a lawsuit.
In May 2000, Robert Muise, one of the lawyers, traveled to Charleston, W. Va., to persuade the school board there to purchase the intelligent design textbook "Of Pandas and People" and teach it in science class.
Muise told the board in Charleston that it would undoubtedly be sued if the district taught intelligent design, but that the center would mount a defense at no cost.
"We'll be your shields against such attacks," he told them at a school board meeting, a riff on the center's slogan: "The Sword and Shield for People of Faith."
He said they could defend teaching intelligent design as a matter of academic freedom.
John Luoni, the former president of the Charleston school board, said he remembered listening to Muise and concluding: "It's not really a scientific theory.
It's more of a religious theory.
It should be taught if a church or a denomination believes in it, but I didn't think that religious viewpoint should be taught as part of a science class."
The board in West Virginia declined the center's offer.
So did school districts in Michigan and Minnesota and a handful of other states, Muise and Thompson said.
In Dover, Pa., the firm found willing partners when it contacted the school board in the summer of 2004 and promised it a first class defense, The Dover school board proceeded despite a memo from its lawyer, Stephen S. Russell, warning that if the board lost the case, they would have to pay its opponents legal fees which according to the plaintiffs' lawyers exceeds $1 million.
In the memo, revealed in court on Wednesday, Russell advised that opponents would have a strong case because board members had a lengthy public record of advocating "putting religion back in the schools."
Some of the proponents of intelligent design are also unhappy that the case went to court, and fear it could stop the movement in its infancy because some board members had a public record of advocating creationism, which the Supreme Court has twice ruled cannot be taught in public schools.
"The school district never consulted us and did the exact opposite of what we suggested," said John G. West, a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute, a think tank in the forefront of the intelligent design movement.
"Frankly I don't even know if school board members know what intelligent design is.
They and their supporters are trying to hijack intelligent design for their own purposes.
They think they're sending signals in the culture wars."
Thompson, the Thomas More Center's chief counsel, said the case appealed to him because of its "national impact."
Four months before the trial started, he said, he watched the movie "Inherit the Wind," a drama about the Scopes evolution trial eighty years ago.
"It's only when you take the cases that are on the borderline that you can change the law," he said.
No matter how the Dover case turns out, the center is considering defending several teachers who are defying their school districts by teaching intelligent design.
"We're developing all this expertise in intelligent design," Thompson said.
"We hope to use it."
Michael J. Behe, a biochemistry professor at Lehigh University, has spent the last eight years traveling to colleges across the country promoting "intelligent design" as a challenge to the theory of evolution.
On Monday he brought his lecture and slides to a closely watched trial in federal district court, where a judge will decide whether the town of Dover violated the boundary between church and state when it introduced a statement about intelligent design in a high school biology class.
The Dover school board is being sued by 11 parents who say intelligent design is inappropriate in a biology class because it is merely religious creationism repackaged to resemble science.
Proponents of intelligent design, however, argue that living organisms are so complex that the best explanation is that a higher intelligence designed them.
With the trial starting its fourth week, Behe was the first expert witness called by the defense.
Asked whether intelligent design is religion, or "based on any religious beliefs or convictions," Behe said, "No, it isn't."
"It is based entirely on observable, physical evidence from nature," he said.
Behe said the "best and most striking example of design" is the bacterial flagellum, "the outboard motor bacteria use to swim."
He projected a drawing of a flagellum depicting what he called a "rotary motor" attached to a "drive shaft" that pushes a propeller, and said it is impossible to avoid concluding that the mechanism is "a purposeful arrangement of parts."
Behe is the author of "Darwin's Black Box," a book published in 1996 that spurred the intelligent design movement.
He is also a fellow at the Discovery Institute, a think tank that advocates intelligent design.
For the last three weeks, the plaintiffs have presented a parade of expert witnesses, including a biologist, a theologian, a paleontologist and two philosophers all of whom testified that intelligent design does not meet the definition of science because it cannot be tested or disproved.
They said that intelligent design proponents have not published scientific articles in peer reviewed journals and that most scientists do not question evolution's basic tenets.
Behe testified that intelligent design is science, that it makes "testable scientific claims" and that teaching it "promotes good science education."
Behe testified that intelligent design does not claim to identify the intelligent designer, or even to "require knowledge of the designer."
However, Behe, a Roman Catholic, was asked whether he had concluded that "the designer is God."
He said yes, but added that his conclusion was not based on science.
"I concluded that based on theological, philosophical and historical facts," he said.
When the school board in Muscatine, Iowa, sits down next year for its twice a decade evaluation of the district's science curriculum, the matter of whether to teach intelligent design as a challenge to evolution is expected to come up for discussion.
But board members disagree about whether they will be swayed by a sweeping court decision on intelligent design released Tuesday in Pennsylvania.
A federal judge there declared intelligent design to be "a religious alternative masquerading as a scientific theory" that must not be taught in a public school science class.
"I don't think that a judge in one state is going to be able to tell everybody in all other states what to do," said Paul Brooks, a school board member in Muscatine who favors teaching intelligent design.
The board's vice president, Ann Hart, demurred.
"This determination in Pennsylvania will help the cause," Hart said, "for those of us who think intelligent design should not be taught in public school science classes because of separation of church and state."
Educators and legislators in Muscatine and other communities that are considering intelligent design said they were still just learning about the results of the landmark trial involving the school board in Dover, Pa., and had not read the judge's decision.
The federal district judge in the Pennsylvania case, John E. Jones III, ruled after a six week trial that intelligent design was "an interesting theological argument, but it is not science."
He concluded that it was "unconstitutional to teach ID as an alternative to evolution in a public school science classroom."
The judge's 139 page decision dealt not only with the specific missteps of the Dover school board, but traced the growth of the intelligent design movement from the remnants of creationism and creation science which the Supreme Court declared in 1987 to be unconstitutional to teach in public school science class.
A CITY'S VOTERS WEARY OF THE INTELLIGENT DESIGN SPOTLIGHT Terry Aguayo and Gary Gately contributed reporting for this article.
DOVER, Pa.
In the end, voters in Dover said they were tired of being portrayed as a northern version of Dayton, Tenn., a Bible Belt hamlet where 80 years ago a biology teacher named John Scopes was tried for illegally teaching evolution.
On Tuesday, the residents of Dover ousted all eight school board members running for re election who had put their town in a global spotlight and their school district on trial for being the first in the nation to introduce intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in science class.
In swept the full Dover CARES slate of eight candidates, which had coalesced to oppose the change in the science curriculum.
"I think the people of Dover are tired of the attention over such a miniscule thing, and they want a change," said Lonny Langione, who had served on the school board in years past and supported the challengers.
"A lot of the people I talked to were upset because the school board came to using taxpayer money to advance their own agenda."
Before it took up intelligent design, Dover was a typical American town experiencing typical American growing pains: family farmers selling out to developers, fields sprouting McMansions, overcrowded classrooms, SUVs speeding down roads built for tractors.
By wading into the great reawakening of a national debate over the teaching of evolution, the town of Dover was diverted from bread and butter issues, and found itself divided in surprising ways.
The lines were not neatly drawn.
Christians who belonged to the same church found themselves on opposite sides.
Fathers quarreled with sons.
Next door neighbors posted dueling lawn signs.
Registered Republicans cast their party affiliations aside to run with the victorious Dover CARES slate when election rules forced all eight of its candidates to run on the Democratic line.
Voters themselves crossed party lines to vote for the candidates they favored.
If they had not, the school board incumbents, all of whom ran on the Republican line, probably would have prevailed in a district where 70 percent of voters are registered Republicans.
"It really did pit neighbor against neighbor," said Connie LaCoe, an elementary school teacher who has lived in the community for 30 years.
In the end, the election was close.
Only 26 votes separated the winner of one seat from his rival.
"I'm surprised that we won all eight seats," said the Rev. Warren Eshbach, the spokesman for Dover CARES, whose son, Robert, was among the winning candidates.
"It shows what good bipartisanship can do."
The election came only four days after closing arguments in a six week trial of the Dover school board and administrators in U.S. District Court in Harrisburg, about 25 miles to the northeast.
Eleven parents had sued the Dover board on constitutional grounds, claiming that intelligent design was an outgrowth of religious creationism.
The case will be decided by Judge John E. Jones III, who said he expected to rule by early January.
The majority of voters rejected the school board's argument that they were only trying to expose students to a variety of theories about the development of living organisms.
The policy did not actually tell teachers to teach intelligent design, just to mention it in a four paragraph statement to be read to students.
The statement said that evolution is "not a fact" and that students could explore intelligent design by reading "Of Pandas and People" in the school library.
The debate over Darwin versus intelligent design has played out in places like Myers Barbershop, where the owner, Barry Myers, has been trimming the townspeople's hair for 37 years.
"I just don't think we got here by some big bang," said Myers, who said he voted for the incumbents.
"I think if they have the right people to teach it, it should be taught."
Teaching intelligent design, he said, would help bring a "moral compass" to the classroom.
But his son, Matt Myers, 34, who also works in his father's barbershop, voiced a decidedly different view.
"I'm glad the board's been voted out," he said.
"I don't think science teachers are qualified to teach intelligent design."
He said that intelligent design should be offered as an elective, a position advocated by several Dover CARES candidates.
The campaign was hard fought and at times nasty.
Dover school board members sent out a mass mailing accusing the Dover CARES slate of allying with the American Civil Liberties Union a group, it said in the mailing, that had also defended terrorists and the North American Man/Boy Love Association.
The ACLU is representing the plaintiffs against the Dover board.
"That's the level they were willing to sink to," said Bryan Rehm, who ran with the Dover CARES slate and was also a plaintiff in the lawsuit.
The case will not be affected by the election in the short term, lawyers involved in it said.
The judge must still issue a ruling on the intelligent design policy as it stands.
However, the new school board, which takes office in early December, could decide to revoke the current policy.
Many Dover residents, like Lisa Vilkas, simply want the entire controversy to disappear.
"I just can't wait until it just fizzles," said Vilkas as she sat in a van outside the high school on Wednesday, waiting for two of her daughters.
Compelling biology teachers to present "intelligent design" as an alternative explanation to evolution violates the constitution, a federal judge ruled Tuesday, saying the concept is "an interesting theological argument, but ,not science."
The ruling came after federal District Judge John E. Jones III heard 21 days of testimony during a closely watched six week trial that pitted a group of parents against the school board of the small town of Dover, Pa.
In October 2004, the board had required school officials to read a statement to ninth graders which declared that Charles Darwin's concept of evolution is "a theory ,not a fact" and that "gaps in the theory exist for which there is no evidence."
"Intelligent Design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin's view," the statement said.
Backers of intelligent design argue that biological systems are so complex they could not have arisen by a series of random changes.
The complexity of life implies an intelligent designer, they assert.
Most of the movement's public spokesmen take care not to publicly say whether the designer they have in mind is equivalent to the God of the Bible.
On that basis, they argue that their theory is a scientific one, not religious.
Jones, a church going conservative jurist who was appointed to the federal bench by President Bush in 2002, used much of his 139 page ruling to dissect those claims, rejecting them at every turn.
Legal experts described the ruling as a sharp defeat for the intelligent design movement one likely to have considerable influence with other judges although it has binding legal force only in one section of Pennsylvania.
The school district will not appeal the ruling, said Patricia Dapp, who was elected to the Dover board earlier this year.
The supporters of intelligent design were voted out of office in that election, she said.
At the trial, held in Harrisburg, the state capital, Jones heard testimony from leading advocates of intelligent design as well as experts on evolutionary theory.
The "overwhelming evidence" established that intelligent design "is a religious view, a mere re labeling of creationism, and not a scientific theory," he wrote.
The public statements of school board members, he said, made clear that they adopted the statement in order to advance specific religious views.
Testimony at the trial included statements that at one board meeting, one of the backers of the intelligent design statement had "said words to the effect of '2000 years ago someone died on a cross.
Can't someone take a stand for him?'
" the judge noted.
"Although proponents of the (Intelligent Design Movement) occasionally suggest that the designer could be a space alien or a time traveling cell biologist, no serious alternative to God as the designer has been proposed by members" of the movement, including expert witnesses who testified, Jones wrote.
Statements by the board members that they had only secular purposes in mind to improve science teaching and foster open debate were a "sham," and a "pretext for the board's real purpose, which was to promote religion in the public school classroom," he wrote.
Anticipating attacks, Jones took care to say that his ruling was not the "product of an activist judge."
The judge excoriated the school board officials for lying in their testimony and for not bothering to understand what intelligent design was about before making their decision, Jones said.
He rebuked what he called the "breathtaking inanity of the Board's decision."
"This case came to us as the result of the activism of an ill informed faction on a school board, aided by a national public interest law firm eager to find a constitutional test case" on intelligent design, he wrote.
The Dover trial was one of several battlegrounds for intelligent design in the past year.
Last January, a U.S. District court judge in Georgia ruled that the school system in Cobb County, outside of Atlanta, had violated the Constitution by requiring stickers on biology textbooks which cast doubts on the theory of evolution.
Earlier this month, the federal appeals court in Atlanta considered arguments in that case, with at least one judge expressing strong doubts about the lower court ruling.
In Kansas, the state Board of Education has changed the definition of science to permit supernatural explanations.
That reliance on the supernatural was key to Jones' rejection of the Dover school board's position.
Intelligent design arguments "may be true, a proposition on which this court takes no position," he wrote, but it "is not science."
"The centuries old ground rules of science" make clear that a scientific theory must rely solely on natural explanations that can be tested, he wrote.
(Begin optional trim) That portion of the decision won praise from Kenneth R. Miller, a biology professor at Brown University in Providence, R.I.
He was the lead expert witness for the parents in the case and is the author of biology textbooks used in both college and high school classrooms around the country.
Miller testified that it was critical that scientific propositions be testable.
To illustrate his point, Miller, an avid fan of the Boston Red Sox, testified that when his team beat the New York Yankees in the 2004 baseball playoffs, a fan might have believed "God was tired of (Yankee owner) George Steinbrenner and wanted to see the Red Sox win."
"In my part of the country, you'd be surprised how many people think that's a perfectly reasonable explanation for what happened last year.
And you know what?
It might be true.
But it certainly is not science ,and it's certainly not something we can test," Miller said.
(End optional trim) Supporters of intelligent design quickly denounced Jones' ruling along the lines the judge had predicted.
"The Dover decision is an attempt by an activist federal judge to stop the spread of a scientific idea ,and it won't work," said John West, associate director for the Center for Science and Culture at the Discovery Institute.
The institute, based in Seattle, is a major backer of the intelligent design movement.
"Anyone who thinks a court ruling is going to kill off interest in intelligent design is living in another world," West said.
Richard Thompson, of the Thomas More Law Center, the lead lawyer for the board members called the ruling an "ad hominen attack on scientists who happen to believe in God."
"The founders of this country would be astonished at the thought that this simple curriculum change (was) in violation of the constitution that they drafted," he said.
But Lee Strang, a constitutional law professor at Ave Maria Law School in Ann Arbor, Mich., which advocates a greater role for religion in public life, said that given Supreme Court precedents and the evidence that the Dover school board members had religious goals in mind, Jones ruling was inevitable.
The U.S. Supreme Court in 1987 had barred the teaching of a theory that backers called "creation science" in public schools.
"Intelligent design" emerged as a theory after that ruling, Jones noted in his ruling.
Douglas Laycock of the University of Texas Law School said the ruling was likely to have considerable influence because it came after a trial in which "both sides brought in their top guns" to testify.
The judge's detailed ruling "will be quite persuasive to other judges and lawyers thinking about provoking a similar case elsewhere," he said.
The 20000 residents of the rural Dover school district outside Harrisburg, Pa., won a small victory in court.
But it's a significant decision for science education in public schools nationwide.
Residents of that school district already had taken matters into their own hands by voting in the Nov 9 school board election to oust eight school board members who supported an anti evolution, pro creationism policy.
Tuesday, in an important court decision, U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III ruled that Dover school board members violated the U.S. Constitution with a policy whose real purpose was "to promote religion in the public school classroom."
The Dover policy required ninth grade biology students to listen to a statement that, according to the judge, required teachers to "denigrate or disparage" evolution, to refer to a "religious alternative masquerading as a scientific theory" and to direct them to a "creationist text as though it were a science resource."
The judge, a Republican appointed to the federal bench three years ago, linked the notion of intelligent design in a straight line back to creationism and fundamentalist attacks on evolution in the 1920s.
As such, it is part of "historical and ongoing religiously driven attempts to advance creationism while denigrating evolution."
Advocates have merely recast creationism in scientific sounding language.
At root, noted Jones, is a "contrived dualism" certain fundamentalists believe that people must either believe in evolution or in biblical creationism, in God or in godless science.
Yet evolution takes no position on religion.
As Jones concluded, evolution "in no way conflicts with, nor does it deny, the existence of a divine creator."
Jones made it clear that any objective observer, adult or child, looking at the Dover school district policy could see that it was a creationist, religious strategy that evolved from earlier forms of creationism.
It's possible that the supernatural "intelligent designer" they refer to could be a space alien or a time traveling cell biologist, but everyone knows the designer they refer to is the God of Christianity.
The aim of the intelligent design movement, testified proponents in court, is to change the ground rules of science to include the supernatural.
After an exhaustive examination, Jones stated unequivocally that intelligent design is not science: "While supernatural explanations may be important and have merit, they are not part of science" and have "no place in a science curriculum."
The whole project of relabeling creationism as intelligent design is bad enough.
But school board members also lied, the judge said, time and again "to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose" of their policy.
One board member even lied about his role in collecting donations from his church to buy 60 copies of a creationist book to give to the school district.
Dover's new school board president said the board intends to remove intelligent design from the science curriculum and has no intention of appealing Jones' decision.
That's a good thing, and other school boards should follow Dover's lead in abandoning the curriculum.
Students, parents and teachers deserved better than to be "dragged into this legal maelstrom," the judge said, calling the matter a huge waste of money and time.
He intends to award damages and fees, sending a message to other would be creationists nationwide.
A "creationism in disguise" policy imposes particular religious beliefs on children in public schools, interfering with parents' rights to educate their children as they see fit about religion.
And not only is it bad science, it's not science at all.
The hard fought school election was over, and there was hope that the scars from a nationally watched battle between evolution and intelligent design in public schools would begin to heal at Monday's meeting of the Dover school board.
But bitterness persisted over last week's results, in which eight candidates opposed to the teaching of intelligent design in this rural community narrowly defeated eight incumbents, who had included it as part of the science curriculum.
The clash took place as a federal lawsuit over the board's decision last year was being argued in a court in Harrisburg, north of Dover.
A decision in the case, which pitted the theory of evolution against a rival belief about the origins of life, is expected next month.
"Intelligent design isn't finished here, it isn't finished anywhere," said Alan Bonsell, an outgoing board member, as he left Monday's meeting, his last.
Several hundred people, who filled a school cafeteria, applauded politely when he said the board had "worked hard" to bring Dover students "a much better future."
The eight victors, who sat in a group, had a different message: Bernadette Reinking, a newly elected board member, said in an interview that "Dover needs to heal and put the divisions behind it, because we have to get back to our lives.
We have to let the bitterness die down from this battle and focus on our students."
She added, however, that "nobody ever believed this board should have tried to impose its beliefs on people.
And we're certainly not going to do that now."
The new board, she said, was likely to consider teaching intelligent design in a social studies or philosophy class but not as part of the curriculum in ninth grade biology.
The issue surfaced last year, when the former board voted that a one minute statement about intelligent design should be read in biology classes at Dover High School.
It marked the first time a school board had mandated teaching this belief in a science course.
Proponents of intelligent design believe organisms are too complex to have developed by chance, and that there must have been a "designer" who created life.
Some believe the designer is God, although intelligent design makes no reference to this.
Under the theory of evolution, which is widely taught in public schools, life evolved through a process of natural selection and random mutations.
The theory makes no statement one way or another on the issue of a supernatural agent or divine purpose.
After the board acted, 11 parents sued the Dover Area School District to block the policy, saying intelligent design was a thinly disguised version of "creationism," a Bible based belief about the origins of life.
They contended that teaching intelligent design in science classes would violate the constitutional separation of church and state.
The defendants argued that they placed intelligent design in the ninth grade science curriculum to give students exposure to a variety of viewpoints.
A final decision in the non jury case will be made by U.S. Judge John E. Jones III.
As the trial began in October, the conflict was heating up in the political arena.
Rival slates of candidates were formed over the issue and lawn signs appeared throughout the community, debates in local churches sometimes grew intense.
On election day, partisans on both sides worked furiously to turn out supporters.
Eight seats were at stake, the term of a ninth board member had not expired and was not up for a vote.
"It was a tough political struggle from the beginning," Bonsell said.
"And everybody had their eye on the lawsuit.
It kind of drowned out a lot of other news."
The plaintiffs were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, and a victory could force the Dover school board to pay hefty legal fees.
Fearing such an outcome, one outgoing board member urged his colleagues Monday night to abandon the intelligent design policy, especially in view of the election.
His motion died for lack of a second.
"I am compelled to make this proposal on behalf of the voters, who have spoken," said David Napierskie.
"While I believe in intelligent design, it is clearly in the best interests of our community to move forward,There is sufficient reason to revoke this policy and to try and dismiss the case.
The original lawsuit has become meaningless."
Both sides seemed weary from the political struggle.
In last week's election, the eight victorious Democratic candidates got 21265 votes, the losing Republican side polled 20197 votes.
The outcome was notable in a community where 70 percent of the voters are Republicans, the area voted for President Bush by a 3 to 1 margin.
State Route 74 is the main road into and out of Dover borough, a tidy hamlet of 1800 set in rolling, wooded hills that at this time of year are dressed in the reds and golds of autumn.
It was here, in October 2004, that a school board led by fundamentalist Christians included so called intelligent design in its biology curriculum, launching the latest federal courtroom battle over the place of religion in the classroom, a warfare of ideas that has roiled America's political waters ever since the Scopes "monkey trial" of 1925, and beyond way back to the adoption of the First Amendment.
On Tuesday, Dover Township a larger incorporated area of about 20000 will elect a new school board.
At the northern edge of town on Route 74 stands a billboard that represents the differing positions over science and religion, ideology and theology, that have riven Dover.
On the north side of the billboard is an appeal from the incumbent board: "TAXPAYERS.
Your School Board Puts Dover Independent of ACLU.
VOTE REPUBLICAN."
On the other side is an appeal from the opposing camp, Dover Cares: "Quality Education," it proclaims.
"Common Sense.
Common Cause."
At the trial, which ended Friday after six weeks of testimony, one plaintiff, Julie Smith, told of her daughter coming home from school and saying to her: "Mom, evolution is a lie.
What kind of Christian are you?"
Bryan Rehm, a Dover Cares candidate and one of the 11 parents who have sued the board, said simply: "This community is ready for healing."
Kitzmiller vs. Dover Area School District was the first legal test for intelligent design.
At issue, is whether the policy of the board to incorporate intelligent design into its curriculum was motivated by religious or educational principles.
If either the purpose, or the effect, of a public school policy is religious, it would violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which the Supreme Court has interpreted to mandate a separation of church and state.
The last time the Supreme Court was asked to decide a similar issue was 1987, when Louisiana schools were requiring creationism to be taught alongside Darwinism.
In Edwards vs. Aguillard, the court struck that state law.
Intelligent design supporters maintain that Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, which underpins the position that man is descended from apes, cannot fully explain the origin of complex forms of life, thus, a higher intelligence must have designed them.
Opponents of intelligent design say the theory is a means to introduce religion into the classroom and lacks scientific evidence.
The trial, held in Harrisburg, about 20 miles north of Dover, in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III, was the first time a court has been asked to decide whether intelligent design can be taught in public schools.
Many consider it the most important challenge to evolutionary science in many years.
It attracted international media attention.
Paramount Pictures sent a representative to the courtroom.
The New Yorker magazine staffed it, as did Harper's Magazine, whose story is being written by Matthew Chapman, who happens to be the great great grandson of Charles Darwin.
At issue was a four paragraph statement adopted by the Dover school board, which was read to ninth grade biology students as they begin to study the theory of evolution and which says: "Because Darwin's Theory is a theory, it continues to be tested ,The Theory is not a fact.
Gaps exist in the Theory for which there is no evidence ,Intelligent Design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin's view ,Students are encouraged to keep an open mind."
The Dover board is defended by the Thomas More Law Center of Michigan, a nonprofit firm founded by two conservative Roman Catholics, whose Web site states: "Our purpose is to be the sword and shield for people of faith ,to defend and protect Christians and their religious beliefs in the public square."
Intelligent design is science, defendants say, because the "irreducible complexity" of some aspects of the natural world cannot be accounted for otherwise.
The plaintiffs, whose attorneys include Witold J. Walczak, of the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, argued that intelligent design is creationism in pseudoscientific garb.
They pointed to what has become known as the "wedge document," a memo prepared by the Discovery Institute, a Seattle based think tank that has been at the forefront of attacking Darwinism for promoting atheism and destroying cultural and moral values.
The "wedge document" appeared on the Web in 1999, and promises to stifle scientific materialism, replacing it with "a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions."
Intelligent design, the memo said, "will function as a wedge" in that struggle.
In court, the plaintiffs quoted from two versions of a textbook, "Of Pandas and People."
One version predates the Supreme Court's 1987 decision in the Louisiana creationism case, the other came after that landmark ruling and is now available in Dover school libraries.
The pre 1987 text said: "Creation means that various forms of life began abruptly through the agency of an intelligent creator, with their distinctive features already intact fish with fins, birds with feathers, beaks and wings, etc." The newer edition states: "Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly though an intelligent agent ," "When we talk about an intelligent designer," argued plaintiffs' attorney Eric J. Rothschild, "with the ability to design and create and build biological life, we are talking about God,Science has no way of proving or measuring supernatural or divine action."
Both sides agree that Judge Jones' decision will have far reaching implications.
"This is the World Series and Oscars and Nobel Prize of the evolution biz all wrapped into one," said Eugenie Scott, the executive director of the Oakland based National Center for Science Education, who travels the country defending evolution and who played a crucial role in assembling what she calls "a dream team" of expert witnesses for the plaintiffs.
"The results will be extremely significant for American public schools," Scott said.
"If the judge rules for the district, I think this will give a green light to school districts across the country that would like to introduce some form of creationism in the classroom."
In a November Gallup poll, only 35 percent of those polled "believed confidently" that Darwin's theory was "supported by the evidence," whereas 45 percent believed that "God created man in his present form."
Richard Thompson, president of the Thomas More Law Center and chief counsel for the Dover board, agrees with Scott.
"Intelligent design is now being adopted by a number of credible scientists," he said.
"If the Dover school district wins this case, you're going to see intelligent design popping up on school board agendas all over the country."
The lead scientific witness for the board was Dr Michael Behe, a biochemistry professor at Lehigh University and author of "Darwin's Black Box," who testified that "the appearance of design in aspects of biology is overwhelming.
Intelligent design is based on observed, empirical, physical evidence from nature."
Behe asserted, as an example, that "scientific literature has no answers to the question of the origin of the immune system."
Under cross examination, the professor whose science faculty colleagues at Lehigh University have issued a statement supporting evolutionary theory as established science was surrounded by stacks of biology and medical texts and peer reviewed journals piled there by plaintiffs' attorney Rothschild, who pointed out that all the writings discussed the evolution of the immune system.
But in his three days of testimony, Behe did not budge.
A second defense witness, Dr Scott Minnich, a microbiologist at the University of Idaho, testified that "intelligent design is a good paradigm, consistent with the empirical evidence."
But, he complained: "It's almost like you're a heretic," if you hold such views.
Intelligent design has been repudiated by the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the National Academy of Sciences, the two leading professional organizations in the field.
Minnich acknowledged that the "intelligent agent is the God of Christianity," but insisted that he didn't "mix religion with science."
He offered as an example of intelligent design bacterial flagellum, which he described as "a true rotary motor," with a propeller, a universal joint, rings and a drive shaft.
Because the flagellum cannot function without all its parts, he argued, random selection cannot account for its creation.
Because of its "irreducible complexity," it is "the system that will make or break intelligent design," he said.
The chief scientific witness for the plaintiffs, Kenneth Miller, said that he, too, was "a person of faith,I'm a Roman Catholic."
He is also a Brown University biologist and co author of one of the most widely used high school textbooks "Biology," which is the primary text employed in Dover Senior High School.
Miller testified that, "If you invoke a non natural cause, a spirit force or something like that in your research, I have no way to test it.
So even if you are correct ,that really wouldn't be a part of science."
"The statement by the Dover board of education falsely undermines the scientific status of the theory of evolution," he said, "and does a great disservice to science education in Dover."
The Dover school district's science teachers, who opposed including intelligent design in the curriculum, refused to read the statement, which had to be read instead by an administrator.
The original version contained a sentence suggested by the teachers: "Darwin's theory of evolution is the dominant scientific explanation of the origin of species."
But the school board edited that out.
Perhaps the most anticipated witness at the trial was William Buckingham, who as the chairman of the Dover district curriculum committee last fall, had spearheaded the adoption of the intelligent design statement.
It was Buckingham, a former prison supervisor and member of an independent fundamentalist church, who cried out at a board meeting: "Two thousand years ago somebody died on a cross.
Can't someone take a stand for him?"
Under cross examination, Buckingham acknowledged there were times his testimony contradicted statements he had made earlier in sworn depositions, but said his memory was faulty because he was "addicted to OxyContin," a prescription opiate, and had twice been in rehabilitation.
Both Buckingham and the former school board president, Alan Bonsell, who were the leading advocates for the change, acknowledged in testimony that they believe the book of Genesis is literally true.
This week, Bonsell acknowledged that he had earlier testified untruthfully when he claimed not to know where money was raised to donate 60 copies of "Of Pandas and People" to the school library.
The money had been raised in Buckingham's church and funneled through Bonsell's father, so the books could be donated anonymously.
Hearing that, the usually affable Judge Jones lost patience.
Red faced and visibly angry, he took over examining Bonsell himself, peppering him with questions for 10 minutes.
"You tell me why you didn't say Mr Buckingham was involved," he demanded.
Then, later in the week, he snapped at one of the board's lawyers: "Don't insult my intelligence."
Both sides were exquisitely attuned to Jones' moods and interests, because they had agreed to a bench trial a trial without a jury which is common in First Amendment cases where the arguments are mostly about legal rather than factual issues.
"Thank God" it's a bench trial, said the National Center for Science Education's Scott, who joked she's called an atheist so often she thinks it's her first name Atheist Eugenie Scott.
"There's no way on God's green earth we'd get the verdict we want from a jury."
The judge was appointed to the bench by President Bush.
He had been a fundraiser for both Bush presidents, and served former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge in a number of capacities.
The Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, which collects anonymous quotes from lawyers about judges, describes him as able, and balanced between plaintiffs and defendants.
One lawyer had this to say: "He is willing to give due consideration to new and different approaches.
That is refreshing.
He is willing to do the intellectually challenging work.
He is a proactive judge."
And a witty one.
There had been testimony that some creationists believe the Earth was created in seven days, as described in Genesis, with geological formations such as the Grand Canyon resulting from the flood described in the story of Noah and his arc.
The Earth, they believe, is no more than 10000 years old, whereas the accepted scientific view places its age at 4.5 billion years, "give or take a year," as one of the plaintiffs' lawyers remarked.
When, on the final day of the trial, one lawyer pointed out that, "this is the 40th day of the trial, and tonight will be the 40th night," Jones replied: "That's an interesting coincidence.
But it was not by design."
Jones said it was his "strong desire to get the case decided this year."
He may issue a narrow opinion limited to the specific facts of the Dover case.
Or he may make a broader ruling on the constitutionality of teaching intelligent design in public school classrooms.
Regardless of how he rules, this trial was the beginning of what will be a protracted battle in the courts sought by Christian conservatives such as defense lawyer Thompson.
"We're preparing our case for an ultimate review by the Supreme Court of the United States," Thompson said.
He added that President Bush's nomination of Samuel Alito to fill a vacant seat on the high court is "absolutely" encouraging.
Senators of both parties who have been meeting with Alito reported he told them he believed the court might have gone too far in separating church and state.
On the night the trial ended, Theatre Harrisburg opened a new production of "Inherit the Wind," about the Scopes trial, in which Clarence Darrow, arguing for a science teacher who taught evolution in defiance of state law, was defeated by William Jennings Bryan.
That timing, too, was a coincidence.
WASHINGTON A federal judge in Pennsylvania Tuesday ruled that intelligent design is "nothing less than the progeny of creationism" and should not be taught in public schools.
The ruling, handed down by a judge appointed by President Bush, is a major legal setback for proponents of intelligent design, which holds that living organisms are so complex they cannot be explained by evolution and must be the work of a higher power.
Christian right leaders have argued that it should be taught in school systems across the country.
The ruling, the first legal test of intelligent design, comes after a six week trial in which expert witnesses and parents on both sides of the dispute took the stand to argue their positions on a Dover, Pa., school board policy requiring science teachers to inform students of "gaps" in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and to share competing views, including intelligent design.
Intelligent design proponents, mindful of legal barriers against teaching creationism in public schools, have long argued that their theory passes constitutional muster because it is not based in religion.
They use the term "intelligent designer," rather than God, to describe an omniscient force behind life on earth, and they draw on a pool of scientists to raise questions that they say Darwin's theory fails to answer.
But in a sweeping 139 page opinion that went far beyond the legality of the Dover policy, Judge John E. Jones III concluded that intelligent design is religious and that its inclusion in public school violates the constitutional separation of church and state.
The ruling rebuked prominent intelligent design theorists, saying their assertion that evolution cannot coexist with religious beliefs is "utterly false."
Jones also harshly condemned the Dover school board members who backed it.
Those school officials, Jones charged, "time and again lie d to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose" behind promoting the theory of intelligent design, which he said was to promote religion.
Jones is a lifelong Republican who ran for Congress and narrowly lost more than a decade ago.
He has described his mentor as Tom Ridge, the former Pennsylvania governor who served as homeland security secretary.
Bush appointed Jones to the bench in 2002.
It's unlikely the decision will be appealed because a newly elected Dover school board now opposes intelligent design.
Lawyers for the 11 parents who sued the school district say Jones's decision sends a warning to other school districts considering including intelligent design in their curricula.
"Although this is a decision by one district court, it is a carefully reasoned and highly detailed decision that goes through all the issues that will come up in any school district," said plaintiff lawyer Richard B. Katskee of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
Jay D. Wexler, a Boston University law professor who has written scholarly articles on intelligent design, said that while the ruling is limited to one district, "the decision is so extremely broad and negative towards intelligent design that I do think it will have some chilling effect" on school districts considering ways to cast doubt on evolution.
But John West, senior fellow of the Seattle based Discovery Institute, a leading promoter of intelligent design, predicted that the ruling will spark renewed interest in the theory.
"Americans don't like to be told what to think about and what to study," he said, adding that "intelligent design ultimately will rise or fall on scientific evidence."
"This judge obviously thought he had this important place in history, so why not get up on his soap box," West added.
"But he failed as a matter of law."
Citing both scientists appearing at the trial and leading authors on intelligent design, the Pennsylvania judge repeatedly referred to intelligent design's "religious nature and aspirations."
"Although proponents of intelligent design occasionally suggest that the designer could be a space alien or a time travelling cell biologist, no serious alternative to God as the designer has been proposed," Jones wrote.
"It is notable that not one defense expert was able to explain how the supernatural action suggested by ID could be anything other than an inherently religious proposition."
This fall's trial inside a Harrisburg, Pa., courtroom drew comparisons to the famed 1925 Scopes trial, in which evolutionary theory was pitted against Christian fundamentalism in the trial of a Tennessee teacher who defied a state law by teaching evolution.
Like the Scopes trial, the Dover case spilled over into the political arena.
Senator Rick Santorum, a conservative Pennsylvania Republican and member of the Senate leadership, has said that intelligent design is a "legitimate scientific theory that should be taught in science classes."
President Bush fanned the fires in August when he told a group of Texas newspaper reporters that he thought intelligent design should be taught alongside evolution as competing theories.
And in November, after Dover voters bounced eight of the nine school board members supporting intelligent design out of office, televangelist Pat Robertson warned residents that "if there is a disaster in your area, don't turn to God, you just rejected Him from your city."
In 1968 the Supreme Court struck down an Arkansas ban on the teaching of evolution.
Subsequent attempts to inject creationism back into the classroom including "balanced treatment" statutes that required creationism to be taught alongside evolution have also been blocked by courts.
The Discovery Institute, the most prominent proponent of intelligent design, had distanced itself from the Dover school board's action because it supports the voluntary, not mandated, teaching of intelligent design in classrooms.
"We were queasy about" the Dover school board action, said West, because it went too far.
The Discovery Institute and other intelligent design proponents are hoping for a more favorable outcome for school policies that cast doubt on evolution but don't mandate teaching alternative theories.
In particular, the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit is expected to hand down a ruling soon over a requirement that biology books in Cobb County, Georgia carry stickers stating that evolution is "a theory, not a fact."
The Discovery Institute also supported a Kansas school board policy, adopted last month, that injects language that is critical of evolution into statewide standards.
Nevertheless, the Pennsylvania district court's broad assault on intelligent design was widely viewed as a serious setback for its proponents.
The judge repeatedly cited the "religious" nature of intelligent design writings, and quoted a Discovery Institute document stating that the intelligent design's governing goals are to "defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies" and to "replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God."
Jones also chastised the Dover school board members who embraced intelligent design "despite a collective failure to understand" the theory and in the face of "consistent and unwelcome advice from the District's science teachers who uniformly opposed the change."
The only outside groups consulted were the Discovery Institute and another intelligent design group "and it is clear that these contacts was to obtain legal advice, as opposed to science education information."
The nation's first trial to test the constitutionality of teaching intelligent design as science ended Friday with a lawyer for the pro design Dover school board pronouncing it "the next great paradigm shift in science."
His opponent, an attorney for the 11 parents suing the school board, dismissed intelligent design as dishonest, unscientific and based entirely on "a meager little analogy that collapses immediately upon inspection."
The conclusion of the six week long trial in U.S. District Court on Friday made it clear that two separate but interconnected entities are actually on trial: the Dover school board and the fledgling intelligent design movement.
The board in Dover, a growing town south of Harrisburg, voted last year to read to ninth grade biology students a four paragraph statement saying that there are "gaps" in the theory of evolution, and that intelligent design is an alternative they should explore.
At the trial, board members repeatedly said they wanted to "encourage critical thinking."
But the parents presented evidence that the board's purpose was religious and that the intelligent design statement was a compromise they settled for after learning they could not teach creationism.
On another level were dueling scientists: those who argued that intelligent design is an exciting new explanation, versus those who testified that it does not deserve to be called science.
The case will be decided by Judge John E. Jones III, who said he hopes to issue his ruling before the end of the year, or early January at the latest.
The scientists who advocate intelligent design explained that the complexity of biological organisms and the "purposeful arrangement of parts" are evidence that there is a designer.
They said their theory is not religious because they are not claiming the designer is God, since that is untestable.
In his blunt closing argument, the plaintiffs' lawyer, Eric Rothschild, accused the intelligent design movement of lying just like he said the school board members had lied when they testified that their purpose for changing the science curriculum had nothing to do with religion.
A lawyer for the school board, Patrick Gillen, said in closing arguments that while some board members had strong religious beliefs, neither their "primary purpose" nor the effect of their policy was to advance religion.
One question now is whether the judge will base his ruling more narrowly on the specific actions of the Dover board, or more broadly on the permissibility of teaching intelligent design in public school science classes.
The exploits of seven times Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong, who is alleged to have used the banned blood booster EPO (erythropoietin) in 1999, are also down to the use of other banned substances according to one expert.
Alessandro Donati, a specialist in the fight against doping in sport, suggested the performances of the 33 year old American appear to show he has used a range of banned substances, including anabolic steroids.
Armstrong, who retired after his seventh yellow jersey victory last month, has always denied ever taking banned substances, and has been on a major defensive since a report by French newspaper L'Equipe last week showed details of doping test results from the Tour de France in 1999.
The paper alleged Armstrong had tested positive six times for EPO in that year's race.
At the time the test for EPO did not exist and testing on the samples from 1999 only began in 2004.
Donati said he was not at all surprised to read the damaging report about Armstrong and even claimed the now retired American is just one of hundreds of professional cyclists who are dealing with danger.
"During the past few years there have been clear indications as to how Armstrong has been so successful," Donati, who was formerly in charge of the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) research centre, told German weekly Die Zeit to appear Thursday.
EPO, a naturally occurring hormone which is also synthetically produced, has been the scourge of endurance sports for over 15 years due to its capacity to increase the volume of oxygen rich red blood cells in the blood.
He added: "No one could achieve what Armstrong has achieved taking EPO on its own.
EPO improves your breathing capacity.
But you also need other substances, such as anabolics, testosterone and a lot of others.
"A lot of riders take whatever they can get their hands on, I mean everything, to go faster than the next guy."
Donati, who has a background specialising in athletics, became known in the anti doping world in 1994 for creating a file on the top level athletes and their doctors in particular in the world of cycling who had been caught up in doping affairs.
He added: "Cycling is still a victim of widespread doping.
It is caught in the jaws of doping because tactics in cycling plays a very minor role.
What you need absolutely most of all is sheer physical strength."
Donati however criticised L'Equipe newspaper for its moralistic stance towards the American.
L'Equipe is owned by Amaury Sports Organisation, which is also the mother company which runs the Tour de France.
"The documents printed by L'Equipe are very damaging but also unquestionable.
But the paper's own position is much less clear," said Donati.
"Newspapers who report on cycling shouldn't be organising races, especially the Tour de France.
"It the same with the Tour of Italy, which is practically run by the Gazzetta dello Sport (newspaper)."
The head of USA Cycling defended Lance Armstrong on Friday, saying that new doping charges were unfair and lacked credibility.
The French newspaper L'Equipe reported Tuesday that traces of the performance enhancing drug EPO had been found in frozen samples of Armstrong's urine from 1999, the year he won the first of seven Tour de France titles.
But Gerard Bisceglia, the chief executive of USA Cycling, said the report was flawed because it was based on the testing of only B samples of Armstrong's urine.
The A samples, which were destroyed in 1999, also must be tested for a valid result, Bisceglia said.
"Our stance is there are protocols and procedures that are well defined and laid out in the WADA, USADA codes," he said in a telephone interview, referring to the World Anti Doping Agency and the U.S. Anti Doping Agency.
"We religiously adhere to those policies.
"We are adamantly against doping in the sport.
We also have a responsibility and obligation to look out for the rights of our riders and members.
In this particular case, our rider has been denied due process."
Bisceglia said he decided to speak out after reading statements from officials of the World Anti Doping Agency and the Tour de France who supported the L'Equipe report.
L'Equipe quoted the Tour de France director, Jean Marie Leblanc, as saying, "For the first time and these are no longer rumors, or insinuations, these are proven scientific facts someone has shown me that in 1999, Armstrong had a banned substance called EPO in his body."
According to The Associated Press, Dick Pound, the head of the World Anti Doping Agency, said the lab that recorded the positive tests was accredited by the International Olympic Committee.
L'Equipe reported that the samples belonged to Armstrong, a claim the lab would not confirm.
"You can count on the fingers of one hand the times a B sample has not confirmed the result of the A sample," Pound was quoted as saying.
"It's almost always a delaying tactic."
Bisceglia said his main complaint was that Armstrong would not have the opportunity to prove his innocence because of the absence of an A sample.
"When people start using comments like, 'irrefutable scientific evidence,' that's a pretty strong statement to make," Bisceglia said, "when the person you're making it about has never been given the opportunity to refute the statement.
"You're making claims about something that took place in 1999.
Based on what I've read, it's pretty clear that any opportunity to have a black and white resolution to this case has been destroyed."
Bisceglia said USA Cycling, the governing body for the sport in the United States, would not look into the L'Equipe report.
Typically, the organization takes action in doping cases only when guilt has been proven, he said.
"I don't think this is going to become anything more than a news story," Bisceglia said.
A University of Texas scientist is coming to the defense of Lance Armstrong amid allegations that the Tour de France champion used a banned substance to help him win in 1999.
Ed Coyle, director of UT's Human Performance Laboratory, studied the physiology of Armstrong from 1992 to 1999.
He said Thursday that Armstrong's record victory streak and the edge he has on other cyclists can be explained by science and not the taking of erythropoietin, or EPO, the blood booster reportedly found in his urine samples from 1999.
Coyle, a nutritional adviser to the International Olympic Committee and a former editor of the International Journal of Sports Medicine, concluded that the cycling champion showed an 18 percent improvement during the seven years he studied Armstrong by significantly increasing his slow twitch muscle fibers, losing body mass and taking a modern approach to a sport that embraces obsolete training ideas.
"Again, before searching for explanations in conspiracy and cheating, you should first look at human nature for signs of ignorance and difficulty with change," Coyle said via e mail Thursday.
Earlier this summer, Coyle published his observations of Armstrong in the June edition of "The Journal of Applied Physiology."
European reporters have searched out Coyle this week to comment on the report in the Paris newspaper L'Equipe that alleged Armstrong tested positive for EPO six times in 1999.
The newspaper reported that a laboratory outside Paris had tested the frozen Tour de France urine samples and that documents link six of the positive tests to Armstrong.
Armstrong took the offensive after the stories were published, stating that in 1999 "when I gave those samples, there was not EPO in those samples.
I guarantee that."
The samples tested were all B, or backup, specimens.
The A tests were discarded after testing in 1999.
There is now nothing left to retest.
"They've put Lance in Pandora's Box," said Bill Stapleton, Armstrong's attorney.
"And he can't defend himself."
Coyle said none of the physiological changes that led to Armstrong's seven victories could be linked to a use of an illegal chemical.
EPO is a drug legally prescribed for patients with kidney problems and those undergoing chemotherapy.
The substance helps build oxygen carrying red blood cells.
Cyclists and cross country skiers have illegally used EPO to better endurance, but Coyle estimated that taking the drug gives someone only a 3 percent to 5 percent improvement in performance.
Cyclists who use EPO inject the drug during training and not during racing, which is why the World Anti Doping Agency has been focusing so much attention on out of competition testing.
Armstrong told the Austin American Statesman on Thursday that he has donated "close to six figures" of his own salary to the international cycling federation for the specific use of bettering a test for EPO.
He was the focus of six out of competition tests earlier this year, he said.
Armstrong estimated that he's been tested at least 300 times in his seven year winning streak.
"We have seven years of 'A' and 'B' samples," Armstrong said.
"They've all been negative."
During Coyle's seven year study, Armstrong dropped 15 pounds and trained hard enough to increase the percentage of slow twitch muscle fibers in his body from 60 percent to 80 percent.
Typically, the best endurance athletes are naturally blessed with more slow twitch fibers, which need less energy to function at a high level for long periods of time.
Most cyclists are in the 60 percent range while non athletes are between 40 and 50 percent.
"I'm certain these improvements have nothing to do with blood or EPO, but are due simply to seven years of training and a modest diet in the spring months before the Tour de France," Coyle said.
Coyle also said Armstrong's two main rivals Germany's Jan Ullrich and Italy's Ivan Basso do not come into the Tour with the same conditioning as Armstrong.
Ullrich, the 1997 champion, usually comes into the Tour overweight and is at his best in the race's final week.
Basso, who finished second to Armstrong this July, rode the three week Giro d'Italia in May, which may have sapped his strength.
"What I'm saying is that Armstrong's European competitors are beating themselves by entering the race tired and unprepared to climb," Coyle said.

The French sports newspaper L'Equipe charged Tuesday that Lance Armstrong used an illegal performance enhancing drug in 1999 to win his first of seven consecutive Tours.
"Lance Armstrong has used EPO," the banned erythropoietin, to increase the red blood corpuscles that carry oxygen to muscles, the newspaper stated in a four page report that began with a front page headline, "The Armstrong Lie."
The 33 year old Armstrong, who retired on July 24 after his latest victory, strongly denied the charge.
But Jean Marie Leblanc, the director of the Tour de France, called the newspaper's report "very complete, very professional, very meticulous."
He said on RTL radio that the charge "appears credible."
Leblanc added that disciplinary action seemed unlikely since the tests were based on only the second, or B, urine sample taken during the race.
The A sample was tested in 1999 but was not frozen.
No tests for EPO were available in 1999.
Armstrong has been under suspicion and investigated a handful of times since his comeback in 1999 from testicular cancer, but has never been found guilty of doping.
"Unfortunately, the witch hunt continues," he said on his Web site, adding that the "article is nothing short of tabloid journalism."
He added, "I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance enhancing drugs."
The tests were done at the Chatenay Malabry laboratory outside Paris last year, the specialist doping facility confirmed.
The urine samples were tested in 2004 to help scientists refine EPO detection methods, the paper said.
The lab confirmed that it had conducted the tests, but said it could not confirm that the samples were Armstrong's because the labels were identified only by six digit labels.
L'Equipe said it had decoded the labels by matching each sample with forms filed with the French Cycling Federation during the tour.
Those forms, filled out each time a sample was taken in a drug test, identified the donor by name as well as the six digits on his urine sample.
L'Equipe reproduced both what it said were the results of the laboratory's tests, with sample number, and the forms with the same number and Armstrong's name.
L'Equipe, which said it conducted "a long, painstaking and rigorous investigation," reproduced what it said were EPO tests of frozen urine samples taken from riders during the 1999 Tour.
Doctors commonly store blood, urine and other samples so they can do tests that may become necessary or available years after the samples were taken.
They usually compare those tests with control samples to make sure that freezing or other storage techniques do not distort the findings.
In a drug test, for example, they might compare a suspect sample of stored blood with one that contained no drugs.
Six samples that the paper said were taken from Armstrong proved positive for the "indisputable" use of EPO, the paper said.
It added that six other samples from riders who were not identified had also proven positive.
"It cannot be regarded as a positive test in the strict regulatory sense," the newspaper said, doubting that French sanctions were likely.
L'Equipe said the World Antidoping Agency or the U.S. Antidoping Agency could act, but that appears unlikely even if the charges were further substantiated.
French sports minister Jean Francois Lamour told the Associated Press that because the A sample was disposed of after the initial 1999 testing, the B sample would not be enough to pursue charges and punishment.
The sample also pre dates the formation of the World Anti Doping Agency, which was launched in 2000 to administer Olympic drug testing worldwide, as well as the U.S. Anti Doping Agency, also started in 2000.
"If anything were found, we couldn't do anything because we didn't even exist in 1999," said the WADA chairman, Richard Pound.
Still, Pound encouraged the International and U.S. cycling federations to look into the allegations, saying, "it's important that the truth must always be made clear."
Clarity, though, may be illusive.
There was no worldwide standard on freezing samples until 2004, when the WADA code was adopted by most countries to govern such matters.
And the reliability of the urine test for EPO, first used in 2000, has been a source of concern.
USA Cycling spokesman Andy Lee said the organization would have no comment.
As he continued to win the Tour de France year in and year out, Armstrong has occasionally been the target of doping suspicions in L'Equipe, which is owned by the same company that owns the Tour de France the Amaury Sports Organisation and works out of the same building.
Miguel Indurain of Spain, who won the Tour five times in the 1990s, was quoted on the Web site todociciclismo.com on Tuesday as saying, "They have been out to get him in France for a number of years."
The continuing suspicions have embroiled Armstrong in at least four court suits that are still to be heard.
In what seems to be the biggest one, he is suing The Sunday Times of London for reprinting doping charges made in a book, "L.A. Confidential, the Secrets of Lance Armstrong," in 2004.
The other cases involve an Italian rider, a former personal assistant who, like Armstrong, is a Texan, and an American insurance company that has refused to pay a bonus of several million dollars to the rider because of its doubts about his Tour victory two years ago.
In the month since he retired, Armstrong has been spending his time with his three children, with his companion, the singer Sheryl Crow, and with work for his foundation to combat cancer.
On Saturday, he visited President Bush's ranch and rode with him on mountain bikes across the Texas landscape.
Armstrong is a member of the President's Council on Cancer and has pressed him for more research funds.
The editor of French sports daily L'Equipe denied Tuesday that his paper accused Lance Armstrong of doping because he is American.
"If Lance Armstrong was a French rider and we were in possession of the same information we would have done the same thing," Claude Droussent told France's LCI television station.
L'Equipe reported last week that Armstrong used the banned performance enhancing drug EPO to help win the 1999 Tour de France the first of his seven straight titles.
Armstrong responded by vehemently denying the accusations and claiming he is the victim of a "witch hunt."
On Aug 23, L'Equipe reported that it had evidence that six of Armstrong's urine samples from the '99 Tour tested positive for EPO.
The substance was banned but there was no reliable test at the time.
Scientists used 'B' samples last year while researching testing techniques, but the 'A' samples had been used up.
"Because of what we have revealed ,it casts discredit on the rest of his (Armstrong's) career," Droussent said.
The UCI, or the International Cycling Union, said Monday it would investigate reports of positive drug tests at the '99 Tour and issue its findings within 10 days.
Armstrong has said he is considering whether to take the newspaper, France's national anti doping laboratory, and Tour race director Jean Marie Leblanc to court.
Lance Armstrong went on the offensive Wednesday, saying it was "preposterous" for the director of the Tour de France to suggest the seven time champion "fooled" race officials and the sporting world by doping.
He also took to task the French newspaper that accused him, the laboratory that released the urine samples in question and any officials of the Tour and sports ministries involved in putting the story together.
"Where to start?"
Armstrong mused during a conference call from Washington, D.C., when asked what he found most objectionable about the controversy.
"This has been a long, love hate relationship between myself and the French."
L'Equipe reported Tuesday that six urine samples Armstrong provided during his first tour win in 1999 tested positive for the red blood cell booster EPO.
On Wednesday, tour director Jean Marie Leblanc sounded convinced that Armstrong had been caught.
"For the first time and these are no longer rumors, or insinuations, these are proven scientific facts someone has shown me that in 1999, Armstrong had a banned substance called EPO in his body," Leblanc told the newspaper.
"The ball is now in his court.
Why, how, by whom?
He owes explanations to us and to everyone who follows the Tour.
Today, what L'Equipe revealed shows me that I was fooled.
We were all fooled."
The Tour did not respond Wednesday to a request by The Associated Press to interview Leblanc.
But Armstrong said he had talked with him by phone.
"I actually spoke to him for about 30 minutes and he didn't say any of that stuff to me personally," Armstrong said.
"But to say that I've 'fooled' the fans is preposterous.
I've been doing this a long time.
We have not just one year of only 'B' samples, we have seven years of 'A' and 'B' samples.
They've all been negative."
Armstrong questioned the validity of testing samples frozen seven years ago and how those samples were handled since.
He also charged officials at the suburban Paris laboratory with violating World Anti Doping Agency code for failing to safeguard the anonymity of any remaining 'B' samples it had.
"It doesn't surprise me at all that they have samples.
Clearly they've tested all of my samples since then to the highest degree.
But when I gave those samples," he said, referring to 1999, "there was not EPO in those samples.
I guarantee that."
Armstrong saved his most withering criticism for L'Equipe.
"Obviously, this is great business for them.
Unfortunately, I'm caught in the cross hairs."
A moment later, he added, "I think they've been planning it for a while.
I think they much would have preferred to have done this at start of the Tour, or the middle, but for some reason, it was delayed.
"At the end of day, I think that's what it's all about ,selling newspapers.
"And," he added, "it sells."
L'Equipe, linked to the Tour de France through its parent company, has often raised questions about Armstrong and doping.
On Tuesday, the banner headline of its four page report was "The Armstrong Lie."
Armstrong was in Washington for a previously scheduled meeting with sponsors.
He said their support was intact and that he was considering legal action to discover who leaked the details.
"In the meantime, it would cost a million and a half dollars and a year of my life.
I have a lot better things to do with the million and a half ,a lot better things I can do with my time.
Ultimately, I have to ask myself that question."
Fellow cyclists came to Armstrong's defense Wednesday.
"Armstrong always told me that he never used doping products," five time winner Eddy Merckx told Le Monde newspaper.
"Choosing between a journalist and Lance's word, I trust Armstrong."
Five time champion Miguel Indurain said he couldn't understand why scientists would use samples from the '99 Tour for their tests.
"I feel the news is in bad taste and out of place, given that it happened six years ago after his first tour victory, and after he won six more," Indurain wrote in the Spanish sports daily Marca.
"With the little I have to go on, it is difficult to take a position, but I think at this stage there's no sense in stirring all this up."
EPO, formally known as erythropoietin, was on the list of banned substances when Armstrong won his first Tour, but there was no effective test to detect the drug, which builds endurance by boosting the production of oxygen rich red blood cells.
The allegations took six years to surface because EPO tests on the 1999 samples were carried out only last year, when scientists at the national doping test lab opened them up for research to perfect EPO screening.
L'Equipe's investigation was based on the second set of two samples.
The first set was used up during analysis in 1999, without it, disciplinary action against Armstrong would be impossible.
French Sports Minister Jean Francois Lamour said he had doubts about L'Equipe's report because he had not seen the originals of some of the documents it cited.
"I do not confirm it," he told RTL radio.
But he added: "If what L'Equipe says is true, I can tell you that it's a serious blow for cycling."
Jacques de Ceaurriz, the head of France's anti doping laboratory, told Europe 1 radio that at least 15 urine samples from the 1999 Tour had tested positive for EPO.
The year before, there were more than 40 positive samples, he said reflecting how widespread the drug was when riders thought they could not be caught.
The lab said it could not confirm that the positive results cited in L'Equipe were Armstrong's.
It noted that the samples were anonymous, bearing only a six digit number to identify the rider, and could not be matched with any one cyclist.
However, L'Equipe said it was able to confirm the samples were Armstrong's by matching the cyclist's medical certificates with the results of positive doping tests bearing the same sample numbers.
Armstrong has insisted throughout his career that he has never taken drugs to enhance his performance.
In his autobiography, "It's Not About the Bike," he said he was administered EPO during his chemotherapy treatment to battle cancer.
"It was the only thing that kept me alive," he wrote.
AP Sports Writer Chris Lehourites in London contributed to this report.
Claims by a French newspaper that seven time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong had taken EPO were attacked as unsound and unethical by the director of the Canadian laboratory whose tests saw Olympic drug cheat Ben Johnson hit with a lifetime ban.
L'Equipe on Tuesday carried a front page story headlined "Armstrong's Lie" suggesting the Texan had used the illegal blood booster EPO (erythropoeitin) during his first Tour win in 1999.
The sports daily based its accusation on tests carried out by a French laboratory on frozen urine samples taken during the race six years ago.
Armstrong issued an immediate denial and on Wednesday L'Equipe's story came under fire from Christiane Ayotte, a director at Canada's National Research Institute.
"The stablity of EPO in urine isn't as long as five years according to our testing here in Montreal.
It's more a matter of months," stressed Ayotte, whose testing centre is accredited to WADA, the world's anti doping agency.
Ayotte though was quick not to cast doubts on the testing procedures of the French laboratory cited in the L'Equipe report.
"If the lab in Paris claims to have identified categorically the presence of erythropoetin in this urine then I have no doubt that the identification's adequate."
But she believes the paper's use of this as evidence is unethical.
"It's here that I question the context of the research.
Testing must be carried out on true anonymous samples in a way that you can't link the athlete to the findings."
In such a case she argued you had to have the possibility of carrying out a second B Sample test to verify the result.
"The tracibility has to have been maintained throughout the five years,so that there's no ambiguity which is being made between the result, the sample, and the identity of the athlete."
Ayotte suggested this hadn't been the case with the findings used by L'Equipe to back up their story.
"This has been carried out in a context of research which means that there hasn't been the strictiness that one finds in keeping papers to create a file when there's a positive result."
She said she was "astonished" that the laboratory had allowed the newspaper to put a name to the samples and that it had confirmed the presence of EPO in them.
"That's just not done," she claimed.
"Do you think athletes are going to give their agreement to research if similar things like this happen?
"There's evidently been some wrongdoing here but we have to be sure we're pointing the finger at the guilty person and that it's done in the proper way."
French fans directed harsh words at the newspaper that accused seven time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong of doping, saying the report has no bearing on their respect for the American cyclist.
L'Equipe published a series of letters to the editor in its weekend magazine Saturday in response to last week's cover story that Armstrong used a banned blood booster in his first Tour win in 1999.
The cyclist has denied the charges.
Of the seven letters published, six voiced support for Armstrong and varying degrees of anger at the newspaper for what they called pointless muckraking.
"Leave him alone!" wrote Eugenie Hays from the Brittany town of La Forest Landerneau.
Like many readers, she noted that so many athletes take banned products these days but not everyone inspires like Armstrong.
"Don't shatter our dreams."
Louis Riche, another reader, wrote in to say that, "these accusations (true or false having little importance) only show one thing: that scientific research is seven years late."
He questioned whether French cyclists would face the same scrutiny as the American star.
"So, in six years we'll know if Thomas Voeckler was doped on the 2004 Tour," Riche asked about the rider who held the yellow jersey for 10 stages that year.
"Ah, no, am I crazy?
He's French."
L'Equipe reported Tuesday that new tests on six urine samples he provided during the 1999 tour resulted in positive results for the red blood cell booster EPO.
William Dubois wrote to say he does a fair amount of cycling and understands the need for an energy booster.
"For me, my EPO, from time to time is (licorice flavored aperitif) pastis and, at Sunday dinner, a good glass of wine!
I know that professionals don't only drink mineral water," he said.
Not everyone spared Armstrong from judgment.
"You were my hero," wrote Rahila Abdul.
"Why did you do it?"
Even facing the most serious drug allegations of his career, Lance Armstrong says he sleeps well at night.
The seven time Tour de France champion continues to try to beat back reports in the French media that he used a banned blood booster in his first tour victory in 1999.
On Thursday, he lashed out at the French lab that produced the findings in question.
"There's a setup here and I'm stuck in the middle of it," Armstrong told The Associated Press.
"I absolutely do not trust that laboratory."
The French sports daily L'Equipe reported Tuesday that new exams on six urine samples Armstrong provided during the 1999 tour resulted in positive results for the red blood cell booster EPO.
Armstrong's comment came after Dick Pound, head of the World Anti Doping Agency, said officials had received the lab results and would review them.
Armstrong also said that while Pound might trust the lab that tested the samples, "I certainly don't."
On Thursday night, Armstrong elaborated on that distrust during an appearance on CNN's "Larry King Live."
"A guy in a Parisian laboratory opens up your sample, you know, Jean Francois so and so, and he tests it nobody's there to observe, no protocol was followed and then you get a call from a newspaper that says 'We found you to be positive six times for EPO.'
Well, since when did newspapers start governing sports?"
Although frustrated by the report and the difficulty of proving his case, Armstrong said he sleeps well at night knowing that he's competed drug free.
"All I can do is come on this stage and tell my story and be honest.
I've always done that," he said.
"Since this stuff's rolled out, I sleep great at night ,I don't have a problem looking at myself in the mirror."
Armstrong questions the validity of testing samples frozen six years ago, how those samples were handled since, and how he could be expected to defend himself when the only confirming evidence the 'A' sample used for the 1999 tests no longer exists.
He also charged officials at the suburban Paris lab with violating WADA code for failing to safeguard the anonymity of any remaining 'B' samples it had.
"Nowadays, we all want clean sport," Armstrong told King.
"And fortunately, an organization called WADA has come along and has really governed the world of anti doping.
They have set about a protocol and a code that everybody has to live by.
And (the lab) violated the code several times."
The French report appears stronger than previous doping allegations raised against Armstrong, said Pound, the WADA chairman.
"There's been an awful lot of rumor and accusation about him for a number of years, always of the he said, she said variety.
This appears I haven't seen the documents myself to have some documentary connection.
That's a lot more serious.
It's got to be taken more seriously," Pound said.
"If he had one, you could say it was an aberration.
When you get up to six, there's got to be some explanation."
Pound said the lab is accredited by the International Olympic Committee and that he trusts it handled the samples properly.
Pound also questioned the need for two samples to confirm a positive test.
"You can count on the fingers of one hand the times a B sample has not confirmed the result of the A sample," Pound said.
"It's almost always a delaying tactic."
Armstrong said that contradicts WADA's own drug testing policy.
"For the head of the agency to say he actually doesn't believe in the code ,if your career is riding on the line, wouldn't you want a B sample?"
Armstrong told the AP.
"The French have been after (me) forever, and 'Whoops!' there's no B sample?
The stakes are too high."
Pound said the lab had asked WADA months ago if the agency was interested in reviewing its findings and that he agreed.
He said the agency didn't expect names to be connected to the findings, but only wanted to see if the leftover samples from 1999 would show riders used EPO.
"They said it's simply research," Pound said.
Pound said he's waiting for WADA Science Director Olivier Rabin to return from Europe to review the results.
Armstrong told King he was tested dozens of times during all his Tour de France races, and was under exceptional scrutiny including right before his final race in June.
"Just a day before the start we had a knock on the door, and the minister of sport had sent a crew down there to collect two samples of urine and two samples of blood," Armstrong said.
"And we checked around and found out that nobody else in the peloton was tested that day.
So I can't say 'witch hunt' loud enough."
French sports daily L'Equipe reported Tuesday that Lance Armstrong used the performance enhancing drug EPO to help win his first Tour de France in 1999, a report the seven time Tour winner vehemently denied.
L'Equipe devoted four pages to its allegations, with the front page headline "The Armstrong Lie."
The paper said that signs of EPO use showed up in Armstrong's urine six times during the '99 race.
"Unfortunately, the witch hunt continues and tomorrow's article is nothing short of tabloid journalism," Armstrong wrote on his Web site.
"I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance enhancing drugs."
However, Tour de France director Jean Marie Leblanc said Tuesday that L'Equipe's report seemed "very complete, very professional, very meticulous" and that it "appears credible."
"We are very shocked, very troubled by the revelations we read this morning," Leblanc told RTL radio.
He cautioned that Armstrong, his doctors and his aides should be heard out before people make any final judgment.
Leblanc also said any disciplinary action appeared unlikely, based on the L'Equipe account.
The paper's investigation was based solely on B samples the second of two samples used in doping tests.
The A samples were used in 1999 for analysis at the time.
The governing body of world cycling did not begin using a urine test for EPO until 2001.
For years, it had been impossible to detect the drug, called erythropoietin, which builds endurance by boosting the production of oxygen rich red blood cells.
EPO tests on the 1999 B urine samples were not carried out until last year, when scientists performed research on them to fine tune EPO testing methods, the paper said.
The national anti doping laboratory in Chatenay Malabry, which developed the EPO test and analyzed the urine samples in question, said it could not confirm that the positive EPO results were Armstrong's.
It noted that the samples were anonymous, bearing only a a six digit number to identify the rider, and could not be matched with the name of any one cyclist.
However, L'Equipe said it was able to make the match.
It printed photos of what it said were official doping documents.
On one side of the page, it showed what it said were the results of EPO tests from anonymous riders used for lab research.
On the other, it showed Armstrong's medical certificates, signed by doctors and riders after doping tests and bearing the same identifying number printed on the results.
The lab statement said it had promised to turn over its results to the World Anti Doping Agency "on condition that they could not be used in any disciplinary proceeding."
"It will be very interesting to see what UCI does and what the U.S. Cycling Federation does and what Lance Armstrong has to say," WADA chairman Dick Pound said.
"If the evidence is seen as credible than yes, he has an obligation to come forward and specifically give his comments, especially after his previous comments that he has never used drugs.
"If anything were found, we couldn't do anything because we didn't even exist in 1999.
But it's important that the truth must always be made clear," Pound added.
L'Equipe, whose parent company is closely linked to the Tour, has frequently raised questions about how Armstrong could have made his spectacular comeback from testicular cancer without using performance enhancers.
L'Equipe is owned by the Amaury Group whose subsidiary, Amaury Sport Organization, organizes the Tour de France and other sporting events.
A former L'Equipe journalist, Pierre Ballester, was co author of a book published last year that contained doping allegations against Armstrong.
He wrote the book with The Sunday Times sportswriter David Walsh.
In the book, "L.A. Confidential, the Secrets of Lance Armstrong," one of the cyclist's former assistants claimed that Armstrong once asked her to dispose of used syringes and give him makeup to conceal needle marks on his arms.
Armstrong has taken libel action against The Sunday Times after the British newspaper reprinted allegations in a review of the book in June 2004.
The case will go to trial in London's High Court in November.
Armstrong retired from cycling after his record seventh straight Tour victory last month.
WADA boss Dick Pound has claimed UCI head Hein Verbruggen tipped off L'Equipe in the Armstrong doping case.
Pound told a press conference in Montreal on Thursday that it was Verbruggen who had given information about Armstrong to the French daily, which reported on August 23 that urine samples from Armstrong's first of seven Tour de France wins in 1999 contained traces of banned blood boosting drug EPO.
When asked if Verbruggen had given information to French daily L'Equipe, Pound said: "Yes.
He at least has shown all six (doping test forms signed by Armstrong) to the journalist and he gave the journalist at least one copy."
Since the fall out from the allegations, Verbruggen has never publicly pointed the finger at the American.
Armstrong has continually denied he took performance enhancing substances and pointed out proper procedures had not been followed and no B sample was provided.
IOC president Jacques Rogge called Friday for outside "independent observers" to investigate allegations that seven time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong tested positive for EPO at the 1999 race.
Both the International Cycling Union and the World Anti Doping Agency have announced separate inquiries into the case, but Rogge said he prefers a fully independent probe.
"I have asked that an independent inquiry be started to pinpoint the different responsibilities," Rogge said, adding he hoped "the inquiry, if possible, would also be able to show whether the sample was positive."
In August, the French sports paper L'Equipe published documentation alleging six of Armstrong's frozen urine samples from the 1999 Tour came back positive for endurance boosting EPO when they were retested last year.
Armstrong denied using banned drugs and said he was the victim of a "witch hunt."
Rogge wants a group of "independent observers" who are linked to WADA but operate autonomously to settle the issues if the UCI and WADA investigations lead to different conclusions.
"If they have the same conclusion, no problem.
But if they differ it would be good to go to the independent observers," he said.
Rogge questioned whether the samples belonged to Armstrong and whether they contained EPO.
He insisted Armstrong's rights had not properly been respected.
"Armstrong still enjoys the presumption of innocence," he said in an interview on the sidelines of a meeting with Belgian business leaders.
Rogge also said he wants to extend to all sporting federations the system of keeping doping samples for eight years for possible retroactive sanctions.
He hopes WADA will come up with a viable procedure within the coming months.
"It can be solved quickly," he said.
On Thursday, the UCI said it had appointed Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman and his firm to conduct an independent investigation into L'Equipe's allegations.
The cycling body said WADA's investigation was flawed because it was an "involved party."
The leaders of WADA and UCI have been engaged in a bitter feud over the case.
Last month, WADA chief Dick Pound accused former UCI president Hein Verbruggen of leaking documents about the alleged positive tests to L'Equipe.
He also questioned UCI's willingness to fully investigate the allegations.
UCI denied Pound's accusations and claimed he was blocking its investigation by withholding information.
Cycling did not test for EPO until 2001.
Backup "B" samples from 1999 were frozen and tested for EPO last year.
Any sanctions are unlikely because the original "A" samples were used up and can't be verified for confirmation.
World Anti Doping Agency chief Dick Pound denied claims by the International Cycling Union that WADA withheld information for the probe into whether Lance Armstrong used banned substances during the 1999 Tour de France.
"We tried to the best of our possibilities to provide the information that we have," Pound told a news conference on Tuesday after a meeting of WADA's executive committee.
He said he was puzzled by a request from cycling's world governing body for information on Armstrong because WADA did not exist at the time of the alleged doping incidents.
Pound said WADA was concerned about the "accusatory approach" by UCI, which accused WADA of withholding information.
"We were only formed after these events took place in 1999," Pound said.
"We are unable to answer questions of what may have been on the minds of the UCI or the lab."
On Monday, the UCI denied Pound's assertion that its president Hein Verbruggen supplied information to the French newspaper L'Equipe, which reported last month that Armstrong's urine samples from the 1999 race contained traces of the banned endurance enhancing drug EPO.
The UCI urged WADA to censure Pound or assign someone else to the case.
"I thought about sanctioning myself and decided against it," Pound quipped.
"We're a bit nervous about the way this is going, so while we're willing to be helpful in the context of a full investigation, we're not there to participate in something that amounts to a search of how the information made its way in the public domain."
Armstrong has denied ever using banned drugs, and said he was the victim of a "witch hunt" after the article was published.
Separately, Pound said on Tuesday that FIFA was inching closer to compliance with WADA's anti doping code after the soccer body revised its rules to allow WADA to appeal any FIFA rulings to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
The arrangement amounted to "a good decision" avoiding future public confrontation, he said.
Pound said this year FIFA risked expulsion from the Olympics because it failed to accept two year bans for serious doping offenses.
WADA also announced that it approved the 2006 list of prohibited substances and methods, which would be published before October and go into effect on Jan 1, 2006.
WADA said in a news release that the new list was a "consolidation list and includes only minor modifications."
American cycling hero Lance Armstrong said Thursday he is content to stay retired and has no plans to go for an eighth straight Tour de France title.
Armstrong claims he spoke too soon when he said earlier this month that he was prepared to make a comeback just to spite French organizers of the world's most challenging bike race.
"I am happy with the way my career went and I am happy with the way it ended.
I am not coming back," Armstrong said.
"There is no way I can go back there (France).
I would be crazy, so why don't we all just say I am not going back."
Armstrong, who retired after his seventh consecutive Tour de France victory in July, has been accused of using banned blood booster EPO (erythropoietin) by French sports daily L'Equipe in an article which showed details of 1999 drugs tests.
Once again Armstrong vehemently denied the allegations on Thursday.
"I am going to say this in just a few words.
I have nothing to hide," Armstrong said.
The 33 year old Armstrong believes there are too many people who are against him in France to make it possible for him to go back and ride.
"I opened it up a few weeks ago by saying I might come back," Armstrong said.
"But today I am dealing with all this again.
"I know if I go back there is no way I am going to get a fair shake in the lab, on the roadside, in the hotel, in my food.
"I am sick of dealing with this (expletive).
I got three kids in the pool right now and they are screaming my name."
On August 23, L'Equipe reported with a front page headline "The Armstrong Lie" that six of Armstrong's urine samples tested positive for EPO during the 1999 race.
L'Equipe reported that positive results came solely from B samples, the second of two samples used in doping tests.
Armstrong said Thursday the integrity of the international anti doping system is at stake because of the way the samples were mis handled and the manner in which the information passed on to the newspaper.
He also isn't ruling out sabotage.
"We believe in standing up for what is right," Armstrong said.
These were not the first allegations of drug use against Armstrong since his recovery from testicular cancer in 1996.
A 2004 book by former L'Equipe journalist Pierre Ballester entitled "LA Confidential: The Secrets of Lance Armstrong," cited one of the cyclist's former assistants claiming Armstrong once asked her to dispose of used syringes.
Until 2001, cycling's international governing body did not use a urine test for EPO, which builds endurance by boosting the oxygen carrying capacity of blood.
The governing agency for professional cycling appointed an independent investigator Thursday to look into accusations that the American cycling champion Lance Armstrong had used banned drugs.
Armstrong, 34, the seven time winner of the Tour de France bicycle race, retired from competitive cycling in July after his seventh consecutive victory.
The governing body, the International Cycling Union, said that Emile Vrijman and his law firm, Lamsma Veldstra & Lobe, based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, would investigate claims by the French newspaper L'Equipe that six samples of Armstrong's frozen urine from the 1999 Tour de France had tested positive for the hormone erythropoietin, or EPO, which aids a cyclist's endurance.
The urine samples had been saved, frozen and recently tested for a research project.
Even though the samples were anonymous, the article said paperwork linked the coded samples to Armstrong.
The cycling union did not test for EPO until 2001.
Armstrong, who could not be reached for comment on Thursday, has denied the charges, saying he is the victim of a "witch hunt."
But Dan Osipow, a spokesman for Armstrong's racing team's sponsor, Discovery Channel, said: "We're pleased that the UCI is forming this investigation unit to try to get to the bottom of this case.
If appointing this group helps, we're for it."
After the article in L'Equipe appeared, Armstrong said he was considering racing again, but later changed his mind.
"There is no way I could go to France and get a fair shake on the roads, in doping control or in the labs," Armstrong told reporters last month from his home in Austin, Texas.
"There's no way I could go back there.
I would be crazy."
The cycling union appointed Vrijman on Sept 30, but did not disclose the information on its Web site until Thursday.
Vrijman is the former director of the National Anti Doping Agency in the Netherlands.
"The UCI has entrusted Mr Vrijman and his law firm the task to undertake a comprehensive investigation regarding all issues concerning the testing conducted by the French laboratory of urine samples from the 1999 Tour de France," the cycling union said in a statement on its Web site.
"The UCI expects all relevant parties to fully co operate with the investigation."
Armstrong, a cancer survivor, was on a 3300 mile bicycle ride across the United States on Thursday helping to raise money for cancer research.
The International Cycling Union denies accusations that its president supplied a French sports newspaper with documents which it used to accuse Lance Armstrong of doping at the 1999 Tour de France.
Also on Monday, the UCI said World Anti Doping Agency chief Dick Pound was blocking its investigation by withholding information.
Pound said last week he received a letter from UCI president Hein Verbruggen saying he had provided L'Equipe with forms indicating Armstrong had tested positive for EPO during his first Tour victory.
"Mr Pound's transparently erroneous statements about the UCI being the source of the forms are difficult to explain, except that they appear to be an attempt by Mr Pound to draw attention away from his efforts to obstruct and delay the UCI investigation," UCI said in a statement.
"Mr Verbruggen has never been involved personally, contrary to what Mr Pound said in another statement.
However, it is also apparent that the reporters were given at least five and perhaps 15 of Lance Armstrong's doping control forms from the 1999 Tour de France, and it is certain that those forms did not come from the UCI."
The UCI said it was conducting an investigation at WADA's request.
"It has been three weeks ,and WADA has failed, to date, to provide all the documents and information we have requested, which we need to conduct the investigation, even though WADA has stated its willingness to assist the UCI," the statement added.
"The investigation of the testing and the results that were published must logically start with the laboratory and WADA and we are waiting for a response from them to our questions."
UCI also called on WADA to either censure its chief or assign someone else to deal with this case.
"It is essential for the WADA Board to hold Mr Pound accountable and ,act swiftly and definitively to establish that conduct of this type will not be tolerated."
Last month, L'Equipe published evidence allegedly showing that six of Armstrong's frozen urine samples from 1999 came back positive for endurance boosting EPO when they were retested last year.
The seven time Tour de France champion denied ever using banned drugs, and said he was the victim of a "witch hunt."
UCI said it had not received enough information to make a judgment on the allegations.
It also criticized L'Equipe for targeting Armstrong, and criticized Pound for making public statements on the "likely guilt of the athlete" without knowing all the facts.
Pound questioned the UCI's willingness to fully investigate L'Equipe's allegations and wondered whether the cycling body was merely looking for a "scapegoat."
"We're waiting to see whether they have a commitment to get at the truth and the whole truth before we decide to participate further in the investigation," Pound said at the time.
"If one of the issues that the UCI wants to explore is how some of this information became public, that's fine.
But we're not prepared to sit by and participate in an investigation that focuses only on how the information became public."
At first, it sounded like a delicious prank Lance Armstrong riding again in France, just to annoy his critics.
The champion who would not go away.
In reality, it is a terrible idea.
The last thing Armstrong, the seven time winner of the Tour de France, needs next year is to be racing downhill in the Alps or the Pyrenees.
Now that Armstrong has taken on institutional France as the source of the latest drug charges against him, who knows what plastic shopping bag or stray foot might be lurking amidst the swarms on the mountainsides?
"There are other countries in Europe," Armstrong said Tuesday, referring to the challenging national races of Italy or Spain.
He is nothing if not combative.
During the 2004 Tour, Armstrong chased down Filippo Simeoni, an Italian cyclist who had testified against Armstrong's adviser, Dr Michele Ferrari, who has since been implicated in unethical practices.
It was hardly normal for a Tour leader to intervene in a harmless breakaway, but Armstrong had to aggress Simeoni.
Just as he was on his bicycle, Armstrong, in the first months of retirement, is a ferocious legal competitor.
Armstrong, who has vehemently denied ever using performance enhancing drugs, is now vowing to pursue two cases even though they could very well open unpleasant testimony.
"That's the way I was raised," he said.
At the moment, Armstrong is combating the Aug 23 article in L'Equipe, the French sports daily, that said six of his 1999 samples tested for EPO, the blood boosting drug, appeared positive in a recent test.
Armstrong is not about to lose any of his seven championships, nor should he.
The retroactive tests were done only on the B urine samples that had been retained from 1999.
A subsequent article in The New York Times revealed a collegial controversy among scientists about the current test for EPO.
The release of this data, whether accurate or not, violates all standards of confidentiality and control that should govern drug testing.
The International Cycling Union, known as UCI, which has belatedly ratcheted up its testing process in recent years, appeared to shrug off the charges last week, lacking further proof.
"The question is not about me but about the process and the ethics," Armstrong said Tuesday in a telephone interview.
There are, however, enough claims and rumors and old enemies and circumstantial evidence going around to do continued harm to Armstrong's image in his home country the cancer survivor who won the Tour seven times and has built a foundation to fight the disease that almost killed him.
He is battling for his reputation as he often attacked a competitor on the slopes of France.
"You do 'Larry King Live,"' Armstrong said Tuesday, citing one Internet poll that showed 87 percent of the people believed him "stateside."
Still, doubts have been raised.
A trial, scheduled for High Court in London on Nov 6 involves his suit concerning excerpts from the book "L.A. Confidentiel: Les Secrets de Lance Armstrong," published in The Sunday Times of London in 2004.
"I'm looking forward to it," Armstrong said.
"You sit there and tell your side of it."
It is likely that some people critical of Armstrong in the book will be testifying.
"There will be cross examination," Armstrong said.
"My lawyers tell me they do this all the time."
Armstrong might be liable for court costs, which could amount to more than $1 million, if he dropped the Sunday Times suit.
"But Lance feels he was defamed by The Sunday Times," Bill Stapleton, Armstrong's agent, said Tuesday.
The book contains voluminous allusions to drug use in cycling that resulted in the deaths of dozens of young riders, plus various scandals and suspensions.
So far it has been published only in French.
The other impending legal case involves Armstrong's suit to claim the $5 million bonus for winning his sixth consecutive Tour in 2004, as guaranteed by an insurance company, SCA Promotions, in Texas.
SCA has cited the book and other doubts as a reason for not paying.
"That's a question of Texas contract law," Armstrong said.
"What's the deal?
Pay the money."
Armstrong concedes that the L'Equipe charges may be raised in some of his legal cases.
The paper is owned by the same corporation that runs the Tour de France, which made millions of dollars from American tourism and corporate involvement during the Armstrong years.
When Armstrong retired, the 1999 B samples somehow materialized at L'Equipe.
Stapleton and Armstrong have been highly critical of Richard W. Pound, the head of the World Anti Doping Agency, for calling for further investigation of the 1999 tests.
They say the B samples should never have been released and are unreliable, six years later, given the upgraded testing in recent years.
"EPO is a powerful drug," Armstrong said Tuesday.
"Some say it makes you 10 percent faster.
Let's say I took EPO in 1999 and didn't take it from 2000 to 2005.
My performance never dropped off.
Obviously, I'm not saying I did.
But I only got faster."
Armstrong said there are "many factors" for his being investigated in France, including the loss of dominance by French riders in the past two decades.
He has generally been well received by French cycling fans by the side of the road, however, and claiming French anti Americanism is not fair.
Many Europeans assume that cyclists rely on chemicals in one form or another.
American sports fans are only now developing their cynical side after recent developments in baseball.
It appears that Armstrong has a large tiger by the tail, in what he had depicted as a placid retirement.
Since his last ride up the Champs Elysees, on July 24, Armstrong has proposed to his girlfriend, Sheryl Crow, spent time with his three children, and, through the Lance Armstrong Foundation, donated $500000 to cancer victims uprooted by Hurricane Katrina.
In recent days, he has appeared at a testimonial to his blocking back, George Hincapie, in South Carolina on Saturday, rooted for his peer, Andre Agassi, at the U.S. Open in New York on Sunday, then jetted out to Sun Valley, Idaho, to cycle with his pal Robin Williams.
Mostly, Lance Armstrong's retirement sounds much like his racing career.
People pursue him.
He pursues people.
Seven time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong is considering coming out of retirement in a bid to take revenge on the hosts of the world's biggest race following a spate of doping accusations, an Austin, Texas newspaper reported Tuesday.
"I'm thinking about it," the Austin American Statesman quoted Armstrong as saying.
"I'm thinking it's the best way to piss (the French) off."
Armstrong told the newspaper he had been thinking about a comeback for only the past two weeks, since French sports daily L'Equipe reported on August 23 that urine samples taken from Armstrong in 1999 during his first Tour triumph tested positive for the banned substance EPO.
Asked how serious he was about another Tour, Armstrong replied: "I'm exercising every day."
Armstrong retired in July after winning his seventh straight Tour de France but expectations of relaxing holidays with his three kids and his new fiancee, rock star Sheryl Crow, have been tempered by a spate of doping allegations.
The Texan has vehemently denied taking any performance enhancing drugs however a number of experts and former employees have come out of the woodwork to denounce the Texan champion.
Johan Bruyneel, the 33 year old Armstrong's team manager at Discovery Channel, admitted that nothing concrete had been decided but the door was still open for a return.
"We could decide during our training camp in December (in the United States), which will be decisive (for the Tour)," Bruyneel told the Belgian news agency Belga.
"But don't make me say that Lance has already decided what he will do with the rest of his career.
That said, we speak for 15 minutes on the phone every day, and for 13 of those we talk about cycling."
Bruyneel, who has orchestrated Armstrong's career since the American returned to cycling after his successful recovery from cancer in 1998, suggested Armstrong simply missed racing.
"He (Armstrong) got back on the bike to train three weeks after the end of the Tour de France.
He follows the team's progress closely and it's sure that he's still hungry for success.
"He's missing racing, and everything that goes with it.
That's normal.
Maybe he's thinking about taking some kind of sporting revenge for the allegations of doping that he's had to hear day after day.
"He could be feeling the need to prove to everyone that he is the strongest, and that it's not down to illegal substances.
"There will always be a place on the team for him, if he decides to come back.
Anyway, he's still under contract with us till the end of 2006."
The IOC Athletes Commission and the Summer Olympic sports (ASOIF) have demanded the French lab that claimed Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong had tested positive for doping in 1999 be suspended.
The demand, in a letter to Dick Pound, the president of the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) and obtained by AFP, insists the laboratory broke a host of rules set down in the World Anti Doping Code.
"The consequences of a positive test for an athlete are so severe that the procedures that lead to such a result must adhere to extremely strict rules and the results must be based on irrefutable evidence.
"In this case, it appears that numerous violations of the World Anti Doping Code have been committed and that the most basic guarantees, for which every athlete has a right, have been held up to ridicule," said the letter, signed by ASOIF president Denis Oswald and Sergei Bubka, head of the IOC's athletes commission.
ASOIF and the athletes commission claim that the tests carried out by the Chtenay Malabry laboratory on Armstrong's sample were illegal.
They also complain that the system used by the lab brings into doubt the whole procedure.
"WADAs International Standard for Laboratories goes on to say that laboratories must use a unique internal code for each sample, that no information that could link an athlete with an individual result may be included in its reports to WADA and, in general, that athlete confidentiality is a key concern for all laboratories engaged in doping control cases.
"Confidentiality requires extra safeguards given the sensitive nature of these tests.
"However, in this case, the results of the analysis that have been done for research purposes, not even anti doping control purposes, have been reported not with the internal laboratory code (which was not even necessary for reporting research results), but with the sample code!
"The results have been reported in a way so as to be able to identify the race, the day other samples were taken and, based on the doping control form containing the sample code, the identity of the athletes tested!
"This is simply unacceptable.
"This says a lot about the complicity and the professional ethics of those involved.
"Obviously, the lab itself does not have the right to publicly confirm or comment upon analyses considering these were done illegally and their identification was made in violation of the guarantee of confidentiality.
"These events not only cast serious doubt on the credibility of the French anti doping system, but also on the entire world wide anti doping fight if such blatant transgressions are not rectified and those responsible properly disciplined," they complained.
Oswald and Bubka warned that athletes may be wary of competing in France in the future "if their due rights are so carelessly disregarded and there is the possibility that they too could find themselves facing accusations at the end of procedures to which they were not a party."
Pound said that although WADA did not have all the facts of the case there did not appear to be any ethical rules broken by the French laboratory.
Seven time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong was given major support in his fight against doping allegations on Friday by the International Cycling Union (UCI) and a Texas legal triumph.
Capping a week that included his engagement to rock singer Sheryl Crow and hints at a possible 2006 return from retirement, Armstrong had his denials of taking performance enhancing drugs strongly bolstered in separate findings.
A UCI statement said no action would be taken against Armstrong over claims by the French sports daily L'Equipe that his 1999 urine samples tested positive for the banned blood booster EPO (erythropoietin).
Cycling's world governing body found nothing that could be used as proof of wrongdoing by Armstrong and no reason to condemn him, wondering instead who leaked Armstrong's identity and why his sample was chosen for testing.
"Im pleased the UCI is investigating this entire matter thoroughly because any professional investigation will reveal that the allegations made by a French sports tabloid have no basis because I never used any performance enhancing drugs," Armstrong said in a statement.
"Im pleased that the UCI seems to be asking many of the right questions."
Armstrong, who turns 34 on September 18, also won a summary judgement in a Texas court case that dismissed charges Armstrong defrauded and breached a contract with his former personal assistant, Mike Anderson.
The legal fight included Anderson claims that he found items in a Spanish apartment linking Armstrong to banned substances and that Armstrong avoided a 2004 random doping test.
"This totally vindicates Lance's position.
He's pleased," said Bill Stapleton, a lawyer for Armstrong.
"Today vindicates Lance and points out that the accusations he made against Lance were without merit in an American court.
"The Anderson ruling is very significant in that he has been someone who has been given credibility in newspapers in France like Le Monde and L'Equipe."
Armstrong's engagement to Crow was announced Monday, a day before the US cycling legend stated that he might seek an eighth consecutive Tour victory next July as a result of the latest accusations.
"The recent smear campaign out of France has awoken my competitive side," Armstrong said.
"I'm not willing to put a percentage on the chances but I will no longer rule it out."
The African Union (AU) was Tuesday in a desperate move to put back on track peace negotiations on the crisis in the western Sudanesen to the roundtable, AU spokesman Assane Ba said.
"We are looking with the partners on what next step to take", said Ba.
The AU team, which also met with the Sudanese goverment delegation, hopes to meet the SLM at 4.30 pm (15:30 GMT) and JEM later in the day, he also said.
The continental organisation expressed the hope that the current efforts would help convince the rebels to return to the roundtable and put back on track the threatened talks.
In N'Djamena Tuesday talks between Sudan's government and a rebel group from the strife wracked Darfur region began, with Chad mediating.
Chad's Foreign Minister Nagoum Yamasoum said the aim of negotiations between Khartoum's delegates and those of the National Movement for Reconstruction and Development (NMRD) was to help with peace talks already in hand for Darfur in Nigeria.
The NMRD has recently appeared on the scene in Darfur, as a dissident wing of the rebel JEM.
AU mediators refused to grant recognition tos rose up against the government in February 2003.
Rebels in Darfur rose up against Khartoum 22 months ago, accusing the Arab led government of marginalising Darfur's mainly black African population and demanding political autonomy and a greater share of Sudan's oil wealth.
The third round of peace talks aimed at ending a 22 month old crisis in Sudan's troubled Darfur region reopened in Nigerian capital Abuja on Saturday with both sides hoping for a lasting political settlement.
"I'm very optimistic about this meeting.
I'm sure we're going to achieve a lot this time because all the parties are ready for peace," spokesman for the government delegation, Ibrahim Mohammed Ibrahim, told reporters, after a brief opening ceremony.
Both the Khartoum government and the rebel groups have been trading accusations over the violations of the deals on security and humanitarian aid, reached in the last round of the African Union sponsored talks that ended on Nov 10.
The continued fighting made UN Special Representative for Sudan Jan Pronk question what could be achieved in Abuja.
"This round of negotiations ,is headed for failure if the parties do not show restraint," Pronk said in a statement released Thursday.
And African Union Commission Chairman Alpha Oumar Konare called Friday the violations "serious and unacceptable" and urged both sides to put an immediate end to all hostilities.
Despite this, one of the main two rebels in Darfur, the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), echoed Saturday in Abuja Ibrahim's optimism at reaching a peace deal.
"I'm actually optimistic we can arrive at something.
For sure, we're going to focus on political issues so that we can tackle the root of the problem in Darfur," said Ahmed Tugod, spokesman for the JEM.
The third round of talks, also likely to be last one, was initially scheduled for Friday but delayed by one day due to "some logistic problems" that led to the failure of the arrival of mediators and some rebels in Darfur.
Delegates said they would regather Sunday afternoon after the opening ceremony ended.
The talks in Abuja are aimed at finding a peace deal to the conflict in Darfur, which the United Nations described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
Locked in the conflict are the two rebel groups, the JEM and the Sudanese Liberation Movement, who are at war with government forces said to be represented by Janjaweed militia since February 2003.
The Sudanese government has however repeatedly distanced itself from the militia.
Thousands were reportedly killed and one million others displaced in Darfur as a result of the conflict.
Around 900 AU troops and monitors are now on the ground, although more than 3000 have been pledged.
The US based group Human Rights Watch Thursday called for their immediate deployment with an enlarged mandate to protect civilians.
A Sudanese rebel leader said in Pretoria on Friday that an agreement between the Sudanese government and rebels would be concluded by Dec 31 as required by the United Nations Security Council Resolution adopted in Kenyan capital Nairobi last month.
Sudanese People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) chairman Paul Garang told a press conference that efforts to bring peace to the Darfur region would get impetus from the pending conciliation accord.
"We are very optimistic, in fact not only optimistic we have committed ourselves to signing the peace agreement," he told reporters after briefing South African Deputy President Jacob Zuma in Pretoria about progress with negotiations.
Zuma said South Africa was "very positive" about progress made with the peace talks.
Garang said on Friday he would travel to Naivasha of Kenya in two days for talks with Sudanese First Vice President Ali Osman Mohamed to ensure the peace process was concluded and signed by the deadline.
Current peace talks in Naivasha were not only about a resolution to the conflict, he stressed.
They were expected to yield a new coalition government and a peaceful democratic transformation of the whole country.
"There will be a new political dynamic in Khartoum that will be better placed to address the issues in Darfur," Garang said.
The Sudanese civil war started in 1983 when the SPLM/A took up arms fighting for self determination in the southern part of the country, which has left some two million people dead, mostly through war induced famine and disease.
As Africa's largest country, Sudan's western Darfur region has also plunged into conflict since February 2003, when two rebel forces took up arms against the Khartoum government, accusing the authorities of not protecting them from the attacks of "Janjaweed" militia and demanding autonomy.
The Darfur crisis has been termed by the United Nations as the world's worst humanitarian crisis, in which thousands were killed and one million displaced.
A third rebel group fighting in the western Darfur region on Friday signed a peace pact with the Khartoum government at talks in Chad.
The third round of peace talks aimed at ending a 22 month old crisis in Sudan's troubled Darfur region has been suspended after the rebels accused government forces of continuing attacking them.
"The talks have been suspended because the government continued to air strike our forces until last week," said Ahmed Tugod, spokesman for one of the main two rebels in Darfur, the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) on Monday.
He confirmed that the other rebel, Sudan Liberation Movement ( SLM), also made the same decision.
"If government forces stop the offensive, we will continue the talks," Tugod added.
Both the rebels and the Khartoum government have been trading accusations over the violations of ceasefire agreement signed earlier.
Officials from the African Union said the violations were poisoning the current round of talks starting on last Saturday in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
Assane Ba, an African Union spokesman, told reporters earlier in the day that the violations went from 13 cases in September to 52 by early December.
"This is poisoning the atmosphere," he said.
The continued fighting also made Jan Pronk, UN Special Representative for Sudan, question what could be achieved in Abuja.
"This round of negotiations ,is headed for failure if the parties do not show restraint," Pronk said in a statement released last week.
But AU officials still hoped the talks could go on as planned on Tuesday.
The talks in Abuja are aimed at finding a peace deal to the conflict in Darfur, which the United Nations described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
Locked in the conflict are the two rebel groups, the JEM and the SLM, who are at war with government forces said to be represented by the Arab militia called Janjaweed since February 2003.
The Sudanese government has however repeatedly distanced itself from the militia.
Thousands were reportedly killed and one million others displaced in Darfur as a result of the conflict.
Around 900 AU troops and monitors are now on the ground, although more than 3000 have been pledged.
Peace talks aimed at ending a 22 month old crisis in Sudan's troubled Darfur region, scheduled for Friday in Nigerian capital Abuja, has been postponed for a day, a spokesman for the African Union said.
Assane Ba said the postponement followed "some logistic problems" that led to the failure of the arrival of mediators and some rebels in Darfur.
The opening ceremony is now scheduled to start at 4:00 p.m. ( 1500 GMT) on Saturday in Abuja, he added.
The Sudanese government and Darfur rebel groups, the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation Movement, signed two protocols on security and humanitarian aid in Abuja one month ago.
But this did not prevent the violence from deteriorating as the United Nations and the African Union expressed serious concern.
Three days ago, UN Under Secretary General for Political Affairs Kieran Prendergast told the Security Council that Darfur was still in chaos, plagued by banditry, rape and village burnings.
"Despite some earlier gains, November was characterized by violence and a marked deterioration in the security situation," Prendergast said.
On Friday, Alpha Oumar Konare, chairman of the African Union Commission warned of continued military operations by both the rebels and the Sudanese government.
Calling the violations "serious and unacceptable," Konare urged them to put an immediate end to all hostilities and demanded that they abide by the agreement and protocols.
He also hoped all the sides in Abuja can reach a political solution to end the conflict and to make it their responsibility to fully honor their commitments.
The United Nations calls the conflict in Darfur the world's worst humanitarian crisis, in which thousands were reportedly killed and one million others displaced.
The crisis is indeed the African Union's first real test for its commitment to security and peace, an issue that bugs the impoverished continent for decades.
Peace talks between the Sudanese government and Darfur's main rebel movements have been suspended until January, according to a joint statement from the parties released by the African Union on Tuesday.
A deal to end the devastating conflict in Sudan's western region of Darfur could be signed by the end of the year, when Khartoum and southern rebels are due to formally end a separate 21 year conflict, the chairman of the African Union said Saturday.
AU chief and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo told a news conference in Dar es Salaam that the AU's intention was "to move on and conclude on Darfur at the same time they conclude in the South.
It is not impossible."
On Friday, Khartoum and the southern rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army promised the UN Security Council in Nairobi that they would conclude two years of peace talks with a comprehensive peace accord to end a war that began in 1983 and has claimed some 1.5 million lives.
Separate negotiations between Khartoum and two rebel groups from Darfur, who rose up against the government in February 2003, are to resume on December 10.
The UN has described the situation in Darfur as the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.
Tens of thousands of people have died and more than 1.6 million been displaced by the fighting.
The African Union has reported 46 cases of ceasefire violations in the troubled Darfur region of Sudan since the last peace talks ended in Abuja, Nov 24, 2004.
Chairman of the AU Ceasefire Commission Festus Okonkwo disclosed this here on Friday in a report to a meeting of the AU joint commission on the Darfur crisis, blaming both the rebels and the Sudanese government for the violations.
The report showed that 28 violations were by the rebels, eight by the government troops while ten were unidentified.
The report, which painted a bad humanitarian picture of the situation in Darfur, urged both the rebels the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudanese Liberation Movement/Army and the Sudanese government to stop the violations as they were impeding the peace process.
Okonwko said that most violations took place on the road, the banks and the camps.
Most UN agencies have since ordered their workers out of troubled Darfur as the violators had killed many workers and injured thousands.
The AU sponsored peace talks in Abuja are currently on halt as the rebels who walked out on Tuesday had vowed never to resume the negotiation process unless the government ends its attacks and withdraws its troops from the troubled area.
The joint commission is between the AU and other partners like the European Union, the United Nations and other interest groups.
At least thousands of people have been killed and one million others displaced since the Darfur crisis started two years ago.
Rebel leaders pulled out of peace talks on the crisis in the western Sudanese region of Darfur on Monday accusing the government of repeatedly breaching a ceasefire deal, spokesmen for their movements said.
The Abuja conference's African Union mediators, however, expressed the hope that the groups could be persuaded to change their minds and said they would attempt to reconvene the talks on Tuesday at 10:00 am (0900 GMT).
"We are suspending the talks until the situation improves," said Ibrahim Bahar of the rebel Sudan Liberation Movement, accusing the Khartoum government of ignoring a truce deal signed during a previous round of negotiations.
"The position of the two movements is the same.
The situation on the ground in Darfur is deteriorating," Mohammed Ahmed Tugod, chief negotiator of the Justice and Equality Movement, told reporters as the conference broke up.
"We have no alternative but to come to this conclusion,in order to stop all the military activities going on in Darfur," he added.
The African Union's lead mediator, Sam Ibok, said that all the international representatives at the talks had advised against the walk out because "there was no justification for such a suspension."
"The talks have not been suspended, we are reconvening at 10:00 am tomorrow," he insisted.
Meanwhile, Sudanese government spokesman Ibrahim Mohammed said: "Only negotiation and talks will solve the problem of Darfur.
Withdrawal from the talks means more trouble for Darfur."
Sudanese government envoys and the leaders of a rebellion in the western province of Darfur opened formal peace negotiations Monday at an African Union sponsored conference in Abuja.
AU special envoy Hamid Algabid welcomed the delegates to the conference venue in the Nigerian capital before the start of closed door talks on the security and humanitarian crisis in the war ravaged region.
The parties have been in informal discussions since Friday but are now expected to begin negotiations on two draft agreements, one guaranteeing the protection of civilians and one on de militarising the conflict.
AU officials expect the talks to last at least three weeks.
The Khartoum governmnet and Darfur's two rebel groups have been at war for 20 months.
A ceasefire deal was signed in Chad's capital Ndjamema in April, but UN and AU monitors say that it is often violated.
The United Nations estimates that 1.5 million people have been driven from their homes during the fighting, and 70000 have been killed.
A senior Egyptian diplomat said Sunday that a five way summit to be held here later in the day eyes finding humanitarian and political solutions to the Darfur crisis within the framework of the African Union (AU).
"The summit will try to find an appropriate way within the AU framework that can be accepted by Sudan's two conflicting sides of their accord, not against their will," the diplomat in the Egyptian delegation told Xinhua in an interview.
"How to strengthen the AU framework is one of the major topics of the summit," he said on condition of anonymity.
Foreign ministers from Libya, Sudan, Egypt, Nigeria and Chad are to convene on the Darfur issue in preparations for the summit slated for late Sunday, which grouped leaders from the five countries.
He noted that the summit is called at an important timing when conflicting views emerged at both regional and international levels toward how to solve the Darfur crisis.
"Egypt has a clear attitude toward the humanitarian aspect in the Darfur issue, that is to say, we have to allow Sudan all opportunities to solve the crisis," the diplomat said.
As a neighboring country of Sudan, Egypt would try its best to offer help, the diplomat said, adding Egypt would like to call for a similar summit in the near future if necessary.
Queried about the role of Arab countries in this regard, the diplomat said Egypt welcomes any effort made by Arab countries if it would benefit Sudan.
Clashes flared up in February 2003 between marauding militia, known as Janjaweed, and local black Africans over scarce resources in the barren western Sudanese region of Darfur.
Two rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), took up arms to fight the Janjaweed, which was believed to be responsible for killings and lootings.
They also accused the government of years of negligence and unfair allocation of resources.
Peace talks between the Sudanese government and the rebel groups have adjourned in the Nigerian capital of Abuja without major breakthrough and would be resumed after the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.
The Egyptian diplomat said the summit in Libya would focus on finding ways to revive the stalled peace talks.
"During the summit, all concerned Sudanese parties are expected to pledge sincere and practical efforts to settle the disputes," he added.
The summit was called under the AU auspices in a bid to solve the Darfur crisis, which has grabbed unprecedented world attention.
The UN Security Council adopted a resolution on Sept 18, urging the Sudanese government to stabilize the situation in Darfur and fully cooperate with the AU.
The AU has spearheaded international attempts to resolve the crisis and is in the process of deploying a 4500 strong force from around five African countries to Sudan to oversee the peace process.
Libya and the African Union Tuesday invited Sudanese President Omar al Beshir to a mini summit in Libya on the Darfur crisis, due to be attended by Sudan's neighbors Chad and Egypt.
This came during a meeting between Beshir and Libyan leader Moamer Khadafi's special envoy, Said Arabi Hefiana, and Nigeria's junior foreign minister, Aboubakar Tanko, who is also assistant secretary general of the AU.
Hefiana and Tanko delivered the invitation in letters from Khadafi and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, the current chairman of the AU, which is sponsoring peace talks between Khartoum and Darfur rebels.
The official Al Anbaa daily on Tuesday quoted Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail as saying the letters also dealt with the situation in Darfur and efforts by the AU to resolve the 20 month conflict there.
Hefiana and Tanko flew to Khartoum from Egypt where they delivered a message to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, also inviting him to the summit.
Following the meeting, Egyptian presidential spokesman Maged Abdel Fattah told reporters consultations were underway to determine the exact date of the summit, which was to take place "before October 21".
The summit was part of ongoing AU efforts to "contain the situation in Darfur", where conflict has left some 50000 people dead, displaced an estimated 1.4 million and forced nearly 200000 to flee into neighboring Chad.
It also aimed to "fend off the consequences of United Nations Security Council resolutions and consolidate the role of the AU in dealing with the conflict," Abdel Fattah said.
The UN Security Council passed a resolution in September threatening sanctions against Sudan's vital oil industry for the government's failure to rein in pro government Arab militias accused of atrocities in Darfur.
The visits of the Libyan and AU envoys coincided with a meeting in Ndjamena, Chad, of the AU's ceasefire committee and representatives from the Sudanese government and the two main rebel groups in Darfur.
Ismail told A Anbaa participants would also discuss the situation in Darfur and ceasefire violations by Sudan and the Darfur rebels.
He reiterated his government's acceptance of the Security Council resolution on Darfur calling for an increased number of AU troops in Darfur and broadening their mandate, saying this would help in the process of confidence building, particularly between the police and displaced persons.
Sudan recently agreed that the AU could deploy its troops in camps for displaced persons in Darfur to monitor the activities of the police.
Ismail said the move would reassure the displaced, many of who accuse the police of complicity in attacks against them by Arab militias and encourage them to move freely in and out of the camps.
The news comes as British Prime Minister Tony Blair prepared to pay a brief visit to Sudan Wednesday for talks with Sudanese leaders on several issues, including the Darfur crisis.
The European Union is ready to finance an African peacekeeping force in the troubled Sudanese region of Darfur to the tune of 100 million euros (126 million dollars), an official said Friday.
"We're ready to finance this operation,and 100 million euros could be released," an EU diplomat said, underlining that "the EU's substantial contribution is in the process of being approved".
EU foreign affairs chief Javier Solana was due in the region Friday to discuss the crisis in Darfur, the scene of a bloody offensive against rebels by militias backed by the Sudanese government.
The United Nations Security Council has threatened sanctions on Sudan's vital oil industry if Khartoum fails to rein in the militias.
Solana was heading Friday to the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa for talks with officials at the African Union, which is trying to revive stalled peace talks in Nigeria between the Darfur rebels and the Sudanese government.
The AU said Thursday it was going to boost the size of its ceasefire monitoring and civilian protection force in Darfur from 465 to 3320 personnel.
Solana was then to travel to Khartoum for weekend talks on Darfur with Sudanese President Omar el Beshir.
The EU official said before leaving Brussels that the bigger monitoring mission, coupled with the peace talks, represented "a window of opportunity" for Sudan, the AU and the international community.
"This opportunity must not be missed.
The EU will continue contributing to the monitoring mission with financial, technical, expertise and personnel," Solana said in a statement.
The UN estimates that around 70000 people have been killed and 1.5 million displaced in 20 months of war in Darfur.
The EU has already released 12 million euros to support the AU's ceasefire monitoring mission and has sent a team of military experts to support its work out of Addis Ababa.
In Ethiopia, Solana was also to meet John Garang, the leader of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, which is in the final stages of negotiations to end a 21 year war with the Khartoum government.
The Sudanese government and the Darfur rebels will resume peace talks on Thursday in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, head of the government delegation for the talks Majzoub El Khalifa Ahmed said on Wednesday.
Ahmed said security issue "is the only obstacle" on the way to the new round of talks.
"Solving the security issue will help solve all remaining issues between the two sides," Ahmed said in a special statement to the Sudan Media Center (SMC).
"No dispute over economical and social issues in Darfur after the address made by Sudanese President Omar El Basher recently to the Sudanese National Assembly," said he.
When addressing the National Assembly on Oct 4, the Sudanese president announced his government has taken clear policies in Darfur to mend social structure and enhance native administration by offering it more legal and administrative authorities.
The president added that his government pushed forward programs for water, health and education and had specified additional budgets for that.
Ahmed stressed readiness of the Sudanese government for the coming round of talks in order to tackle the pending issues between the two sides.
He referred to the positive atmosphere for the Abuja talks after the five way African summit held last Sunday in the Libyan capital of Tripoli.
He urged the rebel movements in Darfur to respond with responsibility to the talks in Abuja and find a final resolution to the Darfur crisis.
The five way African summit, which was attended by leaders of Nigeria, Libya, Sudan, Egypt and Chad, stressed refusal of any foreign intervention in the Darfur issue.
Nigeria's president meets Sunday with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to prepare for upcoming talks on the conflict in Sudan's western Darfur region, said officials and diplomats.
President Olusegun Obasanjo is to meet Gadhafi, Sudanese officials and other "brother heads of state to see how to jump start" Darfur peace talks set to restart in the Nigerian capital Abuja on Thursday, said Obasanjo spokeswoman Remi Oyo.
Oyo said the one day meeting would take place in Tripoli.
Sudan's ambassador to Nigeria, Abdel Rahim Kalil, said he expected the leaders of Chad, Sudan and Egypt to also be present at the summit, although Oyo would not comment on that.
Darfur's main rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Army, indicated it would not attend the Libya summit, although it said it had been invited.
"We don't have time to go there without knowing why we're going there," said U.K. based SLA spokesman Abdul Latif.
The other rebel group in Darfur, the Justice and Equality Movement, said it had not been asked to join the talks in Libya.
The two non Arab rebel movements took up arms in February 2003 against government installations, saying they wanted a bigger share of power and Sudan's resources.
The conflict has since grown into a counterinsurgency in which pro government Arab militiamen have raped and killed non Arab villagers.
At least 70000 refugees have died since March because of poor conditions in camps in the Darfur region, the United Nations' World Health Organization said on Friday.
The talks next week in Abuja are to be brokered by the African Union, which Obasanjo currently heads.
A previous round of talks in Abuja broke down last month, with rebels saying Sudan's government was seeking unreasonable security concessions from them.
Sudan's government blamed the United States for encouraging rebel intransigence, after U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said Sudan's government and allied Arab militia had committed acts of genocide against Darfur's non Arab villagers.
On Friday, Obasanjo said his country would deploy 4500 peacekeeping troops to Darfur by the end of November.
The 53 nation African Union already has about 300 unarmed military observers in Darfur to monitor a regularly violated April cease fire agreement.
The Sudanese government is holding separate peace talks in Kenya to end another conflict, 21 years of fighting with southern rebels that has left more than 2 million dead.
Those talks broke off for the month of Ramadan on Saturday.
Peace talks between Darfur's rebels and the Sudanese government, which had been scheduled to restart in Nigeria next week, have been moved to the Libyan capital Tripoli, the African Union's chairman said Friday.
President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, who as the AU's current chairman hosted a first round of talks in Abuja in August and September, announced the switch at a briefing on the crisis for western ambassadors, his office said.
"Talks on Darfur earlier slated for Abuja had to be switched to Tripoli to secure the attendance of neighbouring countries whose cooperation was crucial to lasting peace," it said in a statement, without elaborating.
Although the text did not say when the talks were due to restart, an official in the Nigerian president's office told AFP that they will resume in Tripoli on October 21.
The previous round in Abuja was suspended for one month on September 18.
Sudan's neighbours Chad and Libya are seen as having a role to play in bringing the conflict travel to Tripoli on Sunday to meet Libyan leader Moamer Khadafi, Sudanese President Omar al Beshir and Chadian and Egyptian representatives for an AU mini summit on the fighting.
Sudan's government said Tuesday that it will accept an invitation to a "mini summit" this month convened by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on the crisis in Sudan's western Darfur region.
Libyan Foreign Minister Abdel Rahman Shalqam said Gadhafi wants the Oct 21 summit in the Libyan city of Sirte to deal with both the humanitarian and political aspects of the crisis in Darfur, where fighting has killed 50000 people and driven another 1.4 million from their homes.
In addition to Sudanese President Omar el Bashir, Shalqam said Gadhafi also invited leaders of Darfur's two rebel groups and the presidents of Egypt, Chad and Nigeria.
Majzoub Khalifa, the head of the Sudanese government delegation to the peace talks with Darfur rebels, said in a statement that Sudan would attend the meeting, but did not say whether el Bashir himself would lead the delegation.
"The president has welcomed the holding of this summit, and a presidential delegation will be there," he said.
Khalifa said the government was sending the delegation "in support of the African Union and also to keep this issue within the African and Sudanese context, without any foreign intervention."
The third day of peace talks on the crisis in Sudan's Darfur region adjourned Wednesday morning hardly an hour into the discussions in Nigerian capital Abuja, after the African Union (AU) mediators asked for more time to prepare a document on security.
"The document on security when prepared, shall be tabled for discussion" later in the afternoon, Mohammed Yusuf, a staff of humanitarian affair to the ongoing talks in Abuja, told reporters.
He said all sides required a little time to study the document but shall do so quickly to improve the situation in Darfur.
The disagreement on the sensitive security issue has led to the collapse of the first round of peace talks in Abuja a month ago.
However, "all the parties now have better positions," said Yusuf.
The decision to table the issue of security at Wednesday's talks was contrary to indications Tuesday that the issue of politics, involving power and wealth sharing, shall be tackled.
Ahmed Tugod, spokesmen for the Justice and Equality Movement ( JEM), one of the two rebel groups in Darfur, said at that time Wednesday will witness a "declaration on principles."
"It's better to focus on, immediately, the political issue we are looking for ,we want to make a breakthrough," Tugod said.
He added the talks now focused on the political issue, because the first round, which ran between Aug 23 and Sept 17, concentrated on humanitarian and security issues but "took a lot of time and ended in a deadlock."
Prior to Wednesday's talks, Ibrahim Mohammed Ibrahim, spokesmen for the Sudanese government, reaffirmed the willingness of his government to talk the political issue with the rebels as the issue of power and wealth sharing contained in the federal system of Sudan had been developing since 1994.
"Every state has its autonomy with a self government and constitution with little guidelines from the federal government," he said.
Delegates said both sides were ready for political talks Thursday.
Clashes in Sudan's Darfur flared up in February 2003, and has so far caused thousands of deaths and sent about one million fleeing to neighboring Chad or internally displaced.
Blair urges for expansion of African monitoring forces in Sudan's Darfur Visiting British Prime Minister Tony Blair stressed here Wednesday the importance to expand the monitoring forces the African Union (AU) has deployed in Darfur in western Sudan.
Blair made the call at a press conference held at the end of his several hour visit to Sudan.
Blair told reporters that the African monitoring forces must be expanded by sending thousands of troops to ensure ceasefire agreement and access of true information on the situation in Darfur.
He added that he would hold a meeting in Addis Abbaba, Ethiopia with Nigerian president and current AU Chairman Olusegun Obasanjo to map out an urgent plan to send more African troups to Darfur.
The prime minister called on the Sudanese government to commit to the humanitarian protocol it reached with the Darfur rebels in Nigerian capital of Abuja in September and to help humanitarian aid reach affected people of Darfur.
Khartoum must take serious steps to implement the United Nations resolutions on Darfur and specify the areas for its army and the militias in the region, said Blair.
The Sudanese government has agreed to withdraw its military forces to their barracks and to send police forces to take their places, he said.
The prime minister denied that any of the European countries has desire to send troops to Darfur, stressing the capability of the African forces to control the situation in Darfur.
The international community will provide financial and logistic support for the African forces in Darfur, he said.
Blair described his talks with Sudanese officials as constructive, urging the conflicting sides in Darfur to fulfill their commitments within a week or a month.
He, meanwhile, stressed the importance of reaching a comprehensive peace in southern Sudan by the end of this year, saying the peace in the south will be a key for solving the Darfur crisis because it will provide a national government which is honest and balanced.
