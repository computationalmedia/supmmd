Massachusetts lawmakers are pushing a bill that would allow certain pharmacists in the state to dispense the "morning after pill" without a prescription and require hospitals to offer it to rape victims, setting up a debate on a hot button social issue that could present problems for Governor Mitt Romney as he mulls a presidential bid.
When he ran for governor in 2002, Romney told Planned Parenthood that he supported expanding access to the emergency contraception pill, a high dose of hormones that women can take to prevent pregnancy up to five days after sex.
But he didn't elaborate, and Monday a spokesman for Romney said the governor was not prepared to disclose his position on the measure because he wants to examine it if it reaches his desk.
The Legislature's joint public health committee will hold a hearing on the bill Wednesday, and may vote as soon as May 4 to send it to the House and Senate floors.
The Senate approved the bill last year, but former House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, a devout Catholic, blocked a House vote.
Representative Peter Koutoujian, the Waltham Democrat who co chairs the public health panel and backs the bill, said the bill has a better chance of passing this time around.
Sixteen senators and 65 representatives have co sponsored the bill.
"Certainly the leadership is more supportive of this.
Maybe it comes down to where the governor stands, and whether we have two thirds in support," Koutoujian said, referring to the margin necessary for the House and Senate to override a Romney veto.
"But we seem to have a window of opportunity here, and I'm hopeful."
On a number of social issues, including gay marriage, sex education, and embryonic stem cell research, Romney has struggled to find a sliver of ground between the views of the Bay State's moderate voters and the conservative voters who wield tremendous influence in the Republican presidential primaries.
He faces a similar challenge on the question of emergency contraception.
The Catholic Church and other abortion opponents oppose the pill because they believe it quashes a nascent human life by preventing the implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus.
Abortion rights groups argue it will reduce the number of abortions by preventing unwanted pregnancies, and insist it is especially important for women who have been raped or abused.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the emergency contraception pill as a form of prescription birth control in 1998.
But the FDA has refused to grant a request by the pill's manufacturer to sell it over the counter, despite the overwhelming vote of an advisory panel in 2003 recommending the move.
In the absence of federal action, six states Maine, California, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, and New Mexico have allowed pharmacists to dispense it without a prescription.
Manufactured by Barr Laboratories, the emergency contraception pill, called Plan B, could prevent as many as 1.5 million unintended pregnancies a year and prevent as many as 700000 abortions nationally, according to medical and women's organizations that petitioned the FDA in 2003.
The emergency contraception pill is not to be confused with RU 486, which is used to end pregnancies up to 49 days after the beginning of the last menstrual cycle.
Under the Massachusetts legislation, only pharmacists who have gone through a special training program and have a collaborative agreement with a doctor would be allowed to distribute the emergency contraception pill without a prescription.
The training program would be approved by the commissioner of public health to ensure what the legislation calls "quality assurance."
The collaborative agreement would ensure that the pharmacist works with a doctor overseeing how the pill is dispensed.
Most of the state's hospitals 12 out of 71, according to a 2004 poll by abortion rights groups already offer the pill to rape victims, but the bill would require that all of them do so.
"It's very, very important to women, particularly women who are victims of domestic violence.
It's like being a victim twice if you've been raped, you go to a hospital, and you aren't offered emergency contraception," said Dianne Luby, the executive director of the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts.
"It's just a question of access.
Not every single woman lives within a couple of blocks of a pharmacy, and not every woman can easily access their doctor over the weekend."
Marie Sturgis, legislative director of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, described the effects of the emergency contraception pill as "a chemical abortion."
"This is going to abort that embryo that is trying to implant in the uterus," Sturgis said.
Although the pill may work for up to five days after sex, its effectiveness declines over time.
If taken within 24 hours, it is 95 percent effective in preventing pregnancy, according to Planned Parenthood.
On a questionnaire Planned Parenthood gave to the gubernatorial candidates in 2002, Romney answered "yes" to the question, "Do you support efforts to increase access to emergency contraception?"
Romney says he personally opposes abortion, but on the questionnaire he also expressed support for "the substance of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade" and promised not to change the status quo on abortion in Massachusetts.

A pharmacist in Illinois has filed a lawsuit challenging an order by Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich requiring pharmacies to dispense birth control and emergency contraceptives without delay.
The pharmacist, Luke Vander Bleek, 42, says in his lawsuit that the order violates state law by requiring pharmacists to act against ethical and religious beliefs that oppose morning after birth control pills.
The lawsuit, filed Wednesday, is the third contesting the governor's action.
"I'm not up on a soap box in the pharmacy screaming out 'This is not to be done,"' said Vander Bleek, who owns two pharmacies in Morrison and Prophetstown, about 130 miles west of Chicago.
"I simply don't want to be involved in it."
Vander Bleek said he conscientiously objected to the order, which was issued in April after two women reported that a drugstore in Chicago would not fill their prescriptions for morning after pills.
"Prior to this rule, I had always practiced pharmacy using my judgment and my conscience and the law as my guide," he said.
"Here comes this grenade thrown in here that says, 'You're going to have to do things that are morally objectionable."'
Abby Ottenhoff, a spokeswoman for Blagojevich, a Democrat, said the governor issued the order to make sure women had access to the health care their doctors prescribed.
"They've chosen to be in the field of providing contraceptives," Ottenhoff said.
"They don't have the right to pick and choose who they're going to serve."
Vander Bleek, who is represented by Americans United for Life, a conservative bioethics law firm based in Chicago, said he had not dispensed or stocked emergency contraceptives and did not plan to do so.
No one has come to his pharmacy with such prescriptions since the order was issued, he said.
"Simply stated, this individual's interest in getting this prescription is not greater than my interest in preserving my right to conscientious objection," he said.
Also on Wednesday, a nurse in Illinois filed a lawsuit against Eastern Illinois University, where she used to work, claiming she was denied a promotion because she objected to dispensing the morning after pill.
Vicki Woodard, a spokeswoman for the university, said the reason that the nurse, Andrea Nead, was not hired for the position had nothing to do with her opinion of the morning after pill.
One of the two people hired for the position also objects to dispensing it, Woodard said.
The American Center for Law and Justice, the conservative legal group representing Nead, represents six pharmacists in a separate lawsuit against the governor's order.
Another suit was filed by the Center for Law and Religious Freedom, representing a Chicago pharmacist.
EMERGENCY BIRTH CONTROLSINCE THE late 1990s, women in need of a "morning after" emergency contraceptive have been able to get one by doctor's prescription.
But the pill ndash actually a short series of high dose birth control pills ndash loses effectiveness with any delay.
Access would be much better if the Food and Drug Administration accepted a proposal ndash endorsed by the FDA's own experts ndash to make emergency contraception available over the counter.
Since political pressure has kept the FDA from doing so, there is need for state legislation that makes Plan B, as the treatment is called, somewhat more available until the FDA sees fit to allow over the counter sales.
Under a bill pending in the Legislature, pharmacists would be allowed to sell Plan B without prescriptions if they undergo special training set up by the state Department of Public Health and establish a relationship with a doctor who would oversee how the pill is dispensed.
Such arrangements are already in place in six other states, including Washington and California.
The training in Washington has focused on Plan B's side effects (nausea and breast tenderness) and informed consent issues.
The bill would also require that all hospital emergency rooms in Massachusetts offer emergency contraception to the victims of rape or sexual assault.
Most emergency rooms in the state already do so.
The bill deserves the support of the Legislature and Governor Romney.
Plan B prevents 89 percent of pregnancies when it is taken within 72 hours of intercourse, either by interfering with ovulation or by blocking fertilization.
In some cases, it might also work by keeping a fertilized egg from implanting in a woman's uterus.
This has kept some opponents of abortion from supporting use of Plan B. Supporters of Plan B say that easier access to it would reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies and abortions.
The legislation has won support from organizations representing women, the medical profession, and pharmacists.
Morning after pills are far from ideal as a means of birth control.
Their effectiveness rate is lower than that of other measures, and they do not prevent sexually transmitted diseases, as condoms do.
But they should be a readily available option for women.
Last year the state Senate passed an emergency contraception bill, but the former House speaker, Thomas M. Finneran, blocked action on it in that chamber.
With Finneran departed, advocates of the bill hope that it will pass both houses.
As a candidate for governor in 2002, Romney answered "yes" to a questionnaire from the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts that asked him whether he supported "efforts to increase access to emergency contraception."
The Legislature should pass the bill and, if it does, Romney should sign it.
It was the kind of election year event that illustrates the power of incumbency.
There were testimonials hailing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's leadership, standing ovations, billboard size video displays of the New York mayor and a chance for him to tell a ballroom filled with abortion rights supporters that in his role as mayor he was going to have the city spend $1 million to help make women aware of the "morning after pill."
Bloomberg, running for a second term, was honored Thursday by Naral Pro Choice New York for creating a program in 2001 that made abortion training available to doctors in residency in city hospitals.
"I wanted to do this myself," said Kelli Conlin, the executive director of the group, as she called the mayor to the stage, "because I wanted you to know from the bottom of our hearts in this organization how much your leadership has meant on this issue."
Bloomberg could not help but smile.
"I can at least go back and report that this is a friendly crowd," he said.
Early polls have indicated that Bloomberg, a Republican running in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, could be vulnerable to a popular Democratic candidate, even though the Democrats seeking the nomination have been struggling to find a message that resonates.
Bloomberg's party affiliation and his reluctance to criticize Republicans in Congress over issues that many say are important to New York leave him open to criticism and more.
But Thursday, Bloomberg had a chance to tell an important constituency that he is more in sync with their thinking than with that of many Republicans leading the party nationally, especially on abortion.
The mayor picked an issue availability of the morning after pill that is being debated across the country.
"He has stepped into the fray, sided with science and women's health, and is pushing a program that will directly reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in our city," said Robert Jaffee, deputy director of Naral Pro Choice New York.
"I make this promise," Bloomberg said at the meeting.
"As mayor and as a private citizen, I will continue to do what I can to make a difference, whether in the city, in Albany, in Washington or anywhere that the rights or our daughters, our sisters, our friends or our colleagues are threatened."
After the ceremony, Conlin was asked if the unqualified praise for the mayor amounted to an endorsement.
She said the group's endorsement committee had not yet met, but added, "We are happy and proud to stand with him today."
Senate Democrats on Thursday questioned Dr Lester M. Crawford, President Bush's choice to lead the Food and Drug Administration, about why the agency had so far refused to allow over the counter sales of Plan B, the morning after pill.
"What has disturbed many of us is what appears is political interference in a scientific process," said Sen Hillary Rodham Clinton, D N.Y. "We rely on the FDA for everything we take, and I am hopeful that we will reverse what appears to be a dangerous slide into political opinion as opposed to scientific evidence."
Sens Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Patty Murray of Washington State and Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland expressed similar concerns.
Crawford said that the FDA's consideration of the morning after pill's application was delayed because of its complexity, not because of political interference.
"I can assure you that this decision will not be based on politics," Crawford said.
"It will be based on science."
Crawford appeared before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee as part of his confirmation process to become the FDA commissioner.
Bush nominated him in February after Crawford had served nearly a year as the agency's acting commissioner.
The committee is expected to vote on his nomination on April 13.
His confirmation is widely expected.
Several of the committee's Democrats said that they wanted answers from Crawford about the agency's actions on the morning after pill before they voted on his nomination.
Crawford promised to give them a more detailed explanation.
The FDA's staff and an advisory committee had earlier recommended that the morning after pill known as Plan B be approved for sale on pharmacy shelves.
But in an unusual move, Dr Steven Galson, acting director of the agency's center for drug evaluation and research, rejected the application.
Galson said that the application failed to deal with concerns that the easy availability of the contraceptives might lead teenagers to engage in riskier sex.
The FDA has rarely asked an applicant to study whether the availability of a cure might lead some people to engage in risky behavior.
Galson said politics did not play a role in his decision.
Plan B's maker, Barr Laboratories, has since applied to sell the pill "behind the counter."
People seeking the medicine would need to prove that they are 16 or older.
Those under 16 would need a prescription.
No pill is presently sold this way, although nicotine patches are not supposed to be sold to those under the age of 18.
The FDA was supposed to issue a decision on the later application by January but did not do so.
Crawford said that missing such deadlines was unusual.
He was asked when the new decision would be issued.
"Is it days or weeks?"
Kennedy asked.
"I wouldn't want to say days, I would say weeks," Crawford answered.
He later said that he could not guarantee a decision before the committee voted on his nomination.
Crawford said that the agency "had no real dispute" with the drug's label at this point.
He also repeatedly stated that the drug's approval had simply been delayed.
Some on the panel expressed concerns about the many drug safety scandals over the last year.
News that antidepressants and some popular pain pills have lethal side effects has led to criticism that the agency is not sufficiently vigilant in its regulation of drugs.
Some in Congress have proposed a separate drug safety agency that would monitor side effects of approved medicines.
Crawford said that he was increasing the budget and the staff of the agency's drug safety office, and he promised to make the group independent of the agency's new drug reviewers.
New drug reviewers "may have an affinity with the drug that probably doesn't look good, at a bare minimum.
So we're going to be making a separation," he said.
The agency has been criticized recently for convening advisory committees filled with experts who have financial ties to drug makers.
Crawford said that the vetting and disclosure of such ties will change.
Crawford was also asked whether he approved of drug imports.
"As far as being safe, that worries me a lot," he answered.
Crawford also said that he was working with the National Institutes of Health to establish a registry of all human clinical trials.
Medical experts have called for a registry in the wake of disclosures that drug companies often keep trials secret if the results reflect poorly on their drugs.
"We have heard the unalloyed message from the public that they want to know about those clinical trials, they want to be able to read about them," Crawford said.
"So that's a charge to keep and we will move forward as best we can."
President Bush's nominee to lead the Food and Drug Administration is being blocked from Senate confirmation by two Democrats who said Wednesday that they would hold up a vote until the agency settled the long delayed question of whether an emergency contraceptive could be sold over the counter.
The Democrats, Sens Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Patty Murray of Washington, met with the nominee, Lester M. Crawford,on Wednesday to discuss what they regard as foot dragging on the issue of the so called morning after pill.
An expert panel of scientists recommended over the counter sales in December 2003, but the agency has yet to issue a final ruling.
"I'm prepared to hold it for as long as it takes to get a decision made," Clinton said.
She added, "From everything we're able to determine, the agency has substituted politics and ideology for science and facts."
Crawford could not be reached, and an agency spokeswoman, Kathleen Quinn, said the FDA would have no comment.
But at a hearing last month, Crawford told senators the decision on the contraceptive "will not be based on politics."
He did not say then when a final decision would be made, nor did he do so on Wednesday, Murray said.
"It was very frustrating and very unsatisfactory," she said, adding, "I did not get any timeline at all for a decision and there was no new information."
The hold complicates the future of the food and drug agency at a time when it is already being criticized for its handling of several drug safety scandals.
Studies revealing the potentially lethal side effects of some antidepressants and popular pain medicines, like the Merck drug Vioxx, have prompted critics to charge that the agency is not vigilant enough in protecting consumers.
The White House had hoped Crawford, who is the acting commissioner of the agency, would help tamp some of that criticism.
"Dr Les Crawford is a well qualified candidate," a White House spokeswoman, Erin Healy, said Wednesday, adding that the Bush administration "will continue to work with the Senate to ensure his confirmation."
Crawford has doctorates in veterinary medicine and pharmacology.
But ever since his nomination in February, Crawford has been confronted with questions not only about the safety scandals, but also about the emergency contraceptive, also known as Plan B. The senior Democrat on the Senate Health Education Labor Committee, Sen Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, has also raised questions about the morning after pill.
Kennedy, who attended Wednesday's meeting, has decided against putting a hold on Crawford's nomination, a spokeswoman said.
But the spokeswoman, Laura Capps, said Kennedy "conveyed today that he is hopeful that the FDA will do the right thing and make a decision on this product, and until it is settled he believes it's doubtful that Dr Crawford can be confirmed."
Though Clinton and Murray believe the drug should be made available over the counter, both said that their interest was solely in getting a decision from the FDA and that they would remove the hold regardless of the outcome.
Plan B, manufactured by Barr Laboratories, was approved for use by prescription in June 1999.
Consisting of two pills, it is intended to be taken in the 72 hours after unprotected sex, either when regular contraception fails or is skipped.
But advocates for women's health said selling it by prescription hampered its usefulness, because it was difficult for women to see their doctors quickly enough to get a prescription.
Opponents of the pill, including religious conservatives, have said it will encourage sexual promiscuity.
But in December 2003, two committees of expert advisers to the food and drug agency, meeting jointly, voted, 23 4, to recommend over the counter sales.
The agency typically follows the advice of its expert advisers, but the decision has been delayed on several occasions.
More recently, Barr Laboratories has applied to sell the pill "behind the counter", women seeking to buy it would have to prove they are 16 or older while those under 16 would need a prescription.
The agency was supposed to issue a decision on that in January, but missed a deadline.
At last month's hearing, before the Senate Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions, Crawford said missing such deadlines was unusual.
Asked when the new decision would be issued, he said: "I wouldn't want to say days.
I would say weeks."
But he said he could not guarantee a decision before April 13, when the committee is expected to vote on his nomination.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, April 8: When a president picks his administration officials, the opposing political party can't expect to be thrilled with the selections.
Right now, Democrats in the Senate are trying to block the nominations of three men chosen by George W. Bush for important posts: John Bolton for U.N. ambassador, Stephen Johnson for head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Dr Lester Crawford for commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
They have excellent reasons for opposition in each case, but some reasons are more excellent than others.
Bolton stands out because he is not only bad in a policy sense, but also unqualified for the post to which he's been named.
At a minimum, the U.S. representative to the United Nations should be a person who believes it is a good idea.
Bolton has never made secret his disdain for the United Nations, for multilateralism, and for consensus seeking diplomacy in general.
When the Senate Foreign Relations Committee begins taking testimony on Bolton's nomination next week, it is also expected to hear other charges about his fitness, like allegations that when he was undersecretary of state for arms control, he tried to distort intelligence reports by intimidating analysts who disagreed with him.
After the invasion of Iraq, complaints that top advisers to the president had attempted to make intelligence reports conform to a preconceived conclusion about Saddam Hussein's weapons programs were often aimed in Bolton's direction.
All of this is very much to the point.
When the country chooses an ambassador to the United Nations, it ought to avoid picking someone whose bullying style of leadership symbolizes everything that created the current estrangement between the United States and most of the world.
One of the goals of Bush's second term was supposed to be rapprochement with other nations, whose assistance the United States desperately needs to curb the proliferation of the real weapons of mass destruction.
Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee are fighting to actually kill Bolton's nomination, all eyes are on Lincoln Chafee, the moderate Republican swing vote who has a record of being very supportive of the United Nations.
In the case of Crawford and Johnson, a few senators are threatening to block what would be easy confirmations by putting a hold on each nomination before it goes to the Senate floor.
The right to block a nomination, like the right to filibuster a bill on the Senate floor, is one of the few tools the minority party has for affecting public policy.
But it needs to be used with discretion.
Johnson, in particular, seems like a bad choice for such a fight.
His main drawback is that he is unlikely to put up the slightest resistance to Bush's policies, which have not been helpful in protecting the nation's clean air and water.
Unfortunately, that will be the case whether this particular nomination goes through or not, and the president clearly has the capacity to find a less qualified yes man for the job.
Sens Barbara Boxer of California and Ben Nelson of Florida are threatening to stall Johnson's confirmation unless he promises to end a suspended Florida study in which families would be paid to allow researchers to study the effects of pesticides on their children a macabre investigation co sponsored by the American Chemistry Council.
The idea that the EPA would pay families to continue exposing their children to potentially dangerous chemicals is on its face outrageous and made worse by the study's ghoulish acronym, Cheers, for Children's Environmental Exposure Research Study.
But the study has already been stopped, pending a review.
It would have been a good sign of independence if Johnson had called a complete halt, but there seems little likelihood that the study will ever be revived.
This seems like a weak reason to stop a Senate vote.
In the case of the FDA, Sens Hillary Clinton of New York and Patty Murray of Washington are threatening to keep the nomination from the floor unless Crawford prompts his agency to make a long delayed decision on whether the so called morning after pill may be sold over the counter.
Their cause is righteous.
If taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex, the pills can end unwanted pregnancies so making them readily available could drastically cut down on the number of abortions.
Two committees of expert advisers voted overwhelmingly in favor of selling the medication over the counter, but the FDA has failed to do anything.
Another proposal, which would limit its sale to women over 16, has also been pending.
Crawford has been the deputy or acting commissioner during a very troubled period for the drug agency.
He presided over fiascos involving cox 2 painkillers, antidepressants, and other drugs.
He is clearly afraid to let his agency make a decision on the morning after pill that will get him in hot water with social conservatives or with those who believe that the FDA should be run on the basis of science, not theology.
That timidity doesn't suggest that he would impose needed reform in other areas.
The Senate should vote on Crawford and defeat his nomination on the merits.
If the Democratic senators are going to choose a disastrous Bush nomination to block, our choice is Bolton's.
Only one third of British teens use condoms consistently, a health charity said in a report Thursday warning that ignorance about sexual health was putting youth at risk.
Out of 1300 people aged 16 to 18 surveyed for the Brook study, a majority said they had used a preservative at least once, but only 37 percent of males said they used them consistently and only 30 percent made their partners use them.
"Condom confusion" increased their risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) since the devices were used primarily to prevent pregnancy rather than for health protection, and were often "applied too late, or removed too early," Brook said.
General ignorance about sexual health risks was widespread: 52 percent of respondents thought chlamydia affected only women, and 31 percent thought sexually transmitted infections could be caught from a toilet seat.
Fifty four percent also did not know that the "morning after" contraceptive pill could remain effective for up to 72 hours after sexual intercourse.
There was also a significant gap between teens' general concern about STIs and HIV/AIDS, and whether they considered themselves personally at risk of disease.
While 89 percent of men and 82 percent of women polled expressed general worry, only 61 percent and 50 percent, respectively, thought they might be at risk.
Jan Barlow, chief executive of Brook, said the report should serve to "focus" attention on young people's sexual health.
"Many (youths) think that STIs are something that happen to other people they simply don't believe that the risk applies to them personally," she said in a statement.
"Britain's sexual health crisis won't go away until this problem is tackled head on in sexual health awareness campaigns and in improved sex and relationships education in schools."
Brook also found that schools were the most frequently cited source of information about STIs much more so than parents, friends or literature.
According to the non profit youth advisory organization, Britain has seen a huge rise in acute STIs since 1995.
Chlamydia cases increased by 190 percent between 1995 and 2003, gonorrhea by 137 percent.
Syphillis, even though it only affects a small number of people, went up by 1062 percent.
The rise in STIs was much higher across the board for young people.
Some pharmacists around the country are refusing to fill prescriptions for birth control and morning after pills, saying that dispensing the medications violates their personal moral or religious beliefs.
The trend has opened a new front in the nation's battle over reproductive rights, sparking an intense debate over the competing rights of pharmacists to refuse to participate in something they consider repugnant versus a woman's right to get medications her doctor has prescribed.
It has triggered pitched political battles in State Houses across the nation as politicians seek to pass laws either to protect pharmacists from being penalized or force them to carry out their duties.
"This is a very big issue that's just beginning to surface," said Steven H. Aden of the Christian Legal Society's Center for Law and Religious Freedom in Annandale, Va., which defends pharmacists.
"More and more pharmacists are becoming aware of their right to conscientiously refuse to pass objectionable medications across the counter.
We are on the very front edge of a wave that's going to break not too far down the line."
An increasing number of clashes are occurring.
Pharmacists often risk dismissal or other disciplinary action to stand up for their beliefs, while shaken teen age girls and women desperately call their doctors, frequently late at night, after being turned away by sometimes lecturing men and women in white coats.
"There are pharmacists who will only give birth control pills to a woman if she's married.
There are pharmacists who mistakenly believe contraception is a form of abortion and refuse to prescribe it to anyone," said Adam Sonfield of the Alan Guttmacher Institute in New York, which tracks reproductive issues.
"There are even cases of pharmacists holding prescriptions hostage, where they won't even transfer it to another pharmacy when time is of the essence."
That's what happened to Kathleen Pulz and her husband, who panicked when the condom they were using broke.
Their fear spiked when the Walgreens pharmacy near their home in Milwaukee refused to fill an emergency prescription for the morning after pill.
"I couldn't believe it," said Pulz, 43 , who with her husband had long ago decided they could not afford a fifth child.
"How can they make that decision for us?
I was outraged.
At the same time, I was sad that we had to do this.
But I was scared.
I didn't know what we were going to do."
Supporters of pharmacists' rights see the trend as a welcome expression of personal belief.
Women's groups see it as a major threat to reproductive rights and one of the latest manifestations of the religious right's growing political reach this time into the neighborhood pharmacy.
"This is another indication of the current political atmosphere and climate," said Rachel Laser of the National Women's Law Center in Washington.
"It's outrageous.
It's sex discrimination.
It prevents access to a basic form of health care for women.
We're going back in time."
The issue could intensify further if the Food and Drug Administration approves the sale of the Plan B morning after pill without a prescription a step that would likely make pharmacists the primary gatekeeper.
The question of health care workers refusing to provide certain services first emerged among doctors, nurses and other health care workers over abortions.
The trend began to spread to pharmacists with the approval of the morning after pill and physician assisted suicide in Oregon, with support from such organizations as the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Pharmacists for Life International, which claims 1600 members on six continents, primarily the United States, Canada and Britain.
"Our group was founded with the idea of returning pharmacy to a healing only profession.
What's been going on is the use of medication to stop human life.
That violates the ideal of the Hippocratic Oath that medical practitioners should do no harm," said Karen L. Brauer, the group's president, who was fired from a K Mart pharmacy in Delhi, Ohio, for refusing to fill birth control prescriptions.
No one knows exactly how often that is happenning, but cases have been reported across the country, including in California, Washington, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Texas, New Hampshire, Ohio and North Carolina.
Advocates on both sides say the refusals appear to be spreading, often surfacing only in the rare instances when women file complaints.
Pharmacists are regulated by state laws and can face disciplinary action from licensing boards.
But the only case that has gotten that far involves Neil T. Noesen, who in 2002 refused to fill a University of Wisconsin student's birth control pill prescription at a K Mart in Menomonie, Wis., or transfer the prescription elsewhere.
An administrative judge last month recommended Noesen be required to take ethics classes, alert future employers to his beliefs and pay what could be as much as $20000 to cover the costs of the legal proceedings.
The state pharmacy board will decide whether to impose that penalty next month.
"He's a devout Roman Catholic and believes participating in any action that inhibits or prohibits human life is a sin," said Aden of the Christian Legal Society.
"The rights of pharmacists like him should be respected."
Wisconsin is one of at least 11 states considering "conscience clause" laws that would protect pharmacists like Noesen.
Four states have laws that specifically allow pharmacists to refuse to fill prescriptions that violate their beliefs.
At the same time, at least four states are considering laws that would explicitly require pharmacists to fill all prescriptions.
The American Pharmacists Association recently reaffirmed its policy that pharmacists can refuse to fill prescriptions as long as they make sure customers can get their medications some other way.
"We don't have a profession of robots.
We have a profession of humans.
We have to acknowledge that individual pharmacists have individual beliefs," said Susan Winckler, the association's vice president for policy and communications.
"What we suggest is that they identify those situations ahead of time and have an alternative system set up so the patient has access to their therapy."
The alternative system can include making sure another pharmacist is on duty who can take over or making sure another pharmacy nearby is willing to fill the prescription, Winckler said.
"The key is that it should be seamless and avoids a conflict between the pharmacist's right to step away and the patient's right to obtain their medication," she said.
Brauer, of Pharmacists for Life, defends the right of pharmacists not only to decline to fill prescriptions themselves but also to refuse to refer customers elsewhere or transfer prescriptions.
"That's like saying, 'I don't kill people myself but let me tell you about the guy down the street who does.'
What's that saying?
'I will not off your husband but I know a buddy who will?'
It's the same thing," said Brauer, who now works at hospital pharmacy.
Large pharmacy chains, including Walgreens, Wal Mart and CVS, have instituted similar policies that try to balance pharmacists' and customers' rights.
"We obviously do have pharmacists with individual moral and ethical beliefs.
When it does happen, the pharmacist is asked to notify the manager that they have decided not to fill the prescription, and the manager has the obligation to make sure the customer has access to the prescription by another means," said Tiffany Bruce, a spokesperson for Walgreens.
"We have to respect the pharmacist but we have to also respect the right of the person to receive the prescription."
Women's advocates say such policies are impractical, especially late at night in emergency situations involving the morning after pill, which must be taken within 72 hours.
Even in non urgent cases, poor women have a hard time getting enough time off work or money to go from one pharmacy to another.
Young women, who are often already frightened and unsure of themselves, may simply give up when confronted by a judgmental pharmacist.
"What is a women supposed to do in rural America, in places where there may only be one pharmacy?" asked Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro Choice America, which is launching a campaign Monday to counter the trend.
"It's a slap in the face to women."
By the time Suzanne Richards, 21, finally got another pharmacy to fill her morning after pill prescription after being rejected by a drive through Brooks pharmacy in Laconia, N.H., one late Saturday night in September the 72 hours had long passed.
"When he told me he wouldn't fill it, I just pulled over in the parking lot and started crying," said Richards, a single mother of a 3 year old who runs her own cleaning service.
"I just couldn't believe it.
I was just trying to be responsible."
In the end, Richards turned out not to be pregnant.
Pulz obtained her prescription last June directly from her doctor, though she does not think she was pregnant either.
"I was lucky," Pulz said.
"I can sympathize with someone who feels strongly and doesn't want to be involved.
But they should just step out of the way and not interfere with someone else's decision.
It's just not right."
Increasingly we are governed by ideologies that don't in any way reflect mainstream American thought.
When Congress made its clumsy bull's rush into the Terri Schiavo matter, 70 percent of Americans said it should have stayed out.
Roughly that same number supports life saving stem cell research that is being blunted on the grounds of biblical verses.
Now in several states, including Texas, lawmakers are being urged to equate birth control pills and abortion.
This is a distinction I'm confident a vast majority of American women will classify as ridiculous and/or immaterial.
In Texas, the debate has formed around a bill under whose original language pharmacists could refuse to fill prescriptions for emergency contraception (EC) the so called morning after pill.
House Bill 16 would be appended to current law allowing health professionals to opt out of performing an abortion.
Family planning organizations not only opposed the "conscience clause" on EC but feared that the language could be broadened to include standard birth control pills, as is the case in a handful of states.
Abortion foes, including an organization called Pharmacists for Life, assert that while birth control pills and EC do prevent conception in several ways, they also can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting therefore aborting human life.
With much attention aimed at whether or not his bill would affect birth control pills, bill author Frank Corte, R San Antonio, offered a version that took out references to EC.
Instead, it simply would add pharmacists to the health professionals who can choose not to perform abortions.
But abortion isn't something pharmacists do anyway unless one equates birth control pills and abortions.
If passed, seemingly, a pharmacist could cite HB 16 in refusing to fill out a prescription for EC or contraception.
It is skirmishes like this that ought to get a lot of Americans wondering who is running the country, and to what end.
In a visit to Texas and a stopover in Waco, National Abortion Rights Action League president Nancy Keenan called this the newest front in the war against choice.
It's "not just about a woman's right to choose an abortion," she said.
"It's about denying birth control."
Keenan said her organization has reformulated its own message to put pregnancy prevention at the forefront.
"We've been debating the abortion issue for years and fought it on their (abortion opponents') terms.
Now we're going on the offensive" on behalf of prevention and education.
It is somewhat amazing that anyone would have to bring such issues to the forefront of any debate.
Stand up for contraception, something on which millions of women depend to control their reproductive futures?
You mean people weren't already on their feet?
On this issue and more, average Americans have been planted on the sofa as armies of zeal have dictated debate.
Do Texans think a pharmacist should be able to refuse to fill a prescription for birth control pills?
According to the Texas Poll, 87 percent say no. Something tells me that's not guaranteed to carry the day in Austin.

Nearly one third of sexually active Portuguese girls between the ages of 15 and 19 have taken the "morning after" pill to prevent pregnancy, according to a study published Thursday in the daily Publico.
The study, one of the largest ever carried out into the contraceptive habits of Portuguese women, also found 16 percent of all sexually active girls in this age group do not use any form of birth control at all, the paper said.
Yet fully 83.4 percent of 15 to 19 year old women said they had received information on contraceptives at school, according to the study by the Portuguese Society of Gynecology.
"We have to pay more attention to young women, this is where the greatest potential risks exist," the president of the association, Daniel Pereira da Silva, told the newspaper.
Staunchly Roman Catholic Portugal has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in the European Union.
The study was carried out by the association among 3858 women between the ages of 15 and 49, the paper said.
Providing women with easy access to the emergency contraceptive Plan B did not lead them to engage in more risky sexual behavior, a study of more than 2000 young California women has concluded.
The study did find that women given a supply to keep at home were almost twice as likely to use the drug after unprotected sex as those who had to pick it up at a clinic or pharmacy.
The findings led the study authors to conclude that easy access to Plan B, also called the morning after pill, could cut the number of unwanted pregnancies while posing no apparent risk to women.
The study contradicts a key claim made by opponents of easier access to Plan B at a time when the Food and Drug Administration is preparing to decide on a second application to allow nonprescription sales of the drug.
In an indication of the strong feelings on both sides, advocates of Plan B plan to sit in Friday at FDA headquarters in suburban Bethesda, Md.
Some protesters have called for civil disobedience if the FDA official who rejected the first Plan B application, Steven Galson of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, refuses to meet with them.
The FDA turned down the initial application last May, saying there wasn't enough information on how easy access would affect the sexual behavior of young teens.
"Our findings were that women don't change their sexual behavior when the drug is easily available, but rather that they're more likely to use it if access is easier," said lead author Tina Raine of the Center for Reproductive Health Research and Policy of the University of California, San Francisco.
The study looked at 2117 San Francisco area women ages 15 to 24 who were randomly put into one of three groups.
One third were given the drug to take home, one third were told it could be picked up without a prescription at a clinic, and the final third could get it without a prescription at a pharmacy.
The study found that roughly the same percentage of each group had unprotected sex over a six month period, that incidence of sexually transmitted disease was equal, and that about the same percentage became pregnant.
Nonetheless, about 37 percent of women in the group given Plan B to take home used it at least once during the six months, compared with 21 percent in the clinic access group and 24 percent in the pharmacy access group.
The FDA's initial decision to reject nonprescription sales touched off sharp criticism from FDA's staff and members of its expert advisory panel, among others that the agency was bowing to political pressure from social conservatives.
In a letter to President Bush, 49 members of Congress asked that the application be rejected.
The medical profession does not consider emergency contraception to be an abortion pill like RU 486, or Mifeprex, because Plan B works by preventing a pregnancy from starting rather than ending an existing one.
But some critics of Plan B consider it an abortifacient.
The new study, being published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, supports the position taken by much of the FDA review staff and 23 of 27 members of the FDA advisory panel that the drug could be safely and properly used without a prescription.
After the FDA rejected its initial application, the maker of Plan B, Barr Pharmaceuticals, resubmitted a modified application to address the concerns about teen age users.
The company's new application would make the drug available over the counter for women older than 16, and by prescription only for those who are younger.
Barr spokeswoman Carol Cox said the company still believes the drug can be safely sold on open shelves but would accept a compromise to place Plan B behind the counter.
That would require a pharmacy employee to retrieve the drug, making enforcement of an age restriction easier.
Plan B consists of the synthetic progestin levonorgestrel and is most effective when used within 24 hours of an unprotected sexual encounter.
While the FDA has approved it only for prescription use, six states have passed laws that allow pharmacists to dispense the drug without a prescription after a discussion with the woman.
The University of California study was initiated in part to see whether getting the drug from a pharmacy would be more acceptable to women than getting it from a clinic, and Raine said the results appear to show it was not.
The study was funded by grants from a number of private foundations that invested in the Women's Capital Corporation, which initially developed the drug.
Raine said neither the foundations nor Barr Pharmaceuticals, which supplied the drugs for the women, had any influence over the study.
The first of possibly several bills seeking to let Texas pharmacists "just say no" to filling prescriptions for emergency contraceptives has been filed before the legislative session that begins in January.
Groups opposing the bill, as well as the bill's author, said its language will probably change during the legislative process to accommodate certain concerns.
In its current form, the bill would allow pharmacists to refuse to dispense some birth control pills.
The definition in the bill of emergency contraceptives, commonly called the morning after pill, also fits some nonemergency contraceptives, or birth control pills.
That would not sit well with members of the Texas Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, an organization spokeswoman said.
"This bill would cause women to have to rol the dice every time they went to have a prescription filled," spokeswoman Sarah Wheat said.
The new legislation was filed to allow pharmacists the same protections other Texas health care professionals enjoy, said its author, state Rep Frank Corte Jr., R San Antonio.
Pharmacists are worried that they may face repercussions if they choose to follow their conscience and refuse to serve a customer on moral or ethical grounds, Corte said.
But ifthe bill is passed, it should not stand between a woman and her health care needs, he said.
"Our intent is to affect the prescriptions that terminate pregnancies that's what most of the pharmacists are concerned about," he said.
"We have pharmacists who have received ultimatums from their employers."
In January, pharmacists at an Eckerd Drug Store in Denton denied a morning after pill to a rape victim.
Three pharmacists were fired as a result of that incident.
In March, a CVS pharmacist in North Richland Hills refused to fill Julee Lacey's prescription for birth control pills.
The pharmacist told Lacey that she did not believe in any form of birth control and advised her to go to a nearby Walgreens for assistance, said Lacey, of Fort Worth.
Lacey remembers feeling frustrated.
"I entrust my care to my physician, not my pharmacist," Lacey said.
"We have to consider what could happen if this should go any further.
There are some people who don't believe in trasplants.
I just want to know where they are going to draw the line."
The morning after pill is a higher dose of regular hormonal contraception that works to prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours after intercourse.
When the bill's language is refined, it should only refer to the morning after pill, said state Rep Charles Hopson, D Jacksonville.
Hopson, who is also a pharmacist, said the bill needs to clearly state that patients will be presented with an alternative if a pharmacist refuses to serve them.
"Some of th big chain stores are comfortable with the concept, but they would like to know which pharmacists will fill all prescriptions and which ones will not," Hopson said.
"They also want to make sure that there is some alternative for the patient."
This bill, and similar legislation passed or recently proposed in about a dozen other states, discriminates against women, said Rachel Laser, senior counsel with the National Women's Law Center in Washington, D.C. "If yougo into a profession to assist the medical needs of people, you are not in a position to single out women just because you believe a prescription is something other than what the FDA says it is," Laser said.
"Women find the experience of being denied a prescription humiliating and demoralizing."
Texas Pharmacy Association policy calls for pharmacists to discuss concerns about dispensing prescriptions with their employers before refusing service to a patient, said Jim Martin, the association's executive director.
Pharmacits should make arrangements to ensure that customers can get their prescription filled, even though one pharmacist may object to filling a prescription for a specific drug, Martin said.
The association has not formulated a position on this legislation, Martin said.
But, "Our position is that a pharmacist has a right to fill or not fill a prescription," Martin said.
The Texas Alliance for Life supports the legislation, said Joe Pojman, executiv director.
"My basic concern remains that the pharmacist ought to be able to conscientiously object to participate in something that is the potential taking of human life," he said.
"I'm very concerned that women get the proper health care, but I'm also concerned with the health care providers."

This editorial appeared in Saturday's Los Angeles Times: A strong conviction that teenagers should not have sex can leave no room for reality like the fact that many teenagers do have sex, no matter what society or their elders say.
The Bush administration's simplistic policies for complicated and difficult family planning problems like teen pregnancies looked naive four years ago, their continued application in light of ongoing research looks ridiculous.
Most parents certainly agree with President Bush that teen sex is a bad idea.
But even though adults may hector endlessly, an estimated 800000 teen age girls still become pregnant every year.
The administration's response has been to sink millions of dollars into abstinence only education, depleting funds from programs that provide contraception.
No surprise then that the administration argues that allowing adolescents easy access to the morning after pill would only confuse its abstinence message.
So earlier this year, when a Food and Drug Administration panel recommended that emergency contraception be available without a prescription, a top agency official overruled the scientists.
In most states the drug has stayed off limits to everyone teens and adults who can't get to a doctor within 72 hours after unprotected sex or can't afford one.
A recent study by the University of Pittsburgh Medical School found that teens who had emergency contraception on hand were not more likely to have unprotected sex.
They were, however, more likely to use the drug correctly to prevent pregnancy.
This study confirms other findings and is one reason why most obstetricians and gynecologists back easy access.
The drug's makers are again asking for FDA approval, this time they propose to sell Plan B (the drug's trade name) only to people 16 and older without restrictions.
Younger teens would have to consult a physician.
The FDA could decide on the request in the coming months.
This time maybe science and reality will trump moral certainty.
Nine women protesting the Food and Drug Administration's position on the emergency contraceptive Plan B were arrested Friday when they blocked entry to the agency's Rockville, Md., headquarters.
The women, part of a noisy protest in favor of making the morning after pill available without a prescription, were taken away by officers of the Department of Homeland Security and charged with disorderly conduct.
The protesters said they wanted to speak with Steven Galson, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, who in May rejected an application to allow Plan B to be sold over the counter.
FDA staff reviewers and an advisory panel of outside experts had strongly recommended approval, saying the emergency contraceptive could be safely sold without a prescription.
Friday's protest came as the agency is preparing to rule later this month on a second application by Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc. to make Plan B more easily accessible.
That proposal would allow the drug to be sold to women over 16 without a prescription but would require a doctor's order for girls below that age.
One of the protest organizers, Alex Leader from New York, said the demonstrators opposed any age restrictions and are concerned that the agency will not approve the new application at all.
"We don't trust the FDA at this point," Leader said.
"The Bush administration is playing to its social conservatives by not approving Plan B, even though the experts say it's safe.
Women need this drug available now."
FDA officials said Galson was not available to meet the women but acting Deputy Commissioner Janet Woodcock would be willing to see five of the demonstrators.
They rejected the offer.
About 40 protesters, mostly from Florida and New York, took part in the demonstration.
Three representatives of Concerned Women for America, which opposes easier access to Plan B, were also present.
Wendy Wright, CWA's policy director, said she hopes "the FDA won't base its decision on stunts like this."
She said allowing nonprescription sales "would be simply disastrous."
"You could have a 40 year old man who is committing statutory rape on a 14 year old simply going in and picking up Plan B himself.
An age limit won't stop anyone."
The Bush administration has been cool to the expanded use of emergency contraception, which some conservatives see as a form of abortion.
This week, the Justice Department issued guidelines for treating rape victims that make no mention of emergency contraception, leading to criticism from women's health groups and others that a standard precaution for rape victims was being ignored.
A department spokesman said the new guidelines do not " supersede the many state, local and tribal protocols that are currently in practice."
Kelly Mangan, a National Organization for Women activist from Florida who was among those arrested, said the group has pledges from 2000 other women to break the law by sharing their prescription purchased Plan B with women who need it but have no prescription.
Studies have shown that emergency contraception works for about 72 hours after unprotected sex but is best used within 24 hours.
The need for speed is a key argument made by advocates of easier access.
Also on Friday, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists called on the FDA to approve the new application.
"ACOG and other organizations have estimated that greater access to emergency contraceptives could cut the U.S. unintended pregnancy and abortion rates in half," the group said in a statement.
This editorial appeared in Friday's Los Angeles Times: Only 40 years ago, within the memory of millions of Americans, birth control could not be legally sold in some states, even to married couples.
If President Bush and his allies in Congress are successful, the future could look much like that past.
For some Bush supporters, religious beliefs about when life begins or about interfering with "natural law" justify limiting access to common forms of birth control.
The motivation for others may be disapproval of sex outside of marriage by adults as well as teens.
Whatever the impetus, the emerging results are astonishing.
As part of abstinence only sex education, which the president champions and taxpayers now fund to the tune of $170 million annually, U.S. teens are being taught a bunch of hooey.
A recent congressional report found the program's materials warn that touching another's genitals "can result in pregnancy" and that condoms fail to prevent HIV transmission one third of the time.
Actually, studies find that condoms are nearly always effective in blocking HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases if used properly (and we hope we don't need to refute the first assertion).
Giving teens false and misleading information is bad enough.
More pernicious is the administration's reluctance to back international AIDS prevention programs that distribute condoms, a reluctance that could cost millions of Asians and Africans their lives.
The policy is utterly inexplicable, unless it is to placate those who think condoms could encourage adults to have sex.
The same logic is behind "refusal" laws.
Twelve states now allow pharmacists who oppose contraception to refuse to fill prescriptions for birth control, including the "morning after pill."
Sen Rick Santorum, R Pa., plans to reintroduce his bill from last year to extend that right nationwide.
The religious right's fingerprints also can be seen on the Justice Department's first ever guidebook, released last fall, on treating sexual assault victims.
It is an otherwise laudable effort to help win more rape cases, outlining in 140 graphic pages the best practices for evidence collection, forensic analysis and victim support.
For instance, six pages detail testing protocols for sexually transmitted disease, treatment and psychological counseling.
But the section on "Pregnancy Risk Evaluation and Care" is a scant half page of euphemisms and generalities.
Omitted from the final version was draft language about the effectiveness of emergency contraception in preventing pregnancy.
The morning after pill acts by impeding ovulation, fertilization and implantation.
To most doctors, it is not a method of abortion.
But those who believe that life begins at conception think it is, and Justice officials apparently are seeking to appease them.
So, it seems, is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is stalling a decision on whether to make the morning after pill available nationwide without a prescription.
Opponents claim that easy access would encourage promiscuity, despite data to the contrary from states such as California, where the pill is more freely available.
Surely this backward future is not what most Bush supporters thought they voted for last fall.
Some see easy access to emergency contraception as a way to drastically reduce teen pregnancy, already on the decline in the United States since the early 1990s.
Others worry that its long term effects on young women are unknown or argue that the drug, also known as the "morning after pill," encourages teens to have sex.
Ultimately, it will be up to Food and Drug Administration officials to decide: Should older teens be able to buy emergency contraception without a prescription?
Earlier this year, the FDA denied one drug company's request to sell its brand of emergency contraception to anyone.
Now that company, Barr Pharmaceuticals, has submitted a second proposal to sell its Plan B brand to people 16 and older, but to require anyone younger than that to consult a physician.
The company expects a decision next year.
Sale without a prescription have received support from both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and American Medical Association.
Such access, some argue, would make it easier to get emergency contraception on evenings and weekends, allowing more women to take it in the recommended 72 hour window after unprotected sex.
Others, including some young women, see it as a way for teens who don't want their parents to know they're having sex to help prevent unwanted pregnancy.
"Kids are going to end up having kids because they're hiding from their parents, they're too scared to tell them," said a 17 year old in New York City.
She asked that her name not be used because her parents don't know she used the morning after pill in April.
The young woman is a patient of Dr Bernadith Russell, the attending physician at Long Island Hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department who also works in private practice at teen clinics in Brooklyn.
She says the topic of unplanned pregnancy and emergency contraception comes up with her patients nearly every day.
But few want to discuss it with their parents or use insurance to buy emergency contraception out of fear their parents will find out.
"I can't begin to say how much of a barrier that is," Russell says.
However, a physician who opposes over the counter sale of emergency contraception fears that young women would skip regular visits to the gynecologist if they didn't need to see a doctor to get it.
"They're not going to get their pap smears, they're not going to get screened for sexually transmitted disease," says Dr Gene Rudd, a gynecologist who serves as associate executive director of the Tennessee based Christian Medical Association.
He also says some young women might not want to use emergency contraception if they knew how it worked.
A stronger dose of regular hormonal contraception, the morning after pill can prevent pregnancy by delaying a woman's ovulation or keeping sperm from fertilizing an egg.
It also can thin the uterus lining, making it difficult for a fertilized egg to implant.
That's a major reason anti abortion groups from the American Life League to the Pro Life Action League are among emergency contraception's main opponents.
While many in the medical field do not share their view, they see interfering with a fertilized egg as abortion.
"Emergency contraception is not true contraception," says Sierra Correa, the 22 year old vice president of Collegians For Life, a student group that opposes the morning after pill.
"Drug companies have been getting away with calling it contraception by redefining pregnancy to mean implantation" of a fertilized egg.
Some opponents also have argued that easier access to the morning after pill would make teens more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior though some doctors say that research done at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine casts doubt on that argument.
The study, published in the April issue of the Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology, found that teens who had emergency contraception on hand were not more likely to have unprotected sex.
It also concluded that those teens were more likely to use emergency contraception correctly and sooner after sex, when it is most effective.
Each year, there are about 3 million unintended pregnancies and in about 800000 of those cases the parents are teenagers, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control.

Over the years, I have met very few women who didn't regret their abortions.
But I haven't talked to a single woman who regretted having the child she had considered aborting.
That's why U.S. Sen Hillary Rodham Clinton's recent candor on abortion that it should be rare, but legal was welcome.
What we need now is this sort of honest discussion of the issue that reflects current realities and values.
American opinion has shifted since 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided the landmark Roe vs. Wade case.
Medical advancements that permit women to hear their baby's heartbeat at four weeks, see their fingers and toes at 10 weeks and allow babies to survive outside the womb at 24 weeks have influenced our perception of when life begins.
Like most Catholics, I oppose abortion.
But like most Americans, I don't want the government deciding the issue for a woman.
Abortion should remain legal.
Never again should women be forced to back alleys or foreign countries to terminate their pregnancies particularly if they've been raped or if pregnancy poses a life threatening risk to a mother.
We do have the power to make abortions rare, and it can be done without passing a law.
But we need better choices than those of the moralizing right, whose restrictive policies on sex education, emergency contraception (the morning after pill) and medical care for the working poor force many women to choose between an abortion and rearing a child in poverty.
Their efforts to keep young people ignorant about sex with abstinence only sex education deprives many of them of the knowledge they need to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
In the United States, 19 percent of women who get abortions are teenagers.
The liberals are no better.
Their abortion on demand policies ignore medical advancements and evolving societal values.
It has become difficult to think of a living, growing organism with a heartbeat and brain as merely a fetus whether it is a few weeks or several months old.
It's not a stretch to visualize a time in the near future when babies will be able to survive outside the womb much earlier than they do today.
At some point, the left needs to accept that most Americans have grown uncomfortable with the practice of terminating pregnancies to avoid responsibility of rearing children and with partial birth abortions that are done after the first trimester.
Texas' law that requires parents to be notified (or a review by a judge) if their minor children seek an abortion is a reasonable restriction that respects the sensibilities of most Texans.
But the State Board of Education's backward move to prevent sex education regarding condoms and other contraceptives from reaching Texas classrooms runs counter to most parents' sentiments.
It doesn't help that so many Texas children are languishing in state foster homes.
These are minority kids, mostly African American.
Mothers who can't raise their children face the heartbreaking prospect of giving their babies over to a callous system that passes them from one stranger's arms to another.
We could make real progress in reducing abortions if groups on both sides used their resources to help women overcome the conditions that make abortions so appealing.
More than 1 million abortions are preformed each year in this country.
That's a tragedy.
Outlawing abortion isn't the answer.
Legal or not, abortions will continue until women no longer have to seriously contemplate whether their babies would be better off if they were never born.
What a choice.

Peru's health minister said Monday that government plans to distribute morning after birth control pills at public health clinics will begin as scheduled in January, despite an attempt by conservative lawmakers in this predominantly Roman Catholic country to have her prosecuted for promoting abortion.
"The decision is made and there is no turning back," Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti told reporters.
"This is not based on personal beliefs, but in technical and scientific studies that show the pill is not abortive."
Mazzetti said the pill, which contains the hormone levonorgestrel and is sold in Lima pharmacies under the brand name Postinor 2, prevents pregnancy by inhibiting ovulation.
To be effective, it must be taken within 72 hours of intercourse.
Last week three conservative legislators denounced Mazzetti for "lying" when she reported to Peru's Justice Ministry that the pills are not a form of abortion because they cancel a pregnancy before the fertilized egg implants itself in the uterus.
The legislators, who argued that life begins upon fertilization, want Congress to vote on whether to lift Mazzetti's constitutional immunity to face criminal charges.
Abortion is illegal in Peru, except in cases where the mother's life is in danger.
"Any time one assumes public office there is a risk," Mazzetti said.
"Evidently, in a democratic country, everyone has the liberty to make denunciations and accusations and whatever.
If this accusation is presented, the Ministry of Health will have to back up its decisions."
Peru's Medical Board has endorsed Mazzetti, and Rocio Villanueva, Peru's deputy human rights ombudsman, said the criminal allegations against Mazzetti "have no basis."
The U.S. government is considering whether to make morning after birth control available without a prescription, and like most issues that involve sex and pregnancy, it has generated heated debate.
Fierce arguments have gone on inside and outside the Food and Drug Administration, which may decide as soon as this week whether drug stores can sell the emergency contraception known as Plan B without a prescription to women age 16 and older.
Each side accuses the other of manipulating science for political purpose.
Plan B supporters say the pill is a safe way to prevent thousands of unwanted pregnancies and the abortions that sometimes follow.
Making the contraception available over the counter, they say, is crucial for women who might need the protection over a weekend or when it is difficult to obtain a prescription.
Plan B can prevent pregnancy for up to 72 hours after sex.
The sooner the pill is taken, the more effective it is.
"Women's reproductive rights shouldn't hinge on someone else's schedule.
We should have this at our fingertips.
It should be next to condoms in drug stores," said Kelly Mangan, 22, president of the University of Florida's chapter of the National Organization for Women.
She was arrested this month in a protest outside the FDA's headquarters in suburban Maryland.
Opponents worry that the drug encourages women teenagers in particular to have risky sex.
If over the counter sales are permitted, older teenagers or adults might buy the pills for some of their younger friends or their sexual partners, critics say.
"It encourages risky sexual activity with the promise 'just pop a pill in the morning and you don't need to worry about pregnancy,'" said Wendy Wright of Concerned Women of America, a conservative group that focuses on social issues.
"What we're concerned about is a number of young people who are not engaged in sexual activity who feel tremendous pressure, and this will only add to the pressure that is on them," Wright said.
Not contested, by either side, is that the drug is drug is safe or effective.
Some who work for the FDA believed that questions about people's sexual behavior were overwhelming scientific ones, according to an internal agency memo written last year.
"Some staff have expressed the concern that this decision is based on non medical implications of teen sexual behavior, or judgments about the propriety of this activity," said the memo by the FDA's acting drug chief, Dr Steven Galson.
"These issues are beyond the scope of our drug approval process, and I have not considered them in this decision," wrote Galson, who last spring rejected the first application for Plan B's sale over the counter.
A study this month is providing evidence for both sides.
Researchers in San Francisco found that women who were given a supply of Plan B to keep at home were no more likely to have unprotected intercourse than women who had to go to a clinic or pharmacy for the contraceptive.
Women with easy access were more likely to use Plan B, leading researchers to conclude that easy access could prevent unwanted pregnancies.
But the study, which only followed women for six months, found that the two groups had about the same pregnancy rate, undercutting the argument that Plan B prevents unwanted pregnancies and abortion.
Last May, the FDA rejected nonprescription sales of emergency contraception, against the overwhelming recommendation of the agency's own scientific advisers.
The FDA said it worried that there was not enough data about the pill's use by young teenagers.
The agency promised to reconsider if the pill's manufacturer, Barr Laboratories of Pomona, New York, figured out how to sell over the counter only to those 16 and older.
In July, Barr again applied for approval.
The company now proposes that drug stores check customers' ages to be certain that buyers are at least 16, an approach the FDA has not approved before.
Younger teenagers could continue to get the drug with a doctor's prescription.
The morning after pill is a higher dose of the contraceptive hormones found in the Pill.
It prevents ovulation or fertilization, and can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting into the uterus.
Because medical experts do not consider a woman to be pregnant until after an egg implants into the uterus, the morning after pill is not considered abortion, although some conservatives object to any interference with a fertilized egg.
If a woman already is pregnant, morning after pills have no effect.
But taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, they can cut a woman's chances of pregnancy by up to 89 percent.
Pop legend Michael Jackson will spend the night in hospital after becoming violently ill on his way to his child molestation trial, his brother Randy Jackson revealed Tuesday.
Randy Jackson, who turned up at the Marian Medical Center in the California town of Santa Maria to visit his famous sibling after he was rushed to the emergency room, said Michael had been ill since the weekend.
"His spirits are fine.
We expect him to stay overnight," Randy Jackson told reporters outside the hospital emergency rooms.
"He was throwing up on the way to court today," he said.
"He's actually been sick since the weekend.
I saw him then and told him not to come to court, but he insisted on being in court Monday.
As Jackson spoke about his brother's health, one fan waiting for news of her idol broke down in tears, fell to the ground and had to be taken to the emergency room herself.
Michael Jackson is in stable condition but needs further care for "persistent viral symptoms," a doctor treating the pop star at a California hospital said Wednesday.
"Mr Jackson continues to be in stable condition and remains under observation at this time," Todd Bailey told journalists outside the Marian Medical Center in Santa Maria.
"He continues to need care for some persistent viral symptoms, but otherwise, he is in good spirits," Bailey said.
The doctor declined to comment further on Jackson's health and would not say how much longer the pop legend would remain hospitalized.
Jackson was rushed to the hospital on Tuesday after he vomited in his car as he was being driven to the Santa Maria court, where he is on trial on charges of sexually molesting a 13 year old boy.
The long awaited child molestation trial of pop superstar Michael Jackson offically got underway Monday with the judge calling the court to order, an AFP reporter witnessed.
Judge Rodney Melville took the bench at the start of jury selection, the first phase in what is expected to be a six month trial that could see the "King of Pop" jailed for 20 years in convicted.
Well ahead of schedule, a jury was selected Wednesday for the child molestation trial of pop star Michael Jackson.
"We have a jury," Superior Court Judge Rodney S. Melville announced.
The panel consists of four men and eight women, ranging in age from 20 to 79.
The racial and ethnic breakdown appeared to be: seven whites, four Hispanics and one Asian.
After the jury was sworn in, attorneys moved on to selection of eight alternate jurors.
Pop superstar Michael Jackson left hospital Wednesday, a police officer said after two black cars raced away from the medical center here where the singer was being treated.
"We have just been told that he has gone," patrolman Bob Herrick told AFP outside the Marian Medical Center in the California town of Santa Maria where Jackson had spent nearly 33 hours.
Below are the principal dates in the life of pop star Michael Jackson, 46, whose child molestation trial started Monday with jury selection.
August 29, 1958: born in Gary, Indiana August 1962: singing debut with his brothers, The Jackson Five March 1969: first Jackson Five contract with Tamla Motown, Detroit's black owned record label Michael's voice propels the group onto the hit parade with "ABC" and "I'll Be There" 1970: launch of solo career alongside that of the Jackson Five August 1980: release of "Off The Wall" album, produced by Quincy Jones, which sold 11 million copies December 1982: release of "Thriller" album, whose seven hits included "Billie Jean" and "Beat It," pushing sales to 50 million copies worldwide 1984: Jackson's face gets burnt during filming for a Pepsi ad 1985: Buys ATV Musci a company with rights to John Lennon and Paul McCartney songs for 47.5 million dollars 1985: Jackson writes "We Are The World," which benefited the fight against hunger in Africa 1987: release of "Bad," which sold 26 millions copies and marked the end of his collaboration with Quincy Jones 1988: His autobiography "Moonwalk" comes out 1990: Michael Jackson is seen for the first time wearing a surgical mask in public 1992: release of "Dangerous," which sold 22 million copies August 1993: a father accuses Jackson of molesting his 13 year old son, but settles out of court May 1994 February 1996: marriage to Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis June 1995: release of "HIStory" album November 1996 October 1999: marriage to Debbie Rowe, a 37 year old nurse with whom he has two children, Prince Michael and Paris Michael Katherine October 2001: release of "Invincible" July 2002: Jackson accuses record labels of exploiting artists, especially African Americans November 19, 2002: scandal after Jackson dangles his third son, nine month old Prince Michael II, from a Berlin hotel balcony January 31, 2003: Sotheby's auction house sues for non payment of 1.7 million dollars for two paintings February 3: in documentary "Living with Michael Jackson" broadcast on ITV, Jackson claims never to have abused a child, merely to have shared his bed February: singer's manager brings a 13 million dollar lawsuit for back salary, which was settled out of court in June November 18: police raid Jackson's Neverland ranch in California as "Number Ones" album is released November 19: warrant issued for Jackson's arrest on several counts of child molestation November 20: Jackson is arrested and handcuffed after surrendering to police, held briefly then released on bail December 18: he is formally charged with child molestation January 16, 2004: Jackson pleads not guilty during his first appearance amid a media circus January 31, 2005: Michael Jackson trial begins
Trial Judge Rodney Melville on Monday unveiled for the first time details of the charges of child molestation and conspiracy charges against pop icon Michael Jackson.
Before opening statements in the trial began, Melville read the nine page indictment that accused Jackson of sexually molsting a 13 year old boy at his Neverland Ranch between February 3 and March 3, 2003.
A British television documenatry that led to a child sex investigation against Michael Jackson "rocked" the cash strapped entertainer's world, prosecutor Tom Sneedon alleged Monday.
"The defendant Michael Jackson's world was rocked," Sneddon told the jury in opening arguments of the long awaited celebrity trial in the California town of Santa Maria.
"It wasn't rocked in the musical sense it was rocked in the real life sense," he said of the growing public and media outcry following the February 2003 broadcast of journalist Martin Bashir's documentary "Living With Michael Jackson."
"His life was rocked so badly, his close friend and confidant Marc Schaffel called it a train wreck," Sneddon said.
Sneddon alleged that for years the 1980s pop icon Jackson had been in tremendous financial debt, which led him and his aides to hatch a plot to kidnap the boy and his family and hold them against their will in order to limit the damage caused by the film.
Ailing pop star Michael Jackson is recovering from his flu, but is expected to spend at least one more day in hospital, a source close to the family said.
"He's still in hopsital," Michael Jackson fan club president and family spokeswoman Angel Howansky told AFP a day after Jackson was rushed to a hospital emergency room near the court where he is on trial for child molestation.
"I understand he will stay (in hospital) today and for a couple of days.
He's doing better he's being rehydrated.
It's definitely a flu, he's been sick for like a week, but he's better now," she said.
Jackson's parents Joe and Katherine are on their way to the Marian Medical Center in the California town of Santa Maria to see their famous son, she said.
Pop icon Michael Jackson was Tuesday rushed to hospital suffering from the flu, his trial judge said, delaying jury selection in his child sex trial.
Judge Rodney Melville said it would take "three to four days" for Jackson to recover.
"We cannot proceed without him.
That is not an option," Melville said, adjourning jury selection in the trial until next Tuesday.
An antiques and furniture store has sued pop star Michael Jackson for allegedly failing to pay a nearly US$180000 (euro138000) bill.
Kamad Enterprise, which owns Mayfair Gallery, claimed Jackson owes US$178875 (euro137340) of the US$378875 (euro290905) in merchandise he allegedly purchased in May, according to a complaint filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court.
Mayfair Gallery sells mostly 19th century European furniture.
Jackson bought 20 items, including a malachite urn, a Louis XVI style bust clock, silver bread holder and an "Austrian gold painted dancing girl," the complaint said.
An attorney for Jackson, Brian Oxman, said he had not reviewed the complaint.
"Like other proceedings involving Michael Jackson, we'll look at it carefully and deal with it in a professional manner," Oxman said.
It was the second legal action against Jackson this week alleging he failed to pay bills.
J. Marc Schaffel, a former producer and business associate, sued the singer Tuesday, claiming Jackson owes him more than US$3 million (euro2.3 million) in loans and producing fees.
Jackson is also facing child molestation charges and has pleaded not guilty.
His trial is scheduled for Jan 31.
Michael Jackson's feud with Eminem spilled on to the streets of New York on Thursday as the self styled King of Pop's fans listened to their hero slam the rapper during a protest over a music video depicting a Jackson look alike in a bed with children.
About 20 Jackson fans stood before MTV's studios in Times Square as Jackson blasted Eminem and his video.
"It's demeaning and disrespectful," Jackson told Fox News in a live telephone call heard by his fans through speakers.
He told his fans: "I love them so much."
"And I also want to make it clear that it's not just about Michael Jackson but about a pattern of disrespect that he has shown to our community," Jackson said of the white rapper.
"He needs to stop it, and he needs to stop it now."
Black Entertainment Television (BET) agreed to stop broadcasting the video, but MTV has balked at Jackson's request.
Jackson, 46, who is awaiting trial on child molestation charges, wants the rapper's "Just Lose It" video, which shows a Jackson look alike on a bed surrounded by children, taken off the air.
In the irreverent song, the always controversial Eminem says: "Come here little kiddie, on my lap.
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean rap, as in a case of child molestation."
A former business associate of US pop singer Michael Jackson has filed a lawsuit against the entertainer for breaching contract, local media reported Wednesday.
The lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Marc Schaffel, who is seeking 3 million US dollars for unpaid loans, cash advances and producing fees.
Schaffel claims that he helped Jackson make a pair of Fox television specials to rebut a controversial TV documentary that took a critical look at the singer's eccentric lifestyle.
It was that documentary, aired on ABC and British television in February 2003, that led to public fury about Jackson's dubious relationship with children and sparked calls for an investigation against Jackson.
In the documentary, Jackson appeared on camera holding hands with a 12 year old boy with whom the singer admitted sharing his bedroom.
Santa Barbara County prosecutors conducted search of Jackson's Neverland ranch in the county and charged Jackson with molesting the boy shown in the documentary after a doctor tipped the police.
Jackson, freed on a 3 million dollar bail, is scheduled to stand trial on Jan 31 on a 10 count indictment that charges him with child molestation and conspiracy to kidnap.
A son of late acting legend Marlon Brando was implicated in an alleged plot by Michael Jackson to kidnap the boy who accused him of child molestation, a court heard Friday.
The bombshell was dropped during a pre trial hearing in Jackson's child molestation case when prosecutors revealed they had recently discovered documents linking Miko Brando with the alleged crime.
Brando, 44, the son of the Oscar winning movie giant, works as a security guard for the "King of Pop" and received a 20000 dollar petty cash payment from Jackson, prosecutor Ronald Zonen told Judge Rodney Melville.
A record of the alleged December 2003 transaction was discovered in documents seized in a search of the home of Jackson's personal assistant, the court heard.
"Evidence of the movement of cash (is) consistent with count one of the indictment" against Jackson, Zonen told the court as prosecutors and Jackson's lawyers haggled over what evidence should be allowed at trial.
Count one on the 10 count criminal indictment alleges that Jackson and co conspirators planned to abduct a child, to falsely imprison someone and to extort someone.
While details of the indictment remain secret under a strict gag order in the case, the charges are thought to involve an alleged plot to abduct Jackson's young accuser, his younger brother and the boys' mother.
But Jackson lawyer Robert Sanger, arguing that the financial record should not be seen by Jackson's trial jury, said the payment proved nothing.
"There is nothing unusual with someone like Michael Jackson, with such a large operation like Neverland, to have 20000 dollars in cash delivered to them for the purpose of running their daily affairs," Sanger said.
Jackson has denied 10 counts that include allegations that he molested a 12 year old boy at Neverland Ranch in February and March of last year.
He was arrested on November 19, 2003 freed on three million dollars' bail.
California's attorney general has urged the judge in the Michael Jackson child molestation case to reject a bid by the pop star to remove the Santa Barbara County prosecutor's office from the case.
State Attorney General Bill Lockyer called the request "baseless" and said it was premised on "conjecture and unfounded speculation."
Jackson's lawyers allege that District Attorney Tom Sneddon is "blinded by his zeal to convict Michael Jackson," creating a conflict of interest that would prevent Jackson from receiving a fair trial.
Jackson has pleaded not guilty to child molestation, conspiracy and administering an intoxicating agent, alcohol.
Trial is set for Jan 31.
In a motion filed Thursday, Lockyer responded that Jackson's lawyers failed to show the district attorney's "zeal" in prosecuting the charges stemmed from anything but an "impartial consideration of the case."
As with the majority of documents in the case, Lockyer's full motion was sealed but an edited version was posted on the court's Web site.
Jackson's attorney Steve Cochran, in a motion filed Oct 8, accused Sneddon of having a vendetta against Jackson dating back to a 1993 molestation investigation that never resulted in charges being filed.
Jackson's attorneys were particularly concerned about what they decried as Sneddon's "smug" and "jocular" manner during a news conference in which he announced Jackson's arrest.
Lockyer wrote that even if Sneddon had personal animosity toward Jackson, that would not be enough to show a conflict of interest or warrant his removal.
"In sum, all of the defendant's baseless allegations are based on surmise, conjecture and unfounded speculation," Lockyer wrote.
Investigators took DNA from pop star Michael Jackson's mouth Saturday, a day after raiding his Neverland Ranch to prepare for his trial on child molestation charges, a family source said Sunday.
"The DNA swab was done on Saturday in Michael's house at the ranch," the source said.
"Attorney Tom Mesereau was with Michael when they did it."
Jackson and his three children aged 7, 6 and 2 were all at the ranch when dozens of sheriff's deputies armed with two search warrants arrived early Friday, the source said.
"Michael's children were traumatized.
They were terrified.
They cried," the source said.
Mesereau rushed from Los Angeles via helicopter to help his client and arranged for Jackson and his children to leave until the raid was over.
"The cops were there all day, until 5:15 pm.
Tom agreed to bring Michael back on Saturday to provide the DNA," the source added.
Jackson fans close to the family said the pop star and his children spent Friday in the gambling getaway of Las Vegas in neighboring Nevada state.
Jackson, 46, is charged with having molested a 12 year old cancer survivor at Neverland in February and March 2003.
He has pleaded innocent and is free on three million dollars bail.
Jury selection for his trial is due to begin in Santa Maria on January 31.
Police Friday spent eight hours combing Jackson's ranch, which lies about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Los Angeles, Chris Pappas of the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department confirmed.
He refused to comment further on the surprise search of Neverland that came as lawyers prepare to take the case to trial.
Jackson's legal team has accused prosecutor Tom Sneddon of waging a vendetta against the pop icon, despite a lack of evidence in the case.
His lawyers have complained that investigations and searches are still being carried out more than a year after Jackson was arrested and charged, delaying progress in the case.
A judge Thursday agreed to postpone the trial date for a lawsuit brought by Michael Jackson and his former lawyer over the alleged secret recording of them on a charter jet as the singer flew to be booked on child molestation charges.
Jackson and attorney Mark Geragos sued XtraJet Inc. in November, alleging they were videotaped without their knowledge on a flight to Santa Barbara so Jackson could surrender on the charges.
Superior Court Judge Soussan G. Bruguera moved the trial date from November to May 23 over the protests of XtraJet.
The trial date was postponed due to the singer's criminal case, which is scheduled for trial in January, and because Geragos is representing Scott Peterson, the murder defendant accused of killing his wife and their unborn son.
Geragos is no longer representing Jackson, but was his lawyer in November when Jackson flew from Las Vegas to surrender.
The lawsuit alleges that XtraJet "intentionally and surreptitiously videotaped and recorded" Jackson and Geragos, including the recording of "privileged attorney client communications."
XtraJet's attorney, Lloyd Kirschbaum called the lawsuit a "publicity stunt."
The videotaping surfaced when representatives of XtraJet showed the video to several news organizations, claiming they found the tapes aboard one of their jets.
They wanted to know whether it was legal to distribute or sell them.
Jackson's attorney's won a temporary restraining order against XtraJet that barred any release of the tapes.
The judge also granted Jackson's request to remove his claims of emotional distress.
The change prevents attorneys from asking Jackson any questions about his mental state, said Geragos' attorney, Brian Kabateck.
Jackson also wanted to avoid giving a deposition for the trial, but the judge denied that request, Kabateck said.
A 26 year old Canadian man has pleaded guilty to emailing a death threat to pop superstar Michael Jackson, police said Tuesday.
Adrian Poffley received a conditional discharge and 12 months probation after appearing in court Monday in Kitchener, Ontario, west of Toronto, said Waterloo police Staff Sergeant Bryan Larkin.
Police arrested Poffley in August, and charged him with uttering death threats after a joint investigation with police in Santa Barbara County, California.
They acted after a threatening email arrived at the Santa Maria Court House where Jackson was due to appear.
Jackson, 45, has pleaded not guilty to a 10 count indictment that included charges of child molestation.
The "King of Pop" was arrested last November and the scheduled start of his trial is January 31.
Police and investigators probing child molestation charges against superstar Michael Jackson on Friday launched a fresh search on his famed Neverland Ranch, detectives said.
The reason a warrant was issued for the latest search was not immediately clear.
An initial swoop on the sprawling estate in California took place just over a year ago.
The "King of Pop" was not present at the ranch, named after the home of the eternally youthful children's literary character Peter Pan, when police swooped, Jackson's entourage told AFP.
"At around 9:00 am (1700 GMT), sheriff investigators served a search warrant at Neverland Ranch ,as part of an ongoing criminal investigation," said Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department spokesman Chris Pappas said.
The raid is one of a number of searches that have been carried out on various locations linked to Jackson since he was arrested on November 20 last year.
Jackson turned himself in two days after the initial November 18, 2003 swoop on his rural estate and was later charged with having molested a 12 year old boy at Neverland in February and March of last year.
In that raid, investigators seized a large number of items to be used in evidence against him, including the top layer of a mattress that was used in the mansion.
Jackson has pleaded innocent to a 10 count indictment that accused him child abuse, plying the boy with alcohol to seduce him and with counts of conspiring to kidnap and illegally imprison the youth and his family.
Jury selection in the celebrity trial was due to begin in Santa Maria, south of Neverland, on January 31.
Jackson fans and those close to the embattled entertainer told AFP they had no idea what authorities were looking for in their renewed search of Neverland, but said the raid was a clear sign that prosecutors lack evidence against Jackson.
"I've been talking to the family," said Angel (Eds.
: one name), who heads the Friends of Michael Jackson Committee.
"They think the DA (district attorney) doesn't have enough evidence, and is trying to get more evidence," she told AFP.
Jackson and his three children left the ranch on Thursday for a trip to the Nevada gambling getaway of Las Vegas, Angel and other members of the Jackson family entourage told AFP.
"Michael wasn't there," Angel said.
"He left with the kids.
They didn't know this was going to happen today.
They are in Las Vegas now."
Jackson's legal team has accused prosecutor Tom Sneddon of waging a vendetta against the pop icon, despite a lack of evidence in the case.
His lawyers have complained that investigations and searches are still being carried out in the case more than a year after Jackson was arrested and charged, delaying progress in the case.
An attorney who has represented Michael Jackson for more than a decade has left the pop star's defense team, Jackson said.
Steve Cochran took a "temporary leave of absence" from the team defending Jackson from child molestation charges, but will continue to "collaborate" with lead attorney Thomas Mesereau Jr., Jackson said Friday.
"I would like to thank attorney Steve Cochran for all of the hard work he has done on my behalf," Jackson said in a statement released by his spokeswoman.
"He continues to be my friend and close adviser."
A reason for the departure was not released.
A message left after business hours at Cochran's Los Angeles office was not immediately returned.
In a separate statement, Mesereau denied rumors that there was animosity between him and Cochran.
He called Cochran a friend, "brilliant lawyer, and a great credit to our profession."
Mesereau declined further comment when contacted by The Associated Press.
In April, Jackson fired Mark Geragos and Benjamin Brafman, replacing the two famous attorneys with Mesereau.
The team of Cochran and Robert Sanger had worked for Jackson in lesser roles throughout the case.
Jackson has pleaded not guilty to child molestation, conspiracy and administering an intoxicating agent, alcohol.
After a seven year journey, a saucer shaped probe prepared Friday night to detach itself from the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn to dive toward one of the most mysterious bodies in the solar system: the giant moon Titan.
If successful, the Huygens probe will be the first spacecraft to visit Titan, whose dense atmosphere and apparent soup of organic chemicals have led scientists to compare it to conditions on a young Earth, just before life began.
Though astronomers have spent decades examining Titan from Earth and space, even basic facts about the moon remain unknown.
It is the only moon in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere, but scientists can only guess what kind of surface will greet Huygens a sea of liquid methane, ice, or a strange hydrocarbon.
"It is bizarre, with so much scrutiny for so much time, Titan is almost (more) mysterious now than when we started this project," said John Zarnecki, a lead investigator for the Huygens mission of The Open University in England.
"The whole thing is pretty crazy."
Huygens's suicide plunge is the most dramatic moment planned for the four years the spacecraft Cassini will spend circling the planet and its 31 known moons.
Cassini, which arrived in Saturn's orbit earlier this year, has already discovered several moons and has sent back some of the most detailed pictures of Saturn's elaborate rings.
After it detaches from Cassini, the 9 foot Huygens probe will fall toward Titan and, if all goes as planned, enter the moon's opaque atmosphere Jan 14.
The sturdy probe will have to endure temperatures of about 2700 degrees Fahrenheit from atmospheric friction during its entry.
Three parachutes will deploy, allowing the probe, which is designed primarily to study the atmosphere, to spend 2 1/2 hours measuring temperature, wind speed, pressure, and atmospheric composition, all while snapping more than 1100 pictures.
Its time in the spotlight will be short lived, however when and if it lands, Huygens will have at most only two more hours on the surface before Cassini moves out of contact and Huygens loses touch with Earth.
These are tense times for NASA and the 16 European nations involved in the $3.27 billion Cassini Huygens project, named for two 17th century astronomers.
Some scientists, such as Zarnecki, have been working on the project for more than 15 years and are unlikely to have another chance for a direct visit to such a distant body.
The mission follows a tumultuous two years at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, during which occurred the Columbia shuttle tragedy, a successful robotic landing on Mars, and, more recently, a largely failed attempt to bring back solar particles from space.
The elaborate and expensive Cassini Huygens project, launched in 1997, is a dramatic departure from NASA's recent mantra of "faster, better, cheaper," and, if successful, will probably serve as a model for more ambitious exploration projects.
Cassini's findings from Saturn itself may help scientists better understand the origin of the solar system, but it is on Titan where they hope to find more specific clues to the origin of life.
Previous observations have suggested that the moon has a hazy atmosphere of organic matter and a possibly rich top layer filled with carbon based compounds of the kind that were on Earth at the time when life is thought to have arisen.
Earth's biological and geological processes have erased the evidence from those early years, so scientists' best hope is to analyze similar conditions on another planetary body, such as Titan.
The moon's frigid temperatures estimated to be around minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit make Titan an inhospitable environment for life, but may have helped preserve concentrations of organic matter similar to those on Earth before life began.
One of the great mysteries of the Huygens visit will be what kind of landscape greets the probe.
Some scientists have speculated that organic material in Titan's atmosphere drifts to the surface and then returns to the air, much as oceans send water vapor into the Earth's atmosphere.
Zarnecki, who designed the probe's surface scientific instruments, says he hopes to find a deep sea of liquid methane and ethane.
"It could be the first time we've done oceanography somewhere else," said Zarnecki.
If there is wind, some astronomers say, Titan's relatively weak gravity could mean waves could reach hundreds of feet high, slowly moving across its surface.
Scientists have not seen any meteorite craters on the surface but suspect they could exist, buried under a lake or a gooey mixture of organic matter.
"We don't know yet," said Jonathan Lunine of the University of Arizona, a planetary scientist working on the mission.
Recent pictures of Titan taken by the Cassini orbiter seem to suggest Huygens may land on a solid surface, but scientists say they will not know until they get there.
In addition to climate history, Lunine says he wants to study "simple nonbiological chemistry" there in hopes of understanding how nonliving compounds could make the transition to life.
Zarnecki and other scientists have equipped the 700 pound stationary probe well: Huygens can measure its tilt to figure out if it lands on solid or liquid.
The probe could probably float on a methane lake and has sonar that may be able to measure depth if it lands on liquid, or even the distance to nearby rocks to measure the terrain if it lands on solid ground.
Whatever it does will have to happen quickly: If Huygens lands successfully, probably somewhere near Titan's equator, it will have no more than two hours to study the moon's surface before its only link to Earth Cassini disappears over the horizon.
By the time the orbiter comes around again weeks later, Huygens's batteries will be frozen solid.

With a gentle shove on Christmas Eve, the Cassini spacecraft will launch the European Space Agency's Huygens probe on a course that should send it plunging into the atmosphere of Saturn's big moon Titan.
The probe must be released precisely on course because it has no means of maneuvering and will remain dormant until a timer wakes it up for entry into Titan's hazy, hydrocarbon laced atmosphere and a parachute descent to the surface on Jan 14.
Confirmation of a successful release should be received by NASA's Deep Space Network antennas in Spain and Goldstone, California, just before 0400 GMT Saturday (11 p.m. EST Friday), Jet Propulsion Laboratory said.
The $3.3 billion (euro2.45 billion) Cassini Huygens mission, a project of NASA, ESA and the Italian space agency, was launched on Oct 15, 1997, from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to study Saturn, its spectacular rings and many moons.
During the nearly seven years Cassini took to reach the ringed planet, the attached probe was powered through an umbilical cable and awakened from sleep mode every six months for tests.
Cassini entered orbit around Saturn in June and has made several passes by Titan in preparation for the probe's release.
Friday evening, tension loaded springs will push Huygens away from Cassini on a free fall toward Titan.
On Monday, Cassini will perform a course change to avoid following the probe into Titan.
Huygens is designed to make a 2 1/2 hour descent by parachute to the surface of the moon, which, according to some theories, could have lakes of methane.
Instruments aboard the probe will investigate the atmosphere's chemistry and cameras will try to record images of the surface.
It's not known whether Huygens will drop into liquid or onto a hard surface, where it may operate for a few minutes.
As long as it is operating, Huygens will be transmitting data back to Cassini, which will later turn around to point its antenna at Earth and send the data to the Deep Space Network and on to ESA's Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany.

The European built space probe Huygens separated from its NASA mother probe on Friday to begin a descent to Saturn's largest moon Titan for an on site study of the atmosphere of Titan.
NASA said in an online news release that its Deep Space Network tracking stations in Madrid, Spain, and Goldstone, California, received the signal at about 10:24 p.m. EST (0324 GMT).
Titan is the only moon that has the atmosphere in the Solar system.
Its chemistry is believed to be very similar to that of the early Earth before life is formed.
And scientists hope the on site probe by Huygens would confirm the assumption and help them better understand how life appeared on the Earth.
The trip by Huygens is also expected to answer the question that whether there is any liquid on Titan's surface.
Scientists believe there are methane lakes on Titan.
The 2.7 meter wide Huygens is planned to reach Titan's upper atmosphere on Jan 14, 2005 and go through the atmosphere in two and a half hours.
Three parachutes will slow its descent so that the instruments it carries can have enough time to take detailed readings.
After reaching the surface of Titan, if it would be solid, Huygens is designed to operate for a brief period of time, possibly only 30 minutes, before its battery power runs out.
The Huygens probe, designed and built by the European Space Agency, had been carried by NASA's Saturn probe Cassini, which entered the orbit of Saturn on June 30 after a nearly seven year journey in the space.
The international Cassini spacecraft launched a probe on a three week free fall toward Saturn's mysterious moon Titan, where it will plunge into the hazy atmosphere and descend by parachute while its science instruments and cameras make observations.
The European Space Agency's Huygens probe is equipped with instruments to sample the chemistry of the planet size moon's thick atmosphere, and may reveal whether it actually has lakes or seas of liquid methane and ethane that have been theorized by scientists.
A signal confirming release of the probe was received at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at 7:24 p.m. PST (0324 GMT Saturday).
The actual event occurred earlier, but it took more than an hour for radio signals to cross the hundreds of millions of miles between Saturn and Earth.
Smiles broke out in the JPL control room where many members of the mission staff wore red and white Santa hats.
The aim had to be good because Huygens has no maneuvering system to adjust its own course, and it was designed to remain dormant until just before hitting Titan's atmosphere Jan 14.
"This was a big one partly because we had to do this right or no mission at all," said David Southwood, the ESA science program director.
"But there's still a lot to come.
We've got a hell of a long way to go."
A detailed analysis of data from the release was under way, but there were no indications of any problems, said Earl Maize, the Cassini deputy program manager at JPL.
"We are quite confident we had a very clean release," he said.
Cassini was equipped with springs to gently push the 705 pound (320 kilogram) probe away at a rate of one foot per second and impart a stabilizing spin of seven revolutions per minute.
Next week Cassini will make a course change to avoid following Huygens into Titan's atmosphere.
Huygens was designed for only a brief mission.
After entering the atmosphere it will deploy a huge parachute that will allow it to make a 2 1/2 hour descent while radioing findings back to Cassini.
After touching down at 15 mph (24 kph), it may continue sending data for up to 30 minutes, when either its battery fails or Cassini vanishes over Titan's horizon.
Cassini will later turn its antenna toward Earth and send the data back to NASA's Deep Space Network and on to an ESA operations center in Darmstadt, Germany.
Titan is a key target of Cassini's $3.3 billion (euro2.4 billion) mission to study the Saturn system, which includes its spectacular rings and numerous moons.
Scientists believe Titan may have organic meaning carbon based compounds similar those that existed on the early Earth.
Bigger than the planets Mercury and Pluto, Titan is the only moon in the solar system known to have a significant atmosphere.
Rich with nitrogen and containing about 6 percent methane, the atmosphere is 1 1/2 times thicker than Earth's.
With the Saturn system averaging about 890 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers) from the sun, Titan has a surface temperature of minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit (143 Celsius).
That surface continues to puzzle scientists despite close flybys in which Cassini's cameras have tried to peer through Titan's smog like haze.
Imaging scientists have discerned distinct dark and light colored areas, sometimes toying with such words as "islands" to describe features, but conceding they have yet to find a specific type of reflection that would indicate areas of liquid.
The Cassini mission is a joint project of NASA, ESA and the Italian space agency.
Cassini was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Oct 15, 1997, and arrived at Saturn in June.

Scientists have long thought thick clouds over Saturn's moon Titan rained methane through smoggy skies.
Some believed the liquid pooled on the planet's surface, perhaps forming lakes or seas reminiscent of Earth's.
Recent images of the moon about half the size of Earth show dark regions next to a light one.
Researchers, however, haven't been able to figure out which is higher in elevation, let alone what they're made of.
Space scientists hope to finally get some answers in three weeks when they send a space probe spinning down through the thick atmosphere of a world more distant than any visited before.
Friday holds a pivotal moment for Cassini, partly built in and partly controlled from Colorado and estimated to cost the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the European Space Agency $3.3 billion.
Launched in 1997 and expected to collect pictures and data until at least 2008, the spacecraft will fly 45 times by Titan, the only moon in the solar system with a significant atmosphere.
Many scientists suspect the moon has its own weather, as well as chemical cycles similar to those on Earth, and can even help researchers understand how life originated here.
From what scientists can tell, the chemical composition of Titan's atmosphere reflects what was on Earth several billion years ago, when life was just getting started, said Carolyn Porco, Cassini imaging leader and a researcher with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo. "(Titan) doesn't have liquid water, because it's too cold ,but chemical processes that are happening slowly there might be similar to what happened on Earth," Porco said.
"This will be like a Jules Verne adventure," she said.
"Maybe we'll see cliffs and cracks, maybe we'll see meandering streams and valleys.
Or maybe we won't."
Sometime after 8 p.m. Friday, Cassini researchers scattered around the world will watch as the landing probe Huygens separates from the spacecraft and heads toward the moon.
If separation is successful, Huygens will spend three more weeks sinking slowly toward Titan.
On Jan 14, it will float through the atmosphere on parachutes, shooting pictures for 2 1/2 hours before it hits the surface.
Larry Esposito, a University of Colorado planetary scientist, said he's "just burning with curiosity" to see what's captured by the probe's cameras, which were built by Lockheed Martin engineers in Jefferson County.
"I'm guessing it'll look a little like a bad day of skiing at Vail, when all the snow is dirty and hummocked, it's slushy and muddy, ,(and) maybe there's water underneath," Esposito said.
Huygens, which can float, is designed to hit the planet's surface at less than 20 mph, he said, and it may be able to send pictures for a half hour from the ground, a lake or whatever else it encounters.
Lockheed Martin engineer Chuck Rasbach helped design one of the Huygens cameras, which he called "rugged, robust and compact."
The camera has been tested every six months on the seven year journey to Saturn, he said, and appears to be functioning well.
Rasbach said he's proud to be part of the Cassini team, although the mission isn't likely to have practical outcomes.
"I wouldn't mind designing telephones, because it's practical, you use a telephone every day," he said.
"With space, well, ,it moves humanity forward."
The European built space probe Huygens separated from its NASA mothership late Friday to begin a descent to Saturn's largest moon Titan, during which it will sample the atmosphere of Titan.
NASA said in an online news release that its Deep Space Network tracking stations in Madrid, Spain and Goldstone, California, received the signal at about 10:24 p.m. EST (0324 GMT).
Titan is the only moon that has an atmosphere in the Solar system.
Its chemistry is believed to be very similar to that of early Earth before life formed.
And scientists hope the on site probe by Huygens would confirm the assumption and help them to better understand how life appears on Earth.
The Frisbee shaped Huygens probe successfully separated from the Cassini spacecraft Friday and began a risky 2.5 million mile journey to the surface of Saturn's bizarre, smog choked moon Titan.
Applause burst out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory shortly after 7:24 p.m. PST, when scientists received word from NASA's Deep Space Network tracking stations in Spain and Goldstone, Calif., that the Huygens probe had cast off after a seven year piggyback ride on the Cassini spacecraft.
All systems were said to have performed flawlessly in the separation.
"Today's release was another successful milestone in the Cassini Huygens odyssey," said David Southwood of the European Space Agency, which built the Huygens probe.
"Now all of our hopes and expectations are focused on getting the first (close up) data from a new world we've been dreaming of exploring for decades."
That data won't come for another three weeks, during which time the 9 foot diameter Huygens probe will chase down Titan and then, if everything goes as planned, hurl itself through the thick, nitrogen methane atmosphere before crashing into a surface that could consist of anything from a sticky chemical sludge to poison oceans.
Titan has beguiled scientists for years because it is unlike any other place in the solar system.
The only moon with an atmosphere, Titan is also of interest because it is thought to resemble the early Earth, before plant life formed and began pumping oxygen into the atmosphere.
Too frigid at minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit to grow life itself, Titan is a kind of frozen museum piece of what an early, Earth like planet might look like.
The $3.2 billion Cassini mission is a cooperative venture between NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.
The largest and most ambitious interplanetary probe ever launched, the 6 ton spacecraft lifted off Oct 15, 1997.
The mission involved 260 scientists from 17 nations.
Cassini reached Saturn in July, the first part of a two part scientific exploration.
Cassini first used its array of imaging devices to take detailed pictures as it flew through the planet's spectacular rings and swung past chilled and broken moons.
In late October, Cassini passed within 745 miles of the surface of Titan.
Though the spacecraft's cameras were able to penetrate the haze in places, the images beamed back to earth only whetted scientists' appetites for the second part of the mission, Huygens' dramatic plunge.
"Have we seen some craters?
Perhaps.
Some kind of flow on the surface?
Perhaps.
Vulcanism?
Perhaps," said Jean Pierre Lebreton, the Huygens project manager for the European Space Agency.
Answering those questions is the job of Huygens, a 700 pound collection of scientific instruments designed to sniff and measure the atmosphere of Titan as it streaks to the surface.
Although they are intrigued by images Cassini took in October of what looks to be an irregular land mass dubbed Xanadu, scientists said Friday that they had no fixed idea where the probe would land.
Titan's strong winds could blow it hundreds of miles across the surface.
Scientists are hoping the probe survives its landing long enough to send back information about the surface of the moon.
The European made space probe Huygens headed Saturday for a historic up close encounter with Titan, the only celestial body of the Solar system with an atmosphere resembling that of Earth, after successfully separating from the US spacecraft Cassini.
The mission may help prove, or disprove, a long held hypothesis that Titan may even have rain as well as lakes and rivers, albeit containing not water by unknown muddy substances.
"The probe successfully detached from the Cassini orbiter," Rosemary Sullivant, a spokeswoman for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, told AFP in a brief telephone interview.
"They received the signal, I think, at 7:24 (0324 GMT Saturday) this evening Pacific time," she said.
"All systems performed as expected, and no problems were reported."
It will take Huygens 20 days to reach Titan.
The European probe is scheduled to arrive at its destination on January 14.
At separation time, specially designed springs gently pushed Huygens away from Cassini onto a ballistic four million kilometer (about 2.5 million mile) path toward Titan, officials said.
And then, it was on its way.
"We wish to congratulate our European partners as their journey begins and wish them well on their descent to Titan," Robert Mitchell, NASA's Cassini program manager, said in a statement.
"We are very excited to see the probe off and to have accomplished this part of our job."
David Southwood, director for science at the European Space Agency, thanked his American colleagues for their assistance in the project and expressed confidence in continued fruitful cooperation between the two sides.
"Now all our hopes and expectations are focused on getting the first in situ data from a new world we've been dreaming of exploring for decades," Southwood said.
The European probe will remain dormant until the on board timer wakes it up shortly before it reaches Titan's upper atmosphere.
Then it will begin a dramatic plunge through Titan's murky atmosphere, tasting the chemical makeup and composition as it descends, with the help of parachutes, to touch down on the moon's surface.
The data gathered during this descent, which is expected to take two and a half hours, will be transmitted from the probe to the Cassini orbiter.
Cassini, in turn, is scheduled to perform Monday a deflection maneuver to keep it from following Huygens into Titan's atmosphere.
The move will also help establish the required geometry between the probe and the orbiter for radio communications during the European probe's descent.
Then the US orbiter will point its antenna to Earth and relay the data through the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration to the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany.
Huygens yet to be determined nature.
An instrumented space faring emissary called Huygens will separate Friday night from the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn and begin a three week descent of nearly 2 million miles to the planet's weird moon Titan to sample its atmosphere and its puzzling surface.
The risky mission, a joint project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency, will mark the space era's first attempt to explore any planetary moon in the solar system since the six historic Apollo landings on Earth's own satellite more than 30 years ago.
Giant Titan, 3200 miles in diameter, is the only moon in the solar system with an atmosphere all its own a dense one that has intrigued earthbound astronomers for decades.
Mission engineers have programmed the adventure to begin precisely at 7:08 PST Friday night, when three tiny pyrotechnic explosives on Cassini's exterior must sever three tiny bolts simultaneously and release three tightly compressed springs in order to propel the 705 pound, wok shaped Huygens probe away from its mother ship and send it on its long free fall through empty space to the mystery moon.
The springs are designed to give Huygens (pronounced HOY ginz) "a good spin" seven revolutions per minute and thrust it into the void, first at less than 1 mph, but then quickly to a speed relative to orbiting Cassini of about 13500 mph, according to deputy mission operations manager Earl Maize at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
"We tested and tested the system again and again long ago because releasing those springs simultaneously is critically important, and we're confident it's ready," Maize said.
"We don't think there's any chance that Huygens will miss Titan, and we've factored in everything we know of the winds that might deflect the probe on its way through Titan's atmosphere.
It looks as though it will land within a few tens of meters of its planned landing site."
If the engineers have aimed correctly, Huygens will first reach the giant moon's dense nitrogen methane atmosphere and then its surface on Jan 14 to radio back what its six instruments find there, hopefully for as long as two hours.
Just what the probe will encounter a landing site marked by hard frozen ice, lakes of liquid tar, ancient craters drowned in oozing chemical slush, or volcanoes spouting organic ices remains unknown to astronomers waiting all over the world.
At least as intriguing as the nature of the moon's surface is the precise composition of Titan's smoggy, 12 layered atmosphere, which many believe may closely resemble the mix of gases that early Earth possessed rich in the organic chemicals essential for life to emerge and evolve.
With Cassini moving on its regular programmed orbit around Saturn this week, engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory signaled the spacecraft Tuesday to perform its eighth and final "orbit deflection maneuver," altering its flight path slightly and putting it on a direct collision course for Titan.
The mission controllers also started timers on Cassini to set the precise moment at which the Huygens probe will be released from the orbiter and sent on its own ballistic trajectory with no ability to steer itself toward the planned landing site.
The location is marked by what Cassini's cameras have seen as interlocking light and dark areas, which may be plateaus next to mountain spires or low lying solids or even liquids.
"It all looks good, and we've a green light to proceed," said Jean Pierre Lebreton, the Huygens probe's chief scientist and mission manager in an interview during the recent San Francisco meeting of the American Geophysical Union.
Despite the mission's unprecedented audacity and technical complexity, the teams of scientists and engineers are confident that Huygens will reach its target and perform its tasks of analyzing the atmosphere and the surface at its landing site.
If all goes well, Cassini will signal within seconds of its programmed release sequence that the launch of Huygens has been successful.
But that message traveling at the speed of light will take one hour, seven minutes and 39 seconds to reach the eager scientists and engineers at JPL and the European Space Agency's control center in Darmstadt, Germany.
Then, as the Huygens probe falls toward the top of Titan's perceptible atmosphere, 789 miles above the surface, its two transmitters, each with its own antenna, will signal its progress to Cassini, and the orbiter will record the messages for later transmission to Earth.
After Huygens has arrived at its target, mission engineers will alter Cassini's course once again so it is no longer on its collision course toward Titan and return it to its regular orbit around Saturn and its schedule of 45 more sweeping observation flights past the intriguing moon over the next four years.
Cassini, with the Huygens probe riding piggy back, was launched from Cape Canaveral aboard a Titan 4 B rocket on Oct 15, 1997.
It flew twice past Venus, once past Earth and once past Jupiter and traveled a total of 2.2 billion miles before passing through Saturn's rings and swinging into its first orbit around the planet on July 1.
The European Space Agency built and managed the development of Huygens and directs the probe's operations.
The Italian Space Agency provided Cassini's high gain antenna, much of its radio system and crucial parts for several of Cassini's science instruments.
The probe was named after Christiaan Huygens, the 17th century Dutch mathematician and physicist who discovered Titan in 1655 and examined Saturn's rings in great detail.
The planned cost of the entire joint mission is $3.2 billion.
That includes the roughly $500 million cost of the Huygens probe, which is being borne by many of the European Space Agency's members.
The European made space probe Huygens has successfully separated from the US spacecraft Cassini and headed toward Titan, a NASA official said on Saturday.
"The probe successfully detached from the Cassini orbiter," Rosemary Sullivant, a spokeswoman for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory told AFP.
"They received the signal, I think at 7:24 (0324 GMT) this evening."
It will take Huygens 20 days to reach Titan, the only moon in the solar system which has an atmosphere.
It is scheduled to arrive at its destination on January 14.
At launch time, specially designed springs gently pushed Huygens away from Cassini onto a ballistic four million kilometer (about 2.5 million mile) path toward Titan.
The European probe will remain dormant until the on board timer wakes it up shortly before it reaches Titan's upper atmosphere, after which the probe will begin sending data back to Earth.
The European US mission to explore the Saturnian moon Titan is "a scientific success," the director general of the European Space Agency (ESA), Jean Jacques Dordain, announced here Friday.
Scientists are receiving a stream of data sent back to Earth by the US orbiter Cassini, which was relaying a transmission by the European exploratory probe Huygens, he said.
"Cassini has started delivering data," Dordain told reporters.
"We hope to have the first results tonight."
He described the mission as "a fantastic success for Europe."
Huygens plunged to the surface of Titan earlier Friday, carrying instruments to assess the moon's weather system and methane rich atmosphere during a two and a half hour parachute glide.
The European built space probe Huygens Friday emitted its first signal during its final descent toward the Saturn's largest moon Titan after a seven years' interplanetary trip, announced an official of the European Space Agency (ESA).
"The baby is alive", announced David Southwood, director of Sciences of ESA from the control center of ESA in Darmstadt, Germany.
The signal emitted by the probe was captured by the radiotelescope of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at Green Bank in Virginia, said another ESA official, Martin Ransom.
Huygens' final descent towards Titan started at 1013 GMT and is planned to land on the moon at around 1234GMT.
During the descending process, it will film Titan's surface, measure wind speed and pressure and analyze the atmosphere as it descends to the surface.
Titan was chosen for the mission since it is the only moon in the Solar System that has a substantial atmosphere.
A European spacecraft plunged through the murky atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan on Friday and successfully came to rest on a bizarre landscape never before explored.
Astronomers expressed joy at achieving the first landing on another planet's moon, particularly Titan, the only moon in the solar system to have a substantial atmosphere.
"We clearly have a success," said Dr Jean Jacques Dordain, director general of the European Space Agency.
"This is a fantastic success for Europe."
The first pictures from the spacecraft, Huygens, did nothing to undermine the reputation of Titan as a strange place.
One showed terrain of what appeared to be deep channels leading to the shoreline of a dark, flat surface, possibly a lake of liquid methane.
"Clearly there is liquid matter flowing on the surface of Titan," said Dr Martin G. Tomasko of the University of Arizona, an imaging specialist for the mission.
That possibility has tantalized scientists, who say Titan may resemble Earth early in its development and could give clues to the origin of life here.
The black and white pictures, taken as Huygens descended, were a foretaste of more highly processed color pictures that are expected to be made public on Saturday, Tomasko said.
At 5:13 p.m. local time (11:13 a.m.
ET), cheers went up here at the European Space Operations Center as the engineering and scientific data arrived, a seal of mission success.
Although the Huygens spacecraft was part of the $3.2 billion Cassini mission to Saturn in partnership with the United States, the Europeans saw it as a particularly challenging engineering endeavor that could elevate their reputation as major players in space technology.
The American built Cassini spacecraft may have delivered Huygens to the threshold of its achievement, but a spacecraft built in Europe and directed here became the first to land on the moon of another planet.
It is a feat that, as Dr David Southwood, the space agency's director of science programs, said, is "not likely to be repeated in the lifetime of anyone alive today so this is a really historic event."
And so, the Huygens team put scientific interpretation aside and enjoyed a triumph that was a long time coming.
"You can probably detect a certain relief on my face," Southwood said, and he was not alone in the control rooms at Darmstadt.
A space probe landed on the surface of a moon about 800 million miles away from Earth early Friday, extending the reach of humans deep into the solar system and giving scientists their first look at a mysterious world thought to be similar to primitive Earth.
The first black and white images from Saturn's moon Titan drew gasps from a few dozen researchers gathered in a University of Colorado auditorium to watch NASA television Friday afternoon.
In one, snapped from about 12 miles above the moon's surface, channels appeared to be cut through a light, billowy surface, separated from a darker, smoother region by a "shoreline."
In another, shot from the mysterious moon's surface, were rock like blobs, perhaps balls of frozen liquids or "ice boulders."
The moon's surface seemed less alien than many suspected, showing eroded surfaces reminiscent of box canyons, and boulders that looked like those on Mars.
"Wow.
I was not expecting to see an image that diverse," said CU planetary scientist Josh Colwell.
"Something is flowing there," he said, pointing to dark streaks cutting through lighter billows on the first image.
"The terrain looks, maybe, like it's been snowed on."
NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which spent seven years traveling to Saturn, released the European Space Agency's Huygens probe, carrying Colorado made instruments, on Christmas Eve.
Early Friday morning, the probe spun through Titan's atmosphere, slowed by parachutes that appeared to perform perfectly.
Titan is the first moon other than Earth's to be explored.
Scientists believe its atmosphere is similar to that of the young Earth, and that studying it could provide clues to how life arose here.
"I think all of us continue to be amazed as we watch our solar system unveil," NASA science administrator Alphonso Diaz said as the extraordinary images were displayed on screens at mission control in Darmstadt.
"It challenges all our preconceptions that all these planets are static places.
Seeing a planet emerge that has dynamics and complexity to it is just amazing."
Huygens was spun off from the Cassini mother ship on Dec 24 before its descent to the surface of Titan.
The $3.3 billion mission is a joint effort byamong NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian space agency.
Scientists say they received more than three hours of data from Huygens' descent, and more than 10 minutes of data from the surface itself.
At mission control in Germany, scientists shook hands and hugged each other as they confirmed data were streaming back to Earth from 800 million miles away.
NASA science administrator Alphonso Diaz held back tears.
"Incredible," he said.
Boulder researcher Carolyn Porco, also in Germany for the Huygens landing, marveled that people have now put their mark on such a distant world.
"When we look in the skies and see Saturn, now we can say we've been there," said Porco, with Boulder's Space Science Institute and the leader of the mission's imaging team.
The European built space probe Huygens has sent back the first 350 pictures of the Saturn's moon Titan, the European Space Agency (ESA) announced on Friday night.
The first picture was taken from the height of about 16 km, as Huygens descended before landing on the surface of Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn, and it showed a possibly rocky surface with "drainage channels" for liquids.
"This is absolutely a raw picture, but it has wonderful clarity, " said Marty Tomasko, an Arizona University imaging specialist, pointing to what looks like "drainage channels, canyons, also maybe a shoreline."
After an interplanetary trip of over seven years, the probe Huygens landed earlier Friday on the Titan surface.
Huygens' descent, on a moon about 1.5 billion km from the Earth, is the most distant ever attempted in the solar system.
The saucer shaped probe then registered data and transmitted them home via the mother spacecraft Cassini, marking the success of the Cassini Huygens mission worth a total of 3.2 billion US dollars.
The mission, a joint project of NASA, ESA and the Italian Space Agency, was launched on Oct 15, 1997 from Cape Canaveral, in Florida to study Saturn, its rings and moons.
Huygens was separated from its mother ship Cassini on Dec 25 after a seven year journey to begin its free fall toward Titan.
Named after Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, the probe's final descent toward Titan started at 1013 GMT on Friday.
During the descending process of two hours and a half, it began to film Titan's surface, measure wind speed and pressure and analyze the atmosphere.
Titan was chosen for the mission since it is the only moon in the Solar System that has a substantial atmosphere.
Scientists believe the organic chemical reactions taking place on Titan resemble the processes that gave rise to life on the Earth 4 billion years ago.
European space probe Huygens has landed safely on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan, an official from the European Space Agency said Friday.
Mission controllers know the Huygens probe made a soft landing by parachute because it is still transmitting steadily long after it had to have landed, David Southwood, the European Space Agency's science director, said in Darmstadt, Germany.
A European spacecraft landed safely Friday on the surface of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, scientists here said, and began transmitting data back to Earth.
Mission controllers said they were confident the Huygens craft made a soft landing by parachute because it was still transmitting signals long after its scheduled touchdown at about 1:30 p.m. (8:30 a.m. Eastern time).
"We know it has landed based on the laws of gravity," the European Space Agency's science director, David Southwood, said.
"It simply cannot still be flying.
It's got to be on a solid surface, and it must be soft."
It is the first landing of a spacecraft on the moon of another planet.
And Titan is no ordinary moon, but a body larger than the planets Mercury and Pluto, and almost the size of Mars.
The first data from Huygens came before noon Eastern time, and pictures are expected later.
Even on Titan's surface, the craft's batteries will be running low time enough for no more than 30 minutes to two hours of observations and picture taking.
On Thursday Dr Jean Pierre Lebreton, the mission manager at the European Space Operations Center here, said, "I'm quite confident we will have something special."
At a news briefing Thursday, Dr Martin G. Tomasko of the University of Arizona, a Huygens scientist, said the craft's camera and science instruments were expected to provide "a spectacularly new view of Titan and an understanding of this mysterious world."
Scientists were hoping to get their first peek inside one of the most intriguing atmospheres in the solar system.
Its dense hydrocarbon smog suggests complex chemical processes like those that led to life on Earth.
Tomasko said previous observations indicated that the atmosphere would appear green at higher altitudes and then turn orange closer to the surface.
This atmosphere has also been frustrating.
The perpetual smoggy veil has limited any view of Titan's surface to little more than a vague patchwork of light and dark regions, with only some hints of rugged topography.
The mission by the 700 pound Huygens, built and operated by the European Space Agency, is part of a $3.2 billion undertaking by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, ESA and the Italian Space Agency.
Huygens (named for the 17th century Dutch astronomer) rode piggyback on NASA's six ton Cassini spacecraft for the seven year journey to the wide ranging orbit of Saturn.
On the night of Dec 24 25, Cassini released its fellow traveler for its solo cruise on course for Titan and is now in a position to relay all the data sent from Huygens during the descent and landing.
The possibility remains that a design flaw in Cassini's radio receiver system will hopelessly scramble the data.
Engineers anticipated that signals from the wind tossed Huygens would vary widely in frequency and strength, and thus compensated for it in the receiver's design.
But they had failed to take into account frequency shifts that would also throw off the timing of the encoded data, leaving it a garbled mess.
In early 2000, an ESA engineer recognized the problem.
Finally, ESA and NASA engineers found a way to reduce the frequency shifts to acceptable levels by altering the trajectory and orientation of Cassini during the critical maneuvers.
Punching through haze and history, a European space probe landed on Saturn's major moon Friday and revealed a frigid realm of apparent rivers and lakes that seemed both familiar and fascinating to astronomers.
The first look at Titan from the European Space Agency's Huygens probe also showed icy boulders on rugged terrain and ignited celebratory glee among scientists at the Germany based control center and in other parts of the world.
"You can almost imagine yourself standing on the surface, looking out and surveying the scene," said University of Arizona planetary scientist Martin Tomasko, the chief of the probe's camera team.
"I was struck by how similar the landscape looks to what we might see on the Earth, what we have seen on Mars, what we have seen on a variety of planets."
The Huygens probe's parachute descent through Titan's thick smoggy atmosphere delivered a drama filled conclusion to a more than seven year journey that began when NASA launched the $3.4 billion Cassini mission to Saturn.
The saucer shaped spacecraft represented a $500 million contribution to the 19 nation mission from the European Space Agency, which orchestrated the landing from Darmstadt, Germany.
In a continuing search for what Titan and Earth have in common, mission experts will sift through more images for several days from a moon that is slightly smaller than Mars and 750 million miles from Earth.
Studies of the imagery and environmental readings gathered by Huygens will likely continue for years.
But just as the first images last year from the Mars rovers kept NASA scientists busy for months, Friday's first snapshots amounted to a sneak preview.
The black and white images suggested a lunar surface with bright elevated land masses, grooved by sloping drainage channels and seemingly surrounded by dark, still pools of oily liquid.
Scientists speculated that torrents of grimy methane or ethane rain shoved the boulders down to the spacecraft's equatorial landing site.
Huygens is named for the Dutch scientist who discovered Titan in 1655.
But the moon had evaded close scrutiny until the first of NASA's Voyager probes cruised by in 1980.
The flyby revealed a thick atmosphere of nitrogen that scientists believed could harbor environmental conditions similar to those on Earth before life emerged.
Cassini began orbiting Saturn in late June as part of a four year mission to study the distant planet's ring system and more than 30 moons.
A vexing petroleum haze of methane, ethane and traces of other carbon rich gases obscured the true nature of Titan even from Cassini's cameras and cloud piercing radar.
Huygens, which separated from Cassini last month, offered a 20 fold improvement in detail as it drifted nearly 2 1/2 hours before touching down.
Even on the surface, Huygens kept taking pictures until its batteries died.
"This is really, really astonishing," said Jean Pierre Lebreton, the Huygens mission chief scientist and one of the first researchers to suggest that methane and ethane would be stable as liquids even at the 300 degree below temperatures on the moon's surface.
"I just love the idea of there being liquid down there," said David Southwood, the European Space Agency's chief scientist.
"If there is liquid down there, it is going to evaporate, it's going to rain, do all those things we know and love on the Earth."
Friday's landing marked the pinnacle of achievement in space for the European Space Agency.
"Just incredible," said an emotional Al Diaz, NASA's associate administrator for space science.
"There will be only one first landing on Titan.
This was it, and the European Space Agency deserves a tremendous amount of credit."
(c) 2005, Newsday= Touchdown!
After a seven year trip through outer space, the Huygens space probe successfully completed the last leg of its epic voyage to Titan on Friday, releasing initial black and white images that brought tears to the eyes of the mission's scientists.
Taken from 10 miles above Saturn's mysterious moon, one picture shows what appear to be short drainage channels heading to a coastline, perhaps carved by liquids such as methane.
Another image, from five miles above Titan, portrays what researchers said might be flooded plains and shorelines.
A third depicts a surface strewn with blocks of frozen liquid.
Scientists said they were "astonished" by the images.
Hundreds more are expected.
"My initial reaction on seeing these pictures was 'Wow!
Look at that, it worked,' " said NASA's Robert Mitchell, program manager for the international Cassini program that delivered the probe to Titan.
The scientific feat, 25 years in the making, represents the farthest from Earth that a spacecraft has ever landed, about 890 million miles away.
Researchers believe Saturn's hazy moon may mirror conditions of an early Earth "in deep freeze," with some scientists speculating on the existence of everything from icy methane lakes and an organic compound rich smog to "continents" of rock and ice and fierce lightning and thunderstorms.
A slew of photo and sensor data sent back to Earth may now begin answering those questions.
Three weeks after detaching from NASA's Cassini spacecraft and hurtling toward the gargantuan moon, Huygens completed its journey through Titan's thick atmosphere in slightly less than 2 1/2 hours, said the agency's researchers.
In comments to the media, Mitchell said all of the probe's precious photo and sensor data had been relayed to Cassini within minutes of its landing.
Crowded into the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, scientists joined journalists in peering at banks of computer monitors throughout the day.
With confirmation that the first data had arrived from the probe via Cassini, the control room burst into cheers, with researchers hugging one another and smiling broadly.
"So we are the very first visitors of Titan and that scientific data that we are collecting now shall unveil the secrets of this new world," declared a jubilant Jean Jacques Dordain, ESA's director general, in a briefing broadcast live on NASA TV.
The Cassini Huygens mission, jointly sponsored by ESA, NASA, and the Italian Space Agency, will live on through the Cassini mothership, slated to explore Saturn's planetary system for four more years.
The first sighs of relief arrived when the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, W.Va., detected a faint signal coming from the probe during its descent.
This "carrier" signal, similar to the dial tone of a telephone, indicated the heat shield covering the back of Huygens had been ejected, the main parachute had been deployed, the batteries had switched on, and the probe had begun transmitting data.
The 705 pound probe, elated researchers said, was "alive."
His voice choked with emotion, NASA Associate Administrator of Science Alphonso Diaz saluted the "tremendous success" of the cooperative effort.
"There will only be one first successful landing on Titan and this was it," said the 20 year project veteran.
David Southwood, director of ESA's scientific program, said he doubted whether a repeat landing on Titan would occur within the lifetime of anyone at the briefing.
"So this is the data," he said.
"It's for posterity and it's for mankind."
It is also, he concluded, only the beginning.
A European robot lab parachuted to the surface of the Saturn moon Titan on Friday, successfully climaxing a venture to explore one of the most beguiling phenomena in the Solar System, mission leaders here said.
Operating in the dark and friendless chill of deep space, the unmanned probe Huygens glided to Titan's surface, relaying its findings to its American mothership Cassini, which then sent the data home to NASA's waiting radio sentinels.
Joy erupted at mission control as the precious data poured in.
Scientists and space chiefs have bet more than three billion dollars on the Cassini Huygens project and some have spent a quarter century of their lives planning it and carrying it out.
Huygens is "a scientific success ,and a fantastic success as well for international cooperation," the director general of the European Space Agency (ESA), Jean Jacques Dordain, declared.
The probe headed to Titan's surface carrying half a dozen instruments within a clam like shell to film and measure the moon's weather system and methane rich atmosphere during a two and a half hour descent.
Its sensors were designed to continue working for just three minutes after it landed on the bone freezing Titan surface.
But delighted scientists said the instruments probably continued to function for at least half an hour after touchdown, possibly providing vital clues as to whether Titan is covered by rock, methane ice or an ocean of chemicals.
"I am sure we have at least 30 minutes of surface science," said Jean Pierre Lebreton, head of the Huygens mission at ESA.
Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn, was chosen for the 3.2 billion dollar (2.46 billion euro) transatlantic venture as, intriguingly, it is the only moon in the Solar System that has a substantial atmosphere.
Its thick mix of nitrogen and methane is suspected to be undergoing chemical reactions similar to those that unfolded on Earth billions of years ago.
That process eventually provided the conditions for life on our planet.
"Titan is a time machine.
It will especially provide us with the opportunity to know about the conditions on our early Earth," Alphonso Diaz, NASA Science assistant administrator, said.
Huygen's descent, on a moon 1.5 billion kilometers (940 million miles) from home, was the farthest landing from Earth ever attempted.
The operation was fraught with potential hitches, including the risk of a crash or catastrophic malfunction when the 319 kilo (702 pound) craft entered Titan's roiling atmosphere.
Cassini had given Huygens a piggyback ride to Saturn and its moon system.
Their epic seven year trip, covering 2.1 billion kilometers (1.3 billion miles), culminated last July.
Dordain described Friday's outcome as "a fantastic success for Europe, first of all for European industry which delivered a very complex machine.
It worked beautifully with six scientific instruments, in a very harsh environment in order to break the secret of Titan."
But it was also "a fantastic success as well for international cooperation," said Dordain.
"We should learn lessons from this success.
Lessons don't come only from failure."
German Research Minister Edelgard Buhlman was equally overjoyed, hailing the mission as "one of the greatest events in space science and technology."
The chemical processes believed to be unfolding on 'Titan may give clues as to how life took root on Earth.
But life or at least life as we understand it is unlikely to exist on Titan itself, given that it is so far from Sun, receiving negligible solar heat and light.
The moon's surface temperature is estimated to be 180 Celsius ( 292 Fahrenheit).
After Friday's drama, Cassini will pursue its four year mission map Saturn, the second largest planet of the Solar System, and its leading satellites.
Huygens is named after the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, who discovered Titan in 1655.
Cassini's name comes from the Italian Jean Dominique Cassini (1625 1712), who discovered the Saturnian satellites Iapetus, Rhea, Tethys and Dione.
In 1675, he discovered what is called the "Cassini Division," the gap between Saturn's rings.
A prosecutor turned the witness chair into the hot seat for former Tyco CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski on Monday with questions about $12 million the company spent on decorations and millions more for art for Kozlowski's Manhattan apartment.
Assistant District Attorney Ann Donnelly noted for the jury that 2001 renovations on the Fifth Avenue apartment occurred at a time when Kozlowski had promised shareholders Tyco was engaged in a relentless push to save money throughout the organization.
She asked Kozlowski if the decorations including a $15000 umbrella stand and dozens of paintings were inconsistent with "a relentless push to cut costs."
"That's correct," he answered.
"It was overspent, and I take responsibility for that.
On the other hand, I thought it would appreciate in value."
Prosecutors have said furnishings at the luxurious duplex also included a $6000 gold threaded shower curtain, a $2900 set of hangers and a $2665 blue velvet pillow.
Kozlowski drew laughter from several jurors and a few raised eyebrows in Manhattan's state Supreme Court when he said he did not like some decorations.
"I stuffed some in the closet," he said.
"Some of it was God awful."
Kozlowski also defended as "appropriate" the company's $1 million expense for a weeklong celebration on the Italian island of Sardinia that was promoted as a 40th birthday party for his wife.
He said the birthday party, featuring a performance by singer Jimmy Buffett and scantily clad young men and women dancing and serving, was only one evening of a trip that rewarded some of the company's most overworked employees.
"A perk trip like this from time to time spent money on employees to keep them motivated and hopefully reward their spouses as well," he said.
The prosecutor repeatedly brought up references to Kozlowski's wife, saying her clothing was at the Manhattan apartment, where an $18 million renovation repaired light fixtures and damaged walls and floors before the decorating began.
Kozlowski said his wife spent only two nights in the apartment and he used it only as a hotel room.
"Her clothing might have been there, but she wasn't," he said.
More than $10 million, most of it Tyco money, was spent on at least a dozen paintings, including a Monet and a Renoir, for the apartment, the government said.
Kozlowski insisted he enlisted a respected art dealer to obtain a fair price for Tyco, sending her back to a London gallery to drive a $2 million price tag for some art down another $50000.
"It's just like buying a car a very, very expensive car," he said, prompting one juror to snicker.
The testimony came in the second trial of Kozlowski and former Chief Financial Officer Mark Swartz.
Kozlowski, 58, and Swartz, 44, are charged with grand larceny, falsifying business records, conspiracy and business law violations.
Their first trial ended with a mistrial in April 2004 when a juror received a menacing letter and phone call after some media reported her name during deliberations.
Kozlowski testified that his main residences were in Florida and New Hampshire and that he used the Manhattan apartment only for business meetings or when he needed to stay in Manhattan.
He said he never saw a bill for the decor, which was chosen by a woman who had renovated his property in New Hampshire and selected cushions for his yacht.
Kozlowski and Swartz are accused of stealing $170 million by hiding unauthorized bonuses and secretly forgiving loans to themselves and pocketing $430 million more by pumping up Tyco stock with lies about the state of the company's finances.
If convicted of the current top charge, first degree grand larceny, and some of the other more serious counts, the defendants each could face up to 30 years in prison.
Tyco International Ltd., which has about 250000 employees and $40 billion in annual revenue, makes electronics and medical supplies and owns the ADT home security business.
Nominally based in Bermuda, its operations headquarters are in West Windsor, New Jersey.
Prosecutors began cross examination of L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of Tyco International Ltd., seeking to show that he had no authority to dip into company coffers on his personal whims.
"Tyco was not your company, was it?" prosecutor Ann Donnelly asked the former CEO.
"Tyco belongs to the shareholders," Kozlowski answered.
"And Tyco's money was not your money to spend on yourself as you pleased, was it?"
Donnelly asked.
"That's correct," Kozlowski replied.
Kozlowski, 58, and former Chief Financial Officer Mark H. Swartz, 44, are in their second trial on grand larceny charges in Manhattan, accused of looting the conglomerate of $600 million.
Their first trial ended in a mistrial in April 2004.
Kozlowski took the witness stand Wednesday in his own defense, testifying that his intent was always to boost the company's fortunes, never to commit a crime.
He also said then that he was "not thinking" when he left a $25 million bonus off his 1999 tax return and said he never abused company loan programs.
The prosecutor attacked Kozlowski's claim that he relied on others to prepare financial documents, including his income taxes.
She cited his work history as internal auditor and chief financial officer at several Tyco units before he became CEO.
"Now, we're talking about your personal income taxes," Donnelly said to Kozlowski.
She asked whether a $25 million loan forgiveness that he says was a bonus should have been on his W 2 tax form as income for 1999.
"I absolutely agree that the $25 million belonged on my W 2," the former CEO said.
Hinting at a motive for the omission, Donnelly displayed a tax form showing Kozlowski earned $20.77 million and paid $9.66 million in taxes for 1999.
She asked how much he would have had to pay if the $25 million had been reported.
Kozlowski replied that his tax bill would have been roughly $17.5 million.
"It's your testimony that you didn't notice that $25 million was missing (from the W 2 tax form)?"
Donnelly asked.
"It is absolutely my testimony that I did not notice that it was missing," he replied.
Donnelly asked the former CEO about documents like proxy statements and annual reports that chief executives must sign.
One of the charges against Kozlowski and Swartz is that they falsified business records to hide thefts.
Kozlowski said thousands of hours by experts, lawyers and accountants went into preparing the statements and said he relied on them, but he conceded that he signed the documents and was ultimately responsible.
Kozlowski, who made more than $100 million a year in some of his years at Tyco, was asked whether he was once the country's highest paid CEO.
He replied, "I believe I read that someplace."
Kozlowski and Swartz are accused of stealing $170 million from Tyco by hiding unauthorized pay and bonuses and by abusing company loan programs and making $430 million by inflating Tyco stock by lying about the company's finances.
Kozlowski's cross examination was to continue Monday.
Tyco, which has about 250000 employees and $40 billion in annual revenue, makes electronics and medical supplies and owns the ADT home security business.

Former Tyco International Ltd. chief L. Dennis Kozlowski took the witness stand Wednesday and denied he ever abused company loan programs or received a bonus to which he was not entitled.
Testifying in his own defense at his retrial on larceny charges he did not take the stand at the first trial Kozlowski said his intent was always to grow the company, never to commit a crime.
Still, asked by his lead lawyer why a $25 million (euro19 million) bonus from the company did not appear on his 1999 tax return, Kozlowski said he could not explain why.
"I just was not thinking when I signed my tax return that I had a $25 million loan forgiveness," Kozlowski said.
"Year in and year out at Tyco, my tax returns for the most part had been correct.
I didn't pick up on it."
The $25 million forgiveness of loans from the company had come as part of $62 million (euro48 million) in bonuses Kozlowski received at the time.
Prosecutors say it should have been reported as income.
Tyco, which has about 250000 employees and $36 billion (euro27.8 billion) in annual revenue, makes electronics and medical supplies and owns the ADT home security business.
Nominally based in Bermuda, its operations headquarters are in West Windsor, New Jersey.
Kozlowski, 58, was the first defense witness in the trial of him and former Chief Financial Officer Mark H. Swartz, 44.
The two are accused of looting the conglomerate of $600 million (euro460 million).
They are accused of stealing $170 million (euro131.5 million) from Tyco by hiding unauthorized pay and bonuses and by abusing company loan programs and making $430 million (euro332.8 million) by inflating the value of Tyco stock by lying about the company's finances.
The defendants are being retried in Manhattan's state Supreme Court on charges of grand larceny, falsifying business records and violating state business laws.
Their first trial ended in a mistrial in April 2004 after a juror received menacing messages during deliberations as a result of her name being published.
The press customarily does not name jurors during a trial.
Kozlowski, whose appearance as a witness was something of a surprise, began by answering a series of questions posed by his lawyer, Stephen Kaufman.
Had he ever taken a bonus to which he was not entitled?
Did he abuse Tyco's loan and relocation programs?
Kozlowski replied "no" to each question.
Kozlowski later testified that he thought a $20 million (euro15.5 million) fee he paid Tyco board member Frank Walsh for arranging the acquisition of commercial lender CIT Inc. had been proper.
When another board member suggested Walsh should give the fee back because of enhanced corporate scrutiny following the fall of Enron Corp., Kozlowski said he defended the deal.
"I said if they thought I did something wrong I was willing to step down as CEO of Tyco," Kozlowski said.
He said none of the directors objected.
Walsh later quit the Tyco board rather than give the fee back.
Kaufman asked Kozlowski: "Did you believe the payment of the fee to Frank Walsh required the authorization of the board of directors?"
"No, I did not," Kozlowski replied.
"Did you intend to steal the money?" the lawyer asked.
"Absolutely not," Kozlowski said.
Swartz was the only defense witness in the first trial.
On the witness stand for nine days, he explained in detail Tyco's compensation plans, his and Kozlowski's relations with the board of directors and actions that prosecutors said were illegal.
On Tuesday, after the prosecution rested, defense lawyers suggested that Kozlowski could testify, but they insisted no decision had been made.
During his first two days on the witness stand, L. Dennis Kozlowski appeared calm as he parried a series of tough questions.
On Monday, things turned decidedly more contentious as he faced accusations that he misused company funds for lavish living and lied about it on the stand.
Kozlowski, former chief executive of Tyco International, and Mark H. Swartz, his former chief financial officer, are facing charges that they looted the company of $150 million by secretly forgiving millions of dollars of loans to themselves and others, without board approval.
He has contended that the board approved bonuses that were used to forgive the loans.
In a fiery exchange at the end of the day, Kozlowski's key testimony that he had received verbal approval for millions of dollars of bonuses from the head of the compensation committee, Philip Hampton, who has since died from cancer was challenged during a heated cross examination.
"It is true, it is a fact you never had any conversation with Phil Hampton about you and your co defendant getting 37 and a half million dollars in 1999, did you?"
Ann Donnelly, an assistant district attorney, asked derisively.
"I had conversations with Phil Hampton in 1999, in 2000, yes.
I did," Kozlowski responded, clearly agitated.
"You never had any conversation with Phil Hampton in which he knew you and your co defendant were taking $24 million, did you?"
Donnelly continued.
"That is totally untrue," Kozlowski answered.
The cross examination in the trial level state Supreme Court in Manhattan, which ended Monday redirect examination begins Tuesday often put Kozlowski on the defensive.
While he frequently appeared composed, there were points in his testimony at which he challenged Donnelly.
At other times, he appeared unable to answer certain questions, responding by saying, "I can't recall" or "I don't remember."
Donnelly spent much of the afternoon asking about Kozlowski's prolific spending of the company's money.
She asked him whether using $1 million of Tyco's money on an elaborate trip in Sardinia, Italy, at which a birthday party was held for Kozlowski's wife, was consistent with a statement in the company's annual report that called for "a relentless push to cut costs."
Kozlowski responded: "There was a relentless effort to cut costs, but we also spent some money on employees to keep them motivated and to hopefully reward them, especially their spouses who gave up an awful lot of time with Tyco employees."
Donnelley zeroed in on an $18 million apartment on Fifth Avenue that Kozlowski had the company buy, and an additional $12 million of company money that was used to renovate and decorate the apartment.
Kozlowski, who said a decorator he hired had "overspent," acknowledged: "I did not oversee this in the manner in which I should have overseen that apartment.
I was doing other things and I should have been focused on the amount of money being spent there.
I take responsibility for that."
Calling some of the decorations "god awful" and telling jurors that "I stuffed some of it in the closet,"' he added: "I also felt that the asset was going to improve appreciate for Tyco and I was given assurances by the decorator that the antiques and things that she put into that apartment were of ultimate value and should appreciate in value.
And those items belong to Tyco."
He said he rarely used the apartment and treated it like a hotel: "I used the apartment for business meetings and to sleep there when I was in town on Tyco business."
Calling the apartment "a Tyco facility," and saying his wife slept there only two times ("Her clothing might have been there, but she wasn't," he said).
He insisted he did not consider it a home, describing home as "a place where you live, where you may have your family dog."
He kept homes in Boca Raton, Fla., and Nantucket, Mass., he said.
Kozlowski also defended using more than $10 million of Tyco money on expensive artwork, including a Monet and a Renoir, saying that they were assets of the company and that he thought he had negotiated a good deal to buy them.
Describing how an agent went back and forth with a London art dealer to negotiate a deal for one of the paintings, he said, "It's just like buying a car a very, very expensive car."
Donnelly, trying to mock him, questioned his motives for later wanting to sell the art, challenging an answer he gave in which he said he felt he could not move the art to his house in Boca Raton because his wife had security concerns.
"Didn't Tyco own ADT?"
Donnelly shot back, referring to the security alarm company.
"We had a security system," Kozlowski said.
"People know how to get around those from time to time."
A retired chairman of the board of Tyco International Ltd. testified the company's financial monitors never told him about millions of dollars in forgiven loans and bonuses for Tyco's two top executives.
Lawyers for L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's former CEO, and Mark H. Swartz, the company's former finance chief, suggested that former chairman John F. Fort and other directors knew about but did not protest money the executives received.
Fort, 63, was chairman of the board's audit committee for much of Kozlowski's time as CEO.
He said Mark Foley, Tyco's director of financial operations, never told him Kozlowski and Swartz had a total of $37.5 million in loans from Tyco in 1999.
Fort, under redirect questioning by prosecutor Ann Donnelly, also said the head of Tyco's external audit team, Richard Scalzo of the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, never told him anything about Tyco's finances being amiss.
Fort said he asked Scalzo in each audit committee meeting whether he had seen anything that might hurt or embarrass the company or that the board needed to worry about, and Scalzo always answered that nothing was wrong.
"In each meeting he assured us of that," Fort testified.
Fort was the first witness in the retrial of Kozlowski and Swartz, and testified for three full days.
Kozlowski, 58, and Swartz, 44, are on trial in Manhattan's state Supreme Court on charges of grand larceny, securities fraud, falsifying business records and related counts.
If convicted of grand larceny alone, each could face up to 25 years in prison.
Prosecutors say Kozlowski and Swartz stole $150 million outright by improperly forgiving company loans to themselves, awarding themselves unauthorized bonuses and having Tyco pay for their personal expenses.
Prosecutors say the defendants also made undetermined illegal profits by selling $575 million worth of Tyco stock whose value they had artificially inflated.
When the trial continues Thursday, the next witness is expected to be Frank Walsh, a former Tyco director whose receipt of a $20 million investment banking "fee" marked the beginning of the end of Kozlowski's tenure.
Walsh was indicted in connection with the payment but pleaded guilty and escaped prison in part by returning the money.
Tyco International Ltd., which has more than 250000 employees and $36 billion in annual revenue, makes a wide range of products including electronics, medical supplies and security devices.
It is nominally based in Bermuda but has its operations headquarters in West Windsor, New Jersey.
Former Tyco International Ltd. CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski finished four days of testimony at his grand larceny trial, insisting that he left it to lawyers and accountants to decide what to tell shareholders about his compensation.
Testifying only briefly Tuesday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan in response to followup questions from his lawyer, Kozlowski acknowledged that as CEO he signed the company's most important documents relating to what was publicly reported about his finances.
He said he trusted the decisions of the lawyers and accountants and did not direct them on whether to include information on public documents such as tens of millions of dollars in loans that were forgiven as part of his annual bonus packages.
Kozlowski also testified that he did not notice that $25 million in bonus payments used to pay off a company loan was not included on his tax forms from the company for 1999.
"No one ever told me it wasn't on my W2," he said, referring to the tax document that lists how much he was compensated for the year by the company.
"It never dawned on me."
He also said he paid about $1 million of his own money toward the company's weeklong celebration on the Italian island of Sardinia that was promoted as a 40th birthday party for his wife.
The company also paid about $1 million.
Since taking the stand April 27, Kozlowski testified extensively about the party and the tens of millions of dollars the company spent on a Fifth Avenue apartment he said he used only sparingly.
On Wednesday, Kozlowski's co defendant, former Chief Financial Officer Mark Swartz, was to begin testifying.
Kozlowski, 58, and Swartz, 44, are charged with grand larceny, falsifying business records, conspiracy and business law violations.
Their first trial ended with a mistrial in April 2004 when a juror received a menacing letter and phone call after some media reported her name during deliberations.
They are accused of stealing $170 million from the company by hiding unauthorized bonuses and secretly forgiving loans to themselves and pocketing $430 million more by pumping up Tyco stock with lies about the company's finances.
If convicted of the top charge against them, first degree grand larceny, and some of the other more serious counts, the defendants each could face up to 30 years in prison.
In their first trial, Swartz was the only defense witness.
On the witness stand for nine days, he explained Tyco's compensation plans, his and Kozlowski's relations with the board of directors and actions that prosecutors said were illegal.
Tyco International Ltd., which has about 250000 employees and $40 billion in annual revenue, makes electronics and medical supplies and owns the ADT home security business.
Nominally based in Bermuda, its operations headquarters are in West Windsor, New Jersey.
L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of the conglomerate Tyco International, took the stand to declare his innocence at his retrial Wednesday, a surprising reversal in strategy from his first trial, at which he did not testify.
As word spread early Wednesday at the New York State Supreme Court in Lower Manhattan that Kozlowski was about to testify, the often near empty courtroom quickly filled with spectators.
Looking directly at the six men and six women of the jury, Kozlowski, whose first trial ended in a hung jury, explained why he had decided to take the stand.
"I'm here so I can explain to them why I'm innocent of all the charges against me," he said, dressed in a gray suit, light blue shirt and navy tie.
In long and sometimes rambling answers to his lawyer's questions, Kozlowski portrayed himself as an earnest, often harried, executive who rose through the ranks and had the full support of the company's board.
While his testimony was clearly prepared and perhaps unsurprising, Kozlowski will face his most important test as early as Thursday, when the prosecution is expected to begin its cross examination of him.
He is likely to be challenged in particular over his explanation on Wednesday on why his 1999 tax return omitted a $25 million payment that was used to forgive a loan from Tyco.
He matter of factly said the omission was a mistake.
Kozlowski's decision to testify a choice that is fraught with risk gave members of the jury their first chance to hear directly from the man whom they have sat across from for nearly four months.
Speaking in his trademark squeaky, nasal voice, which seems at odds with his physically imposing appearance, Kozlowski and his lawyers may be hoping that putting him on the stand will humanize him and allow him to directly answer the charges against him.
"Once a defendant decides to testify, in many senses everything that came before it in the trial becomes irrelevant," said Jonathan Polkes, a partner at Weil Gotshal & Manges and a former federal prosecutor.
"If the jury likes and believes the defendant, the jury will be inclined to acquit.
If they don't, they'll be inclined to convict."
Kozlowksi and Tyco's former chief financial officer, Mark H. Swartz, are accused of stealing $150 million by improperly forgiving company loans to themselves and awarding themselves unauthorized bonuses.
They are also accused of profiting illegally by selling $575 million worth of Tyco stock whose value they had artificially inflated.
In choosing to put Kozlowski on the stand, his lawyers may have been encouraged by interviews with jurors after the first trial, who had commented that their impression of Kozlowski had changed for the better after they viewed a snippet of him speaking on a videotape of the now infamous $2 million birthday party for his wife in Sardinia that was partially paid for with Tyco funds.
The jurors said they were fascinated by how out of place Kozlowski seemed at the party and his unpretentious demeanor.
The most famous of those jurors, Ruth Jordan, Juror No. 4, who had held out for an acquittal, made a much noticed appearance in court on Wednesday, taking a seat in the back row after lunch.
She drew more attention by the throng of camera crews that assembled outside of the courthouse than even Kozlowski.
Kozlowski may have also felt he needed to testify because the prosecution, so far, has appeared to put on a substantially stronger, more focused case this time around.
During the first trial, jurors said they were put off by the prosecution's often meandering and disorganized presentation that focused as much attention on his lavish spending as it did on the criminal charges.
Kozlowski's lawyer, Stephen Kaufman, spent much of the morning having him recite his rags to riches story.
Kozlowski, 58, told the jury how he grew up in Newark, N.J., played guitar in a band to make money in high school (he said he was a horrible guitar player but was good at booking gigs), went to Seton Hall University, was married to a woman from the Bronx and was paid $28000 a year when he started at Tyco as an accountant in the early 1970s.
He then outlined his credentials, testifying that revenue at Tyco was about $20 million when he arrived and had grown to $40 billion by the time he left the huge conglomerate in June 2002.
Kozlowski also explained a crucial part of the defense's case that Tyco's compensation committee, and specifically its leader Phillip V. Hampton had approved the bonuses in question.
Hampton died of cancer in 2001.
Several of Tyco's directors on the compensation committee have testified that the bonuses were not approved.
Kozlowski described Hampton as a mentor and the man who had helped him become chief executive.
"He covered my back at the organization," Kozlowski said.
He recounted several conversations in which he insisted that Hampton had given him explicit permission to forgive the loans in question.
At one point, he recalled a conversation with Hampton in which Kozlowski told him that the year's bonuses were going to be huge and he suggested that instead of paying them in full, the bonuses be partially used to pay off loans.
"The numbers are going to be big, embarrassingly big," he said he told Hampton, whom Kozlowski said signed off on the plan.
Hoping to take the heat out of perhaps the prosecution's strongest piece of evidence that a $25 million payment was absent from his 1999 tax return, Kozlowski just apologized.
"I cannot explain why," he said.
"I was not thinking when I signed my tax return."
He said he never noticed the money because it was forgiveness of a company loan and he never received a check for it.
Seeming almost embarrassed, he said that it was part of a pay package that year that amounted to more than $60 million, much of which he had deferred for tax purposes.
Furthermore, he insisted, his accountant and an administrator missed the omission as well.
He portrayed himself in his testimony as a busy executive with a punishing schedule and endless commitments that often put him on the road and consumed his attention, forcing him to delegate the details to others.
He added that he trusted the company's day to day operations to others and preferred to delegate rather than delve into details.
Asked if he had a computer in his office, he replied, "Yes, but just for show."
L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of Tyco International, parried a barrage of tough questions during cross examination on Thursday, at times appearing to frustrate an increasingly incensed prosecutor by calmly and consistently agreeing with her.
"Tyco's money was not your money to spend on yourself as you pleased, was it?" the prosecutor, Ann Donnelly, asked Kozlowski, clearly trying to agitate him.
"That's correct," Kozlowski nonchalantly replied.
"Where did the buck stop?" she continued.
"The buck stops with me with everything at Tyco," he said in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Sitting calmly on the witness stand for nearly four hours, Kozlowski, who is accused, along with the company's chief financial officer, of looting the company of $150 million by secretly forgiving loans they had received, acknowledged that mistakes had been made in disclosing some payments in government and tax filings.
But he said they were innocent mistakes and the payments were properly authorized bonuses.
While Kozlowski admitted many of the prosecution's assertions about how the money was used, he consistently said that he never intended to commit a crime because all the loans, which he says were approved by the board, were "in the records and books of the company," as he explained at one point.
During the last portion of his direct testimony, he said that he had typically tried to pay off his loans at the end of every year.
He also said that when he left Tyco in June 2002, he owed the company about $16 million in outstanding loans, but the company held about $80 million in compensation he had deferred.
Still, his most difficult testimony came when he was confronted with his W 2 form from 1999, which omitted $25 million that Tyco had forgiven him.
Again, Kozlowski agreed with Donnelly.
"I absolutely agree that the $25 million belonged on my W 2 that was prepared by Tyco," he said.
"The numbers were big, I had a lot of money in deferred income," he said as in way of explanation.
He said he also earned about $38 million, which he deferred, and as a result, it was not taxed.
Donnelly, seeming almost exasperated, pressed him further.
"It's your testimony that you did not notice that $25 million was missing?" she asked.
"That is absolutely my testimony," he said.
Kozlowski later told jurors that his tax bill for that year was $9.6 million.
Had the $25 million been included, he said, he would have owed the government about $17.5 million.
Kozlowski is not charged in this trial with evading the tax, but prosecutors hope to use the W 2 form as evidence that he tried to conceal that payment.
Donnelly also displayed minutes from a 1999 Tyco compensation committee meeting where Kozlowski's pay was approved.
"There is no section in these minutes that gives you $25 million in loan forgiveness, is there?" she asked.
"No," he said.
He later said she misused the term "loan forgiveness."
"Ms Donnelly, I was given a bonus, and instead of taking the cash bonus, I was paying down debt to the company," he said.
Donnelly spent much of the afternoon questioning Kozlowski about his use of two of Tyco's loan programs, which he is accused of misusing.
Kozlowski used the two programs, one to help employees pay relocation costs and another to help them pay taxes on restricted stock grants, to pay for an assortment of items that fell outside of those purposes.
He did not deny that the loans were used for purposes other than the ones described.
"I thought I was authorized," he said.
The program had been used for other purposes by other executives since the 1970s, he said, "long before I was CEO of the company, well before I was an officer."
Kozlowski also said that the decision to use the loan program instead of his own money for certain payments was typically made not by him, but by an assistant at the company who was in charge of his personal finances.
"So you are saying that it was the responsibility of Cathy McRae, who ran your personal affairs, to decide whether or not she should use Tyco money for your personal investment?"
Donnelly asked.
"The responsibility of my personal affairs were mine," he said.
"She had the authority to manage my personal affairs and make decisions within that sphere of responsibility."
He added: "Cathy did make some decisions whether she would pull from the Key Employee Loan that I was entitled to, or whether she would write a check from one of my banks."
At one point, Kozlowski came under fire after acknowledging that he had said he did not know the $25 million he received was used to pay down an employee loan, instead of his relocation account balance.
"Ms Donnelly, it may seem inconceivable to you that I may not know how that happened," he said.
"I am responsible for what I owe Tyco.
I take full responsibility for that.
But to sit down and to track the loans on a day in and day out basis, to reconcile loans, to make wire transfers, to take care of the things that I was doing, that responsibility I delegated to somebody else, simply because I was the chief executive officer of Tyco and, you know, I was doing many, many other things at that time."
Kozlowski was also shown proxy materials and annual reports from certain years that described the loan programs in explicit terms, unlike those from several other years in which the terms were slightly vaguer.
Donnelly asked Kozlowski, who is also accused of securities fraud, whether it was his responsibility to make sure the proxy was accurate when he signed it.
"I'm not skirting my signing responsibility, but in my becoming chief executive officer of Tyco, I relied upon the experts in the field of proxy preparation and SEC law to appropriately represent that which needed to be disclosed for Tyco and that which did not need to be disclosed for Tyco," he said.
"Still, I'm ultimately responsible."
A $2 million (euro1.5 million) birthday party, a key component in the prosecution's case in the first trial of Tyco International Ltd.'s former top executives, was raised for the first time Tuesday in their retrial.
In his third day of questioning by prosecutors, Mark D. Foley, Tyco's former senior vice president of finance, testified that he was told the 2001 party was a "management meeting" on the island of Sardinia off the coast of Italy and would include a meeting of Tyco's board of directors.
Foley said he later learned the meeting would include a number of nonmanagement personnel.
"I think it worked out close to 50 50," Foley said in response to a question by Assistant District Attorney Marc Scholl.
Prosecutors claim the weeklong event was more of a celebration for Chief Executive L. Dennis Kozlowski's wife, Karen Mayo, rather than a company function.
The event was attended by about 75 people, including Chief Financial Officer Mark H. Swartz.
Kozlowski, 58 years old, and Swartz, 44, are on trial in New York State Supreme Court, facing charges of grand larceny, securities fraud and other crimes in connection with giant bonuses and other compensation they received while working as Tyco's top executives.
They each face up to 25 years in prison on the most serious charge of grand larceny.
They have denied wrongdoing.
Their first trial ended in a mistrial in April after a juror reported receiving a phone call and letter about the case during deliberations.
The juror's name had been disclosed by several news organizations after she appeared to give an "OK" signal to the defense.
In the first trial, Barbara Jacques, a former Tyco employee who helped plan the event, testified that about half the party was paid for by Tyco and the rest was paid by Kozlowski.
During her testimony, prosecutors played a videotape of the party, which included an elaborate ice sculpture of Michelangelo's David, models in Roman dress and a performance by pop musician Jimmy Buffett.
As cross examination by defense attorneys began Tuesday, Foley testified that he wasn't instructed to withhold documents from Tyco's auditors, its audit committee or the company's directors.
"Did Dennis Kozlowski ever tell you to withhold any records from the outside auditors?" asked James R. DeVita, one of Kozlowski's lawyers.
"No," Foley said.
Tyco International Ltd.'s former head of finance testified Thursday he never saw that millions of dollars in special bonuses for former top executives L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz were ever approved by the company's compensation committee.
Under questioning by prosecutors, Mark D. Foley, the Bermuda conglomerate's former senior vice president of finance, also said he wasn't aware of any documents being provided to the committee that detailed the special bonuses paid to Kozlowski, Tyco's former chief executive, and Swartz, its ex chief financial officer, in those years.
"Did you know of any document provided to the compensation committee that stated Dennis Kozlowski got $32 million in loan forgiveness and gross ups in September 2000?" asked Assistant District Attorney Marc Scholl.
"No," Foley said.
Prosecutors claim Kozlowski and Swartz took millions of dollars of compensation without proper authorization by Tyco's directors, including more than $32 million (euro24.13 million) in loan forgiveness and payments to cover taxes, known as gross ups, to Kozlowski in 2000.
Kozlowski, 58 years old, and Swartz, 44, are on trial in New York State Supreme Court, facing charges of grand larceny, securities fraud and other crimes in connection with giant bonuses and other compensation they received while working as Tyco's top executives.
They each face up to 25 years in prison on the most serious charge of grand larceny.
They have denied wrongdoing.
Their first trial ended in a mistrial in April after a juror reported receiving a phone call and letter about the case during deliberations.
The juror's name had been disclosed by several news organizations after she appeared to give an "OK" signal to the defense.
In his fifth and final day of testimony, Foley said management representation letters provided to Tyco's auditors and its directors indicated millions of dollars in management bonuses were paid to key employees in 1999 and in 2000, but didn't specifically state bonuses were paid to Kozlowski and Swartz.
More detailed documentation of the bonuses were provided separately to the auditors, Foley said.
"Was Dennis Kozlowski a key Tyco employee?" asked James R. DeVita, one of Kozlowski's lawyers.
"Yes," Foley said.
Brian Moroze, Tyco's deputy general counsel, testified Thursday that Swartz ordered him to change a company relocation program in 1995 to allow certain employees to borrow money for more than one home.
Moroze said Swartz, in a handwritten memo, also told him to change the program to extend the period in which employees could receive temporary housing assistance from 12 months to 24 months and to add language that allowed the employees to receive educational expenses for their children.
The program was in connection with the relocation of certain employees to New York, including Kozlowski and Swartz.
Before that, Tyco had only provided "bridge" loans for relocation, meaning employees could borrow against the equity in their homes to buy a new home near their new work location.
The employee would repay the bridge loan when they sold their old home, he said.
However, Moroze said he didn't have personal knowledge if the company's compensation committee ever approved the changes.
Tyco has its headquarters in Bermuda, but now operates out of New Jersey.
Prosecutors have been chasing corporate crooks and piling up big statistics in court for five years.
Now get ready for a series of trials featuring many of the biggest executives charged with the most audacious crimes of their era.
A few big figures, like Martha Stewart and Frank Quattrone, were mixed into the mostly no name court lineup last year.
But 2005 will be remembered as the year of the marquee CEO on trial.
Take a look at this lineup: Bernie Ebbers.
The trial of the former WorldCom Inc. chief executive charged as the front man for an $11 billion fraud begins this week in New York.
Ebbers is charged with fraud and conspiracy in the WorldCom collapse, the largest bankruptcy in US history.
Former chief financial officer Scott Sullivan, who cut his own plea deal, will be the government's star witness.
This will be an important test of the "idiot CEO" defense (see Richard Scrushy and Ken Lay, below).
Ebbers is expected to say he left all the numbers to Sullivan, who told prosecutors what they wanted to hear when he got in trouble.
Ebbers was a big picture guy.
L. Dennis Kozlowski, the sequel.
The former Tyco International Ltd. chief who became a symbol of material excess began his retrial in New York Tuesday.
The first trial of Kozlowski and Tyco chief financial officer Mark Swartz ended in a sensational mistrial after a juror favoring acquittal found herself in the middle of a media frenzy and ultimately received a threatening note.
Kozlowski and Swartz are charged with stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from Tyco by hiding details of their compensation from directors and selling big blocks of company stock after inflating its value.
But it was Kozlowski's outrageous spending on the company tab ($15000 for an umbrella stand?) that got most of the headlines.
Richard Scrushy.
The founder of HealthSouth Corp. is charged as the mastermind behind a $2.7 billion earnings fraud in a trial underway in Alabama.
A jury is being selected.
The HealthSouth scam wasn't as big as the WorldCom fraud, and the company continues to operate today.
But Scrushy takes the cake when it comes to defense stories.
He wasn't just the idiot CEO, he may have been in a coma.
Prosecutors will rely on five former chief financial officers who will all implicate Scrushy as the ringleader.
One secretly recorded the former chief executive for the government.
Scrushy will blame his lieutenants for inflating HealthSouth's profits.
See a pattern?
Ken Lay.
The former Enron Corp. chairman faces two trials.
One, in which Lay faces fraud, conspiracy, and bank fraud charges alone, will probably be held later this year.
The other, in which he is charged along with two other former Enron executives, may not make it to court before spring 2006.
Former chief executive Jeff Skilling and ex chief accounting officer Richard Causey will join Lay at a second fraud trial.
The Enron team was on the job during the most infamous corporate fraud of its time.
More than 5000 employees lost their jobs when Enron filed for bankruptcy in 2001.
Lay, as you surely know by now, was just another big picture guy in the dark about his company.
The idiot CEO strategy may sound risky, but it has been successful elsewhere.
A jury in Hartford was unable to reach a verdict against former Cendant Corp. chairman Walter Forbes two weeks ago, despite incriminating testimony from three executives.
The trials ahead culminate the effort to hold people criminally responsible for the worst excesses of a dangerously excessive time.
But don't count the idiots out yet.

NEW YORK Defense lawyers took a decidedly new approach in their opening arguments in the retrial of L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz in state Supreme Court on Thursday, lashing out at the former directors of Tyco and attacking their credibility.
Prosecutors are saying the two men had illegally awarded themselves millions of dollars in bonuses and concealed them from the company's board and shareholders.
Lawyers for both defendants, who had appeared to soft peddle that issue in the first trial, told the jury that the directors' accusations that the two men stole more than $150 million the entire basis of the prosecution's case is part of a self serving strategy by directors to protect themselves from shareholder lawsuits.
"The directors are concerned about their pocketbook," Kozlowski's lawyer, Stephen Kaufman, said, calling their contention that they had never approved millions of dollars of bonuses for the men "revisionist history."
Raising his voice, Kaufman added: "If Dennis can be blamed, that helps them."
Swartz's lawyer, Charles Stillman, applied the same theme, telling jurors, "You need to decide who is telling you the truth."
But in a revealing moment, Stillman also appeared to divulge a strategy shift, one that could ultimately pit Swartz against Kozlowski.
At the end of his presentation, Stillman told the jury, "You must consider the evidence for each man separately."
That statement is a departure from the strategy that defense teams used in the first trial in which both appeared to approach the case with an all for one and one for all policy.
Indeed, throughout Stillman's presentation Thursday, he constantly referred to Swartz individually and rarely mentioned Kozlowski's unless he was making the case that Swartz was his subordinate.
Before the first trial and the retrial, Swartz had sought to separate the cases, but the judge refused the requests.
Still, Stillman's remarks were the first time he seemed to try to distance Swartz from Kozlowski, despite the fact that both men are charged with nearly all the same crimes.
The shift may be the result of interviews with jurors from the first trial, who said that they liked Swartz, who testified in the first trial, better than they liked Kozlowski, who did not testify.
One issue that both defense teams did agree on was to make the issue of criminal intent a part of their presentations.
In the first trial, which ended in a mistrial, at least one juror said she was planning to acquit the men because she could not find that the defendants had criminal intent.
Kozlowski's lawyer, Kaufman, spoke in front of a projection screen that said "Good Faith Belief Equals No Criminal Intent."
"The facts are that every penny that my client earned was on the books and records of the company he headed," he said.
"Dennis never committed any act of concealment."
"Criminals act in criminal ways," Kaufman said.
"Does this strike you as a criminal acting in a criminal way?"
Stillman, who stood next to a placard with a similar message about criminal intent, also told the jury, "Mark had no criminal intent because his intentions were honest.
No criminal intent means no crime."
Jurors in the retrial, which is expected to last about four months, are expected to hear the first testimony on Monday.
Rebutting each of the accusations the prosecution made on Wednesday during its opening argument, Stillman also sought to dissuade the jury from putting any stock in one of the prosecution's main pieces of evidence, the company's board minutes.
The prosecution said it plans to show that the board approved none of the bonuses paid to Kozlowski and Swartz and documented in the minutes.
Stillman said the minutes "cannot be relied on to prove anything" because they are incomplete.
He went on to say that he planned to prove that "the directors kept no minutes for half of their meetings."
He added, "You will hear of meeting in which important decisions were made and no minutes."
As he closed, Stillman told the jury to pay attention to what the directors actually did, not what they said.
"My mother taught me actions speak louder than words," he said.
A federal judge has allowed Tyco International Ltd. shareholders to go forward with a class action lawsuit against the company and others.
But U.S. District Judge Paul Barbadoro on Thursday struck down a related claim that sought damages on behalf of Tyco stemming from allegations of fraud and corporate looting.
Former top executives L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz are awaiting retrial in federal court in New York on charges of stealing $600 million (euro483.33 million) from the company.
Their first trial resulted in a hung jury.
They have denied the charges.
Barbadoro dismissed the claim seeking damages on behalf of Tyco against most of its current directors and several of its former directors and officers.
Barbadoro said it was barred under Bermuda law.
Tyco, managed from West Windsor, New Jersey, is registered in Bermuda.
"This represents a big shareholder win and a major step forward in the case," Jay Eisenhofer, the plaintiffs lawyer, said in a statement.
Barbadoro rejected the defendants' attempt to separate the accounting fraud allegations from the looting allegations, finding "both interrelated and interdependent."
In the class action lawsuit, shareholders seek damages against the company, Kozlowski, Swartz, Mark Belnick, former director Frank Walsh, and the company's auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers.
According to some estimates, investors lost $60 billion (euro48.33 billion).
In a prepared statement, Tyco spokesman David Polk said: "We believe we have a very strong case, and we are prepared to defend it vigorously."
L. Dennis Kozlowski wants to be clear: The $6000 shower curtain wasn't his idea.
The shower curtain, bought by his decorator on Tyco International's tab for an extravagantly furnished Manhattan apartment, became perhaps the most notable symbol of corporate excess and conspicuous consumption of the 1990s.
"I understand why a $6000 shower curtain seems indefensible," Kozlowski, Tyco's former chief executive, said on the eve of his retrial on charges of looting the company.
"But I didn't know about it.
I just wasn't even aware of it."
Dressed in a pair of jeans and hiking boots, Kozlowski did not look much like a swashbuckling, custom suit wearing chief executive.
He did not sound like one either.
Soft spoken and uncharacteristically reticent at times, Kozlowski, in his first extensive interview since he was charged more than two years ago with stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from Tyco, said that he was innocent and that the public perception of him was misguided.
"People think that I'm a greedy guy, that I was overcompensated," he said, leaning forward in his chair.
"Greed, I think, is the key word.
But while I did earn enormous sums of money, which for a poor kid from Newark was spectacular, I worked my butt off, and it was all based on my performance in Tyco's long established pay for performance culture."
That image of greed, of course, stems from accusations that he not only awarded himself unauthorized bonuses, but that he had the company also pay $15000 for an umbrella stand and half the cost of a multimillion dollar birthday party for his second wife in Sardinia, with a now notorious ice sculpture of Michelangelo's "David" that flowed vodka.
But Kozlowski, who faces a second trial on Tuesday in New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan, portrayed himself as a self made entrepreneur who has become the victim of an overzealous prosecutor interested in sensational headlines and a board trying to protect itself from shareholder lawsuits.
While clearly anxious about the retrial and humbled by the enormity of the situation, he remained unapologetic about his conduct at Tyco.
"I firmly believe that I never did or intended to do anything wrong," he said.
"I never thought in my wildest imagination I or any of us did anything wrong my entire time there.
I still cannot believe that they say words like larceny."
It is a long way down from flying on private jets and being driven everywhere by a chauffer.
"I'm given an allowance to pay for food and, you know, basic essentials that I need," Kozlowski said.
The case against him, he argued, should have been heard in a civil court, not criminal.
"I do believe this is a civil case between Tyco and I.
After 27 years, there was an unamicable breakup, a faulty divorce.
And I do believe this should be ironed out in a civil manner and certainly not in a criminal manner."
Jury selection began Tuesday for the second trial of two former top Tyco International Ltd. executives charged with looting the company of $600 million (euro459 million) to subsidize their lavish lifestyles.
Prosecutors promised to present a leaner case this time against former Tyco chairman and CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski and former chief financial officer Mark Swartz.
In the first trial, prosecutors played a videotape of the $2 million (euro1.53 million) birthday party Kozlowski threw for his wife on a Mediterranean island, and a video tour through his $18 million (euro14 million) Fifth Avenue apartment.
This time around, prosecutors were expected to focus less on items such as Kozlowski's $6000 (euro4600) gold threaded shower curtain and more on how he and Swartz allegedly looted the company.
The retrial is expected to last about four months.
Kozlowski, 58, and Swartz, 44, are charged with grand larceny, falsifying business records, conspiracy and business law violations.
The defendants each face up to 30 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charges.
Their first trial, which lasted six months, was aborted last year because of a menacing letter and telephone call to a juror.
Kozlowski and Swartz are accused of stealing $170 million (euro130 million) by hiding unauthorized bonuses and secretly forgiving loans to themselves, and pocketing $430 million (euro329 million) more by pumping up Tyco stock with lies about the state of the company's finances.
Defense lawyers said Kozlowski and Swartz earned every penny they got from Tyco.
The judge has already thrown out the top charge in the original indictment enterprise corruption.
That count suggested that Kozlowski and Swartz had conspired with others to turn Tyco into a criminal enterprise.
Tyco, which has about 270000 employees and $36 billion (euro27.6 billion) in annual revenue, makes a wide range of products including electronics, medical supplies and security devices.
The company is based in Bermuda.
Its U.S. headquarters is in West Windsor, New Jersey.
The two former top executives of Tyco International Ltd. stole $150 million from the industrial conglomerate even though they were among the highest paid people in corporate America, a prosecutor told jurors as their retrial began Wednesday.
In a 3 1/2 hour opening argument, assistant Manhattan district attorney Owen Heimer said L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz earned almost $300 million in legitimate pay between 1999 and 2001, but took the additional money to finance sumptuous lifestyles that included purchases of lavish apartments and fancy artwork.
"This authorized compensation as huge as it was was just not enough for these two men," Heimer said.
"They had to have more, so they stole another $150 million."
The first trial of Kozlowski and Swartz ended in mistrial last April after a juror's actions upstaged the legal proceedings.
The juror, retired teacher Ruth B. Jordan, made a gesture in court that some observers interpreted as an "OK" sign to the defendants.
Jordan was identified by several news organizations and subsequently received a threatening letter, prompting the judge to declare a mistrial a week later.
On Wednesday, Jordan sat in the back row as Heimer finished his presentation.
"I'm interested that's all," Jordan said afterward in explaining her appearance.
She indicated that she may attend further court sessions, but would not come regularly.
"I've got a life," she said.
Kozlowski, Tyco's former chief executive, and his one time chief financial officer Swartz are accused of grand larceny, securities fraud and conspiracy in an alleged plot to loot the company and cheat shareholders.
The men, who have pleaded not guilty, face up to 30 years in prison if convicted.
Defense attorneys are scheduled to give their opening statements Thursday.
In the first trial, defense lawyers said the executives' actions were approved by the board, and that living an extravagant lifestyle is not a crime.
Heimer argued Wednesday that Kozlowski and Swartz committed a range of illegal acts, including drawing huge loans from the company and then instructing underlings to erase them from the books.
The men told Tyco employees that the board of directors had "forgiven" the loans through bonuses even though they hadn't, Heimer said.
After the first trial, several jurors criticized the Manhattan District Attorney's office for what they saw as an overly lengthy and ponderous presentation.
The trial had gone on six months before ending in mistrial.
Heimer appeared to be cognizant of that Wednesday as he delivered a crisp and methodical argument that focused on seven specific instances of alleged theft.
The retrial of two top Tyco International executives accused of stealing $600 million (euro458 million) of company money to finance lifestyles of gaudy excess is set to begin next week.
Legal experts say prosecutors should, and probably will, focus less on items like the $6000 (euro4580) gold threaded shower curtain bought with company money and concentrate more on the alleged thefts.
The first trial of L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz was aborted after six months last year by a menacing letter and telephone call to a juror.
Prosecutors have told the judge they expected to present a shorter, leaner case against Kozlowski, Tyco's former chairman and chief executive officer, and Mark Swartz, the former finance chief.
They expect it to last a little more than four months.
In the first trial in Manhattan's State Supreme Court, prosecutors gave jurors a videotaped look at the $2 million (euro1.53 million) birthday party Kozlowski threw for his wife on a Mediterranean island, and a video tour through his $18 million (euro13.75 million) Fifth Avenue apartment .
Jurors were told Kozlowski spent some $11 million (euro8.4 million) of Tyco's money to furnish the apartment with amenities such as a $4050 tablecloth and a $515 toaster.
There was also a $2900 set of hangers, a $4995 custom made blue and gold bedskirt, and a $2665 blue velvet pillow.
And those were the little things.
The jurors also saw a Persian rug that cost $191250, a George I walnut arabesque clock that set Tyco back $113750, an Ascherberg grand piano that cost $77000, and a pair of French antique stools, bought for $125000.
Prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau's office said at the time that the extravagances demonstrated the defendants' greed and showed where some of the money they allegedly stole ended up.
Kozlowski, 58, and Swartz, 44, are charged with grand larceny, falsifying business records, conspiracy and business law violations.
Prosecutors said the defendants stole $170 million (euro130 million) by hiding unauthorized bonuses and secretly forgiving loans to themselves, and pocketed an additional $430 million (euro328 million) by pumping up Tyco stock by lying about the state of the company's finances.
Defense lawyers said Kozlowski and Swartz earned every penny they got from Tyco.
The trial judge, Justice Michael Obus, has already thrown out the top charge in the original indictment enterprise corruption.
That count suggested that Kozlowski and Swartz had conspired with others to turn Tyco into a criminal enterprise.
If convicted of the current top charge, first degree grand larceny, and the other more serious counts, the defendants each face up to 30 years in prison.
Tyco, which has about 270000 employees and $36 billion (euro27.5 billion) in annual revenue, makes a wide range of products including electronics, medical supplies and security devices.
Prosecutors rewrote their opening script for the retrial of L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz on Wednesday, purging the most striking accusations of lavish spending that they had concentrated on during the first trial.
Instead, prosecutors focused on laying out the core theme of their case, saying the two men, former Tyco executives, had illegally awarded themselves millions of dollars in bonuses and concealed them from the company's board and shareholders.
"This case is the story of how two men the defendants in this case stole $150 million from a company named Tyco and that corporation's owners, its shareholders," said Owen Heimer, an assistant Manhattan district attorney, in his opening statement in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
"These defendants ran Tyco, but they did not own Tyco."
While the case against Kozlowski and Swartz is very similar to the first trial, the prosecution's new strategy conceived after hours of interviews with jurors from the previous trial who criticized their approach as unfocused may mean this trial could take on a markedly different tone.
The prosecution needed no reminder of that trial.
The lessons it had learned were already on display: Heimer, a veteran, was added to the prosecution's team and took the lead in opening arguments, while Kenneth Chalifoux, an assistant Manhattan district attorney who presented a meandering and often confusing opening during the first trial, looked on from the prosecution's table.
Lawyers for Kozlowski and Swartz are scheduled to present their opening arguments on Thursday.
Heimer spent much of his presentation arguing that Kozlowski and Swartz had intended to commit a crime.
In the last trial, at least one juror said she had been prepared to acquit on all charges because she could not find that the men had the requisite criminal intent.
Many other jurors said they, too, had wrestled with the issue of criminal intent.
Heimer repeatedly spoke to the jury of a process he described as "instruct, deceive and conceal."
He said he would show evidence that the men had instructed their subordinates to forgive loans, deceived the subordinates by telling them the bonuses had been approved by the board and then had concealed the payments from the board and the public by not disclosing them.
Heimer said the men had also paid their subordinates unapproved bonuses "because they were buying the employees' loyalty and buying the employees' silence."
The Triple Crown of corporate scandals reached full stride this week with the spectacle of three former big money CEOs on trial simultaneously.
Cases against Tyco's Dennis Kozlowski and WorldCom's Bernie Ebbers Jr. began last week in New York.
The trial of HealthSouth's Richard Scrushy launched Tuesday in Birmingham.
The coincidental confluence gives Americans a glimpse of corporate theater: Accountants in the limelight.
CEOs on hot seats.
Lavish lifestyles on display.
Legal and business academics say the cases raise questions about big themes, such as the delicate balance between a free market and government regulation.
But academics doubt Americans will be as riveted by the trials as they were by less significant courtroom dramas like the California case against wife murderer Scott Peterson.
"It's hard for a lot of people to get outraged.
They see them as a bunch of rich people ripping off a bunch of other rich people," said Robert Thompson, a Syracuse University professor of TV and pop culture.
Actually, corporate scandals hurt workers, clients and stockholders at all levels, Thompson said.
But plenty of educated Americans find it excruciating to sort through complex financial allegations to keep track of such malfeasance after recent government crackdowns, he said.
After all, this is just the latest bubble of corporate trials.
A similar round in 2003 and 2004 included the first trial of Tyco's Kozlowski which ended in a mistrial and cases against former Wall Street investment banker Frank Quattrone, former Rite Aid senior executive Franklin C. Brown and corporate chief/home maven Martha Stewart.
While corporate cases in recent years have tended to be big, allegations of wrongdoing are far from new in the world of business, said Emory law professor William Carney.
"My first reaction to some of these cases is, 'Ho hum, just another financial fraud case.'
" But Columbia University law professor John Coffee said the latest cases highlight how prosecutors are broadening what they consider corporate crimes they will pursue.
In past decades, business leaders usually faced only civil penalties for wrongdoing, except in cases of tax fraud, insider trading or price fixing, Coffee said.
"Now we are seeing virtually any kind of corporate scandal that involves the interest of investors will be examined and scrutinized by criminal enforcers," he said.
The allegations of the Tyco case including news of lavish parties and a $6000 shower curtain revolve around whether corporate executives had the permission of the company's board before embarking on "extraordinary conspicuous consumption," he said.
HealthSouth's Scrushy is fighting allegations of fraud and stock manipulation for supposedly trying to make the company's financial situation look better than it was, Coffee said.
Ebbers is charged with fraud after the collapse of the long distance phone company he founded.
The cases will focus public attention again on corporate misbehavior, Coffee said.
But Americans' views of what is reprehensible will be determined by "who goes to prison and for what."

A judge refused to combine a retrial of larceny charges against former Tyco International Ltd. chief executive L. Dennis Kozlowski with a trial on charges that he failed to pay sales taxes on $13 million worth of art.
In denying the prosecution's consolidation request on Monday, state Supreme Court Justice Michael Obus noted that the larceny trial, set to begin Jan 18, includes Tyco's former chief financial officer Mark Swartz, 44.
The judge said there is not enough evidence that Swartz was involved in the tax scheme to join that trial with the larceny retrial.
"There is no evidence that Swartz entered into any agreement, tacit or express, with either Kozlowski or the art vendors to avoid the payment of the sales tax," Obus wrote in his 11 page ruling.
The tax indictment charges Kozlowski, 57, with conspiracy, falsifying business records and tampering with evidence.
Obus had earlier noted that nonpayment of sales taxes is not a crime but it is a crime to fail to collect them.
Obus also said the charges involved different victims Tyco and its shareholders in the larceny case, New York state in the tax evasion case.
In the tax case, Kozlowski was accused of scheming with dealers to avoid paying more than $1 million on $13 million worth of artworks.
In the larceny case, Kozlowski and Swartz are accused of looting more than $600 million from Tyco.
If convicted on the first degree grand larceny charge after their retrial, Kozlowski and Swartz each could face up to 25 years in prison.
Tyco, based in Bermuda but with U.S. headquarters in West Windsor, New Jersey, makes everything from telecommunications equipment to home alarm systems.
There is a standard response to any inquiry about the writings or work of Judge John G. Roberts Jr., the Supreme Court nominee.
The White House defends his past work, which has offended both conservatives and liberals, with a single response: Roberts was representing his client or the position of the administration in power.
To some critics, that is a cop out.
Shouldn't lawyers, they argue, sometimes be held accountable for their arguments, even when they are being presented on behalf of someone else?
Don't lawyers, especially when they choose to work for the government, believe in the cases they represent?
Here is the lawyerly response: The answer is yes, except when it is no. Of course, it is nearly impossible at this point to tell which opinions and cases Roberts felt strongly committed to.
But many legal scholars say that is just the point.
They argue that the most impressive lawyers are known as much for their ability to break ideological ranks as for hewing to them.
In fact, these legal scholars say that lawyers, including Roberts, should be commended for their ability to argue against their natural grain.
That skill, lawyers say, requires more mental dexterity and creativity than simply advocating for your own opinion.
"If only people who are ideologically committed to a particular outcome argued to the courts, the law would be worse off," said Charles Fried, who served as solicitor general in the Reagan administration and is now a law professor at Harvard.
As an example, he cited John W. Davis, who he said made the Supreme Court argument against integration at the elementary school level in the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education case, but who reportedly was not himself an ardent segregationist.
"The profession is designed to help the court by making sure that the best possible arguments not misleading arguments, not arguments that stretch a point, not arguments that hide precedents but that the best possible arguments are presented," Fried said.
"That's the business we're in.
It's very much like if you were a doctor.
Do you only cure people who, when they're cured, will lead their lives as you were going to lead them?"
Still, a trend among prominent prosecutors leaving government for the private sector is to accept jobs as general counsel to a particular company an approach that reduces the possibility of having to accept undesirable cases as part of a big law firm, and offers some evidence that lawyers try to pick their cases and clients with care.
William P. Barr, the attorney general under former President George Bush, is head of the general counsel's office at Verizon.
Louis J. Freeh, the former director of the FBI, went on to become general counsel for the bank MBNA.
James B. Comey, the deputy attorney general, will head to Lockheed Martin Corp. in October as its top lawyer.
At the same time, some legal experts draw distinctions between cases lawyers are hired to take, ones that are worked on pro bono and ones that come in the course of working within the justice system for a state or federal government.
And within each of those categories there are further caveats: lawyers who are political appointees in the upper echelons of the Justice Department, for example, are considered more closely wedded to the positions argued for the sitting White House than lower ranking career officers who work for Democrats and Republicans alike.
By the same measure, a partner in a law firm who seeks out a particularly ideological case, either paid or pro bono, is more likely to be judged as supporting that case than a junior associate who had it land on his or her desk.
John Yoo, a prominent conservative legal scholar, held up Theodore B. Olson, the former solicitor general in the current Bush administration, as a model of a lawyer who should be proud of virtually all of his arguments.
Olson, he said, is "the sort of conservative, ideologically conservative, committed conservative, who takes pro bono cases that are designed to advance conservative causes."
In particular, Yoo cited the Hopwood case, in which Olson, as a private lawyer, successfully argued in front of the Supreme Court that the race based admissions policy of the University of Texas was unconstitutional.
"The important thing is, what are people doing in their free time?"
Yoo said.
"That's when you are explicitly almost supposed to take your own personal views into account."
Not all lawyers agree.
"There are some lawyers who think of themselves as basically instruments of whoever their clients are, and they pride themselves on their professional craft, " said Cass Sunstein, a law professor at the University of Chicago who was an adviser in the office of legal counsel in the Justice Department from 1980 to 1981.
"Then there are lawyers that think generally they'll do their best for their clients," Sunstein said, "but on some occasions will refuse to do cases that bother them, or sometimes seek out cases that make themselves feel good."
But according to Fried, the two are not mutually exclusive.
"I have turned down many cases where I say, 'You know, look, forget it, you're just wrong, there's nothing to be said on your side, I won't do it, find someone else,"' he said.
"But that's rarely the case at the Supreme Court level, because if a position is that wrong, it wouldn't have gotten that far."
John Roberts says his judicial rulings are determined solely by legal reasoning, not his personal beliefs and values.
"Judges wear black robes because it doesn't matter who they are as individuals," Roberts, President Bush's nominee for chief justice, told the Senate Judiciary Committee.
"That's not going to shape their decision.
It's their understanding of the law that will shape their decision."
Roberts' portrait of the ideal judge the detached legal scholar, operating on pure intellect raised a basic question about the nature of judging.
And it alarmed at least two senators, who implored him not to leave his humanity behind when he takes the bench.
"By becoming John Roberts the chief justice, don't ever forget to be John Roberts the man," Sen Mike DeWine, R Ohio, told Roberts at his confirmation hearing Wednesday.
"When you put on your black robe and assume your spot on the Supreme Court, you will truly bring with you your heart and your soul."
Sen Dianne Feinstein, D Calif., after hearing Roberts repeatedly refuse to state his views on the Roe vs. Wade abortion rights ruling and other past decisions, said she was concerned about "John Roberts the legal automaton."
"I don't expect you to say what you would do about Roe ,but I do expect to know a little bit more about how you feel and how you think," Feinstein said during Wednesday's hearing.
Roberts' self portrait as a judge animated by legal reasoning, divorced from personal beliefs, is the flip side of the stereotypical judicial activist the judge who elevates personal views above the law.
Conservatives scornfully single out the late Chief Justice Earl Warren, who would interrupt lawyers' recitations of legal precedents by asking, "But is it fair?"
On the other hand, said Vikram Amar, a law professor at UC Hastings in San Francisco, psychology and common sense dictate that "who the person is has to affect how the judge behaves."
One way to frame the issue is whether judges can retain their humanity without losing sight of the law and becoming politicians with gavels.
Legal scholars offered varying assessments.
"There are going to be cases that judges will look at differently because of the values and backgrounds they bring," said Stanford Law Professor Pamela Karlan.
"Otherwise, why didn't President Bush just nominate some random smart federal judge?"
For example, she said, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who became the court's first female justice when President Ronald Reagan appointed her in 1981, graduated from Stanford Law School with honors but couldn't get a job as a lawyer.
That experience clearly affected her sympathetic approach to sex discrimination cases, Karlan said.
Roberts "can't possibly mean it," Karlan said of his assertion that personal values are irrelevant.
"It's the kind of thing every judge says, and everybody knows it's not completely true."
But John Yoo, a UC Berkeley law professor and a former Bush administration Justice Department official, said Roberts wasn't really claiming that he could, or should, close his eyes to all personal experiences in his rulings.
Instead, Yoo said, Roberts was expressing a difficult but desirable goal that judges should "try to put all prejudices, biases and feelings aside and decide cases as neutrally as possible.
Otherwise, why not just have elections for judges?"
The classic case, Yoo said, involved Northern judges who ordered the return of escaped slaves to their masters before the Civil War, obeying the Fugitive Slave Law and overriding their consciences.
Though history applauds the judges who found ways around the law, Yoo said, true judicial values require judges to follow the law or resign from the bench.
Roberts used similarly absolutist terms when asked Tuesday by Sen Charles Grassley, R Iowa, whether there was room for personal values in constitutional interpretation.
"You don't look to your own values and beliefs," Roberts said.
"You look outside yourself to other sources."
He acknowledged at another point that "we all bring our life experiences to the bench," but said the goal of all judges should be to follow "the rule of law, not their own preferences."
Under renewed questioning Wednesday, Roberts insisted that he didn't discard his values when he became a judge.
"The cause I believe in passionately, the one to which I have dedicated my career, is the vindication of the rule of law," Roberts said.
Amar said Roberts appeared to be attempting to bolster the metaphor he first used Monday of the judge as an umpire calling balls and strikes.
The comparison oversimplifies the judicial role and ignores the effect of personal experience, Amar said.
Not all cases engage a judge's values, said Stanford's Karlan, for example, the meaning of a disputed federal law may be resolved by a grammatical inquiry.
But she said other questions, like the meaning of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law or the ban on cruel and unusual punishment, may turn as much on judges' individual perspectives as on their dissection of legal precedent.
For example, she said, the late liberal Justice William Brennan and conservative Chief Justice William Rehnquist were "two smart, dedicated individuals reaching different views, based on precisely the same (constitutional) language."
The Federalist Society has brought together many of Washington's top conservative thinkers over the last few decades, but Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito has been more open than some of his peers about his involvement with the low profile legal group.
Alito has been a member for at least 15 years and has spoken before both the national organization and its student chapters on a number of occasions.
That's a welcome change for the group after the last two Supreme Court nominations.
The Supreme Court Chief John Roberts, the new chief justice, is well liked by Federalist Society members but belatedly denied he'd ever been a member of the organization after he was nominated to the high court, even though he once was listed in its leadership directory.
Harriet Miers, who withdrew her nomination to the court, once testified that she "wouldn't belong to the Federalist Society" or other "politically charged" groups that "seem to color your view one way or another."
As she tried to salvage her nomination, Miers quickly put out word that she regarded the Federalist Society as an important White House ally, but the damage already had been done.
Her deprecating remarks from 1989 had further angered some conservatives already upset about her nomination.
Notre Dame law professor Rick Garnett, a member of the Federalist Society, complained recently that the organization doesn't always get the recognition from the right that it deserves for supplying "in no small part, the intellectual heft for a large part of today's conservative movement in politics."
"Too often, this administration, present nominees, and even Federalist Society members nominated for important government positions have treated the society as if it were something out of 'The DaVinci Code,' or the ultra secret gaggle of powerful reactionary Rasputins that some on the left imagine, or just a goofy band of train spotters," he wrote in a blog posting.
The society, founded in 1982 as a forum for conservative and libertarian lawyers to exchange ideas and network, keeps its roster private.
But Alito been open about his membership in the group.
As a federal appeals court judge, Alito's participation in the society has been limited to avoid any suggestion of bias on issues that could come before his court.
He moderated a panel discussion about the anti terrorism laws that make up the Patriot Act at the society's November 2004 national conference, introduced a debate on the independent counsel law at the 1989 national conference, and has addressed the society on other occasions.
An article he wrote on the role of the lawyer in the criminal justice system, based on a speech he made at the 1997 convention, was published in one of the society's newsletters.
Even with all of that involvement, though, there are no open congratulations coming from the society's leadership about Alito's nomination to the high court.
"We really don't comment on things in that type of way," said society President Eugene A Meyer.
Leonard Leo, the society's executive vice president, took a leave of absence to help push through Bush's Supreme Court nominees but Meyer said Leo is back at work now coordinating the society's next national conference, which begins next week.
Leo made no public comment on Alito's nomination but helped lead a conference call Monday with conservative groups and legal experts, and will continue to work for the nomination on his own time.
The quiet reaction of the society's leadership notwithstanding, Alito's Federalist Society membership is seen as "an important signal to conservatives in the legal community," said John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who worked in the Bush Justice Department during 2001 03.
"It shows an interest in thinking deeply about the role of the courts in society and the proper interpretation of the Constitution based on its text and history," said Yoo, himself a member of the Federalist Society since his college days.
Yoo said the administration has been sensitive about the society's influence ever since receiving criticism early on from liberals unhappy with the Bush team for drawing heavily from the society's ranks for top government jobs and judicial nominations.
Duke law professor Erwin Chemerinsky, a liberal who has spoken at Federalist Society events, said membership is one more way of letting conservatives know that Alito is "one of them," although it shouldn't be a basis for questions at his Senate confirmation hearing.
But Ralph Neas, president of the liberal People for the American Way, disagreed, saying Alito's membership in the society is fair game for the hearings.
"Of course membership in or participation in Federalist Society events doesn't disqualify someone from office but it can help people understand the judicial philosophy of the nominee," Neas said.
"The Federalist Society likes to pretend it's just a debating club, but for last 20 years it has been at the forefront of the efforts to push a right wing counterrevolution in the courts and undo decades worth of precedent."

As the nation approaches the fourth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, there is fresh unease about the government's ability to prevent another strike on American soil.
The recent bombings in London and Egypt, yet another overhaul of the federal Homeland Security Department and nervousness about the Iraq war are prompting fresh debate about whether the country is making sufficient progress against the terrorist threat.
"The key questions are: Are we as safe as we need to be?
Are we as safe as we can be?
And are we as safe as we think we are?" said Clark Ervin, former inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security.
"The answer to all of these questions, sadly, is no." Opinion polls show the public's expectation of a domestic attack is rising, with nearly half telling the Gallup Poll they fear that they or someone in their family will become a terrorism victim.
Also growing are the numbers of Americans who believe the Iraq war has made the United States less safe from the terrorism threat.
Meanwhile, only 34 percent think the United States is winning the terror war, a July Gallup Poll showed.
The angst spilled over in Congress recently, when Rep Norm Dicks, D Wash., complained about inaction by the Homeland Security Department in assessing the threat of a nuclear bomb's detonation in a major American city.
"There is a great deal of anxiety on the Hill and in the country about how well the Department of Homeland Security is doing," Dicks told the department's new chief, Michael Chertoff.
"You have got to show the country that there is a leader now in charge of homeland security,We have got to deal with the major threats ,the use of a nuclear device, for example."
Chertoff defended his early stewardship of homeland security efforts, and in fact endorsed Dicks' general point, saying the United States must devote the vast majority of its prevention resources to stopping catastrophic attacks.
To the dismay of big city officials who want more money spent on mass transit security, Chertoff has been using his honeymoon period as homeland security chief to argue that the country can't afford to waste precious dollars trying to stop subway bombings.
"A fully loaded airplane with jet fuel, a commercial airliner, has the capacity to kill 3000 people.
A bomb in a subway car may kill 30 people," Chertoff told the Associated Press.
"When you start to think about your priorities, you're going to think about making sure you don't have a catastrophic thing first."
Although Chertoff is winning some plaudits for his focus on risk assessment, critics say the country's overall homeland security remains far too weak, rife with wasteful spending and unprepared to meet the challenges of another attack.
"America does not have a culture of preparedness," said Jay Carafano, a security expert at the Heritage Foundation who in a recent analysis suggested homeland security officials have been manufacturing "symbolic programs that create the illusion of caring."
Government officials say it should not be surprising that it would take some time for the massive homeland security bureaucracy now just two and a half years old to get its arms around the monumental challenge of protecting such a sprawling country from attack.
The Department of Homeland Security, authorized by Congress in November 2002, is a compilation of 22 separate federal agencies employing 180000 people.
"It took several decades of organizational and legislative tweaking to revitalize the ,Department of Defense," said Tom Ridge, the department's inaugural director and former secretary.
Ramping up a national anti terrorism effort is necessarily an evolutionary process, Ridge said, because Americans are slowly coming to grips with the reality of a newly unsafe world.
Ridge and other officials involved in the terrorism fight also contend they've made major progress.
"We are, I will say, far safer than we were before September 11th," FBI Director Robert Mueller said last week.
(7/27/05) But critics say that, given the potential consequences of a catastrophic attack, federal officials have not moved smartly enough, or quickly enough.
At the congressional hearing where he lectured Chertoff, Dicks noted that a nuclear bomb could kill 1 million people in New York or Washington.
This and multiple other hearings in Congress this summer have highlighted the enormity of the challenge facing homeland security officials, and the difficulty of choosing among vastly different prevention strategies.
Chertoff is attempting to give the Homeland Security Department a harder nosed edge by adopting the "risk assessment" model for determining what merits taxpayer dollars and what doesn't.
He stuck with that line even in the aftermath of the London subway bombings, angering big city politicians who wanted to add millions to mass transit security.
With some reluctance, Congress is also shifting to the risk assessment standard.
Members of Congress have come under harsh criticism for handing out millions in homeland security grants to states like Wyoming and South Dakota places that are deemed low security risks.
But for the second straight year they are reducing the proportion of money going to largely rural states while beefing up funds for big cities.
Even then, however, there are widespread debates over what constitutes the best use of homeland security money.
Should aviation security continue to be the No. 1 priority?
Should more go into border controls?
Is technology the answer?
Veronique de Rugy, a critic of homeland security spending from her perch at the American Enterprise Institute, says federal officials are right to focus on detecting a nuclear bomb that might enter the country through one of its ports.
But she says the deployment of 470 radiation portal monitors is a good example of how the government may be wasting enormous sums of money.
Nuclear security experts don't believe the monitors can detect, with any reliability, the highly enriched uranium that is at the heart of a nuclear device, she said.
"Have we really spent $800 million for nothing?" she wrote for the website Tech Central Station.
"Possibly."
Some say that, given the difficulty of building reliable defenses against terrorism, the government ought to spend far more on intelligence aimed at foiling plots before they unfold.
According to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, only 8 percent of federal homeland security dollars are devoted to intelligence and counterterrorism this year.
By comparison, 37 percent of the funds are being spent on border and transportation security operations, 31 percent on protecting critical infrastructure, and 17 percent for emergency preparedness.
Michael O'Hanlon, a security expert at the Brookings Institutions in Washington, says much more needs to go toward counterterrorism, particularly in the 25 to 35 largest American cities.
O'Hanlon recently recommended that Congress pay for 10000 additional police in those cities who, working jointly with the FBI, would be the eyes and ears that might uncover domestic terrorist cells.
"Too many localities, even major ones, assume that they will not be targets in the future simply because they have not been the sites of successful attacks in the past," he said.
Sen Joe Biden, D Del., offered similar advice last week.
"It's more likely to be some local cop coming from the Dunkin' Donut shop, going behind a super mall ,that detects a guy climbing out of a dumpster who just put sarin gas in the ventilation system," said Biden.
Others advocate a far more aggressive national strategy that relies on face to face confrontation of terrorists.
John Yoo, a deputy assistant attorney general during Bush's first term, says the United States must become more ruthless and cunning to counteract the resiliency of the al Qaeda terrorist network.
For example, he says the United States should carry out simultaneous assassinations of key al Qaeda leaders.
He also suggests setting up false terrorist organizations that would carry out fake attacks, issue phony claims of credit for real attacks, and compete for recruits with al Qaeda all in an effort to "sow confusion within al Qaeda's ranks."
Yoo acknowledged that setting up bogus websites, issuing fake public statements and using taxpayer funds for these purposes might run afoul of existing laws.
But Yoo, a staunch Bush supporter, said the president's current strategies may not be sufficient to protect American soil.
"Al Qaeda has suffered devastating losses at the hands of the CIA and the U.S. armed forces," he said in a speech last month.
"But it has not suffered a knockout blow and may even be recovering."

WASHINGTON As President Bush's counsel, Harriet E. Miers continued the expansive interpretation of presidential powers favored by her predecessor, Alberto Gonzales, who backed Bush's authority to hold terrorist suspects without trial, as well as the White House's right to withhold more administration documents from public disclosure than in the past.
Miers has also been outspoken in her support of reauthorizing the USA Patriot Act, which gave the executive branch new powers of surveillance over US citizens.
Now, Miers is Bush's choice to join the Supreme Court.
That selection determines how much power a president can wield under the Constitution.
Her nomination, announced Monday, followed the confirmation of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who supported broad war powers for the president in a case he heard during his brief tenure as an appellate judge.
The two appointments, both of lawyers with extensive White House experience, have raised alarm among critics of the Bush administration's broad reading of executive branch authority.
"The fact that the president is now seeding the Supreme Court with people who have been handmaidens in his efforts to increase the power of the executive without any check or oversight whatsoever is very disturbing," said Bill Goodman, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, which sued Bush on behalf of prisoners at the US facility at Guantanamo Bay.
Supporters of Miers, too, have invoked her work on Bush's terrorism policies to assuage fears among some conservatives that she may be too moderate.
"In her work respecting the War on Terror and the threats posed to our country by misuse of foreign and international law, Ms Miers has applied the Constitution as the Framers wrote it," wrote Leonard Leo of the conservative Federalist Society.
A New York University law professor, David Golove, said that executive power is emerging as a defining issue for the Supreme Court in the post Sept 11, 2001, era.
In case after case, the Bush administration has argued that it has the authority to take measures it deems necessary to stop terrorists, while others have insisted on maintaining checks and balances.
"Executive power issues are going to be coming before the court that are of tremendous significance," Golove said, pointing to challenges to Patriot Act surveillance powers, the treatment of Guantanamo Bay prisoners, and the case of Jos Padilla, a US citizen being held without trial under the authority asserted by Bush to imprison anyone whom the government suspects of being a terrorist.
As the lineup of the Supreme Court evolves, so may its rulings on how much power the Constitution gives the president.
That prospect has sent analysts hunting for clues in the records of Bush's nominees.
This summer, for example, when Roberts was still an appeals court judge, he was part of a three judge panel that ruled that Bush could bypass the Geneva Conventions, which require that prisoners of war be given court martials, and could instead try a detainee before a military commission.
Their holding reversed a district court's finding that the president had exceeded his authority.
And in a speech in April 2005,before a GOP lawyers' group, Miers said that reauthorizing the entire Patriot Act was "critical," because it "has been used in so many ways to help protect this nation and its people and in the war on terror."
Miers made her speech in the context of bipartisan calls to amend the law with stronger checks on new surveillance powers.
Miers was also part of the administration's legal team when it developed both the Patriot Act and the detention policy for suspected terrorists.
Her role in those internal deliberations, however, is unknown to the public.
Some conservatives wonder whether Miers personally supports the administration's approach, or is just backing her client's official policy.
Among those raising questions is John Yoo, a former Justice Department official who helped to draft the Patriot Act and who wrote a memo arguing that Bush could authorize aggressive interrogation techniques, despite laws against torture.
Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, wrote in an article appearing Tuesday in The Washington Post that Miers might shore up conservative support if the White House disclosed her private advice to the president about the extent of his executive power.
"She may be one of the key supporters in the Bush administration of staying the course on legal issues arising from the war on terrorism," Yoo wrote.
"But it is hard to see how the administration could reveal Miers's position on these issues, given its tough, five year struggle to preserve the confidentiality of executive branch deliberations."
Years ago, Miers argued against expanding government powers in the face of despite security threats.
In July 1992, as the president of the Texas bar association, Miers warned against responding to a courtroom shooting spree by infringing "on precious, constitutionally guaranteed freedoms."
"The same liberties that ensure a free society make the innocent vulnerable to those who prevent rights and privileges and commit senseless and cruel acts," Miers wrote in Texas Lawyer magazine.
"Those precious liberties include free speech, freedom to assemble, freedom of liberties, access to public places, the right to bear arms and freedom from constant surveillance.
We are not willing to sacrifice these rights because of the acts of maniacs."
With no one sure where Miers would stand on executive power as a justice, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, said he will question her on the issue to make sure she is capable of "judicial independence."
As she prepares for such questions, Miers may look to Roberts's testimony last month.
Promising the Senate that he would bring an impartial look to cases that involve challenges to executive power, Roberts cited the late Justice Robert Jackson as a role model.
Before he joined the Supreme Court, Jackson was attorney general under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
In 1940, before the US was involved in World War II, Jackson adopted an expansive reading of executive power by arguing that Roosevelt had the authority to defy the Neutrality Act by sending destroyers to Britain for use against Nazi Germany, Golove said.
Yet years later, as a justice on the court during the Korean War, Jackson ruled that President Harry Truman lacked the authority to seize steel mills in the name of national security, even in wartime.
"The Constitution is the only interest I have as a judge," Roberts said.
"The notion that I would compromise my commitment to that principle that has been the lode star of my professional life since I became a lawyer,is one that I reject entirely.
That would be inconsistent with the judicial oath.
And Justice Jackson is a perfect example of that."
To his shrillest student critics, University of California, Berkeley, law professor John Yoo a mild mannered, baby faced academic who gravitates toward the driest of legal treatises and the sharpest of suits incarnates the banality of evil.
Yoo has been accused of being a war criminal.
Cursed out in public.
Warned by Berkeley police, last spring, that it might not be safe to appear on a law school panel.
"That was pretty wild," said Yoo, the author of a new book, "The Powers of War and Peace."
"That was the most out of control thing that ever happened to me."
As Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice attempts to lessen anger in Europe over reports that the CIA has operated secret prisons in European countries, it might not be the best time for Yoo to argue his contention that the Bush administration has the right to hold "enemy combatants" indefinitely without charges, and question them without a lawyer present, in wartime.
Although even Rice seemed to reverse her administration's contention that the prohibition on cruel or inhumane prisoner interrogations didn't apply overseas, Yoo is still ardently opposed to such a ban, saying it could cripple the effectiveness of coercive interrogations abroad.
And even some of Yoo's fellow conservative intellectuals are disturbed by his contention that President Bush has the constitutional power to unilaterally start a war.
Yoo has been in perpetual hot water since the revelation that he helped draft a controversial memo in 2002 he was a deputy assistant U.S. attorney general at the time that narrowly defined torture as suffering "equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death."
But if being a flak catcher for the Bush administration's most criticized wartime practices has unnerved Yoo, it's not apparent when he touts his new book, which was released this fall.
If he ends up with more critics than readers, so be it.
Yoo does not employ the usual rationale for a strong Bush presidency.
He says in his book that it is not the Sept 11 terrorist attacks that justify the extraordinary presidential powers he advocates.
In Yoo's view, the constitution itself gives the president lots of leeway, allowing him to invade Iraq without congressional permission and to disregard such treaties as the Geneva Convention, which governs the moral code of conduct of war.
"I'm pretty sure that's an argument no one has ever made before," Yoo, 38, said recently with evident pride.
Most people, he said, "say the world's too dangerous and the Constitution's obsolete."
Michael Glennon, a professor of international law at Tufts University, believes that Yoo "sees the president essentially as an elected king."
"It strains the imagination to believe that those who wrote our Constitution could so quickly forget the danger that flows from unlimited power," Glennon said.
"If the framers truly intended to create a Sun King, why did they explicitly assign so many powers to the Congress?"
To answer this question, Yoo relies partly on the dictionary.
Although the Constitution gives Congress the exclusive power to "declare" war, that wording doesn't mean the president needs to consult Congress to "make war" or "commence war," Yoo's book says.
Yoo's critics say this relegates Congress to the role of an ambassador making a courtesy call: Excuse me, in case you hadn't noticed, we're bombing you to smithereens.
"I like John Yoo, but I disagree with many of the things he says about the inherent powers of the president," said Abraham Sofaer, a legal adviser to the State Department under the Reagan administration, who has argued for years for a more aggressive approach against terrorism.
"What Yoo seems to be saying is that the president has this whole set of powers in matters of defense that Congress cannot override," said Sofaer, now a senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution.
"I don't believe there are any powers that the president has that Congress cannot override."
What most concerns him, Sofaer said, are Yoo's views on the treatment of detainees.
"The torture convention is written specifically for people who think their emergency is different than any other emergency in human history," Sofaer said.
"You can't just say that because you happen to be governing the United States during an attack unprecedented since Pearl Harbor, that all the conventions governing the rules of war go out the window."
As criticism grows, some of Yoo's positions seem to be getting lonelier.
Yoo opposed the amendment by Sen John McCain, R Ariz., that would ban "cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment."
The Senate passed the amendment 90 9, with the backing of, among others, former CIA Director Stansfield Turner and former CIA Counterterrorism Center Director Vincent Cannistraro.
That doesn't dissuade Yoo.
"In the war against al Qaida, the Geneva Convention doesn't apply," Yoo explained in November on C SPAN.
"Al Qaida is not a nation.
Under the McCain amendment, all we could do is question people,The real effect of the McCain amendment would be to shut down coercive interrogation."
To Yoo, it is crystal clear who gets to decide the difference between coercive interrogation and torture abroad.
"Outside the United States it would be the president," Yoo said.
"If the president thinks that because of an extraordinary need to protect the country, he needs to order an interrogation, he needs to be able to do that.
"There's torture, and then there's cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment conduct below torture.
It's a broad term.
I think (the McCain bill) would prevent anything beyond oral questioning."
(Begin optional trim) Yoo's views on presidential powers stand out and not just in ultra liberal Northern California.
He believes, for example, that Bush has the final say on treaties.
"It's up to the president to decide how to interpret international law and apply it," Yoo said, speaking on his cell phone from a bustling Starbucks in San Francisco.
"President Bush has the sole power to decide whether to pull the United States out of treaties, break treaties, terminate treaties."
Or that the real check and balance held by Congress in wartime is budgetary.
"That's the primary check," Yoo said.
"If (Sen John) Kerry wanted to stop the war, all he had to do was convince his colleagues to not pay for it."
(End optional trim) As a conversationalist, Yoo is impeccably courteous, dispassionately affable, unfailingly polite.
His prose too is measured.
Even bland.
Which is precisely what inflames his critics.
"This hyper technical legal analyses detached from underlying moral and pragmatic considerations ,is a consequence of the law of war becoming 'overlawyered,' wrote retired U.S. Army Lt. Col Geoffrey S. Corn, the former special assistant to the judge advocate general for law of war matters, in a guest column for Jurist, the online legal news service of the University of Pittsburg School of Law.
"Unlike his chief antagonist, Senator John McCain, Yoo has never worn a uniform," wrote Corn, now a professor at South Texas College of Law.
Yoo does have his fans, to be sure.
Conservative legal scholar Robert H. Bork called the book a "brilliant and path breaking analysis."
Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Yoo served as a clerk for him and for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas called it "comprehensive," "thoughtful," "provocative."
Even some who ardently disagree with him praise his personal qualities.
Tuft's Glennon considers Yoo a friend.
"He's a very gentle soul.
He's a teddy bear," Glennon said.
"He's extremely courteous in dealing with intellectual adversaries.
He's a creative and original scholar."
However, he added, "I think his book is just 180 degrees off the mark."
In 1991, John G. Roberts Jr., then deputy solicitor general in the first Bush administration, told the Supreme Court its historic decision supporting a woman's right to an abortion was "wrongly decided and should be overruled."
In 2003, when Roberts was up for a judgeship, he played down his earlier statement, explaining that he only made the administration's case against Roe v. Wade because that was his responsibility as its lawyer.
After 11 years in government service and 10 years at one of Washington's largest law firms, Roberts has earned a reputation as a brilliant litigator who argues passionately for his clients' positions.
The question the Senate will debate as it decides whether to elevate him to the Supreme Court is which of those positions are also his own.
As a long standing member of the Republican National Lawyers Association who gave Republican Gov. Jeb Bush private legal advice during the 2000 presidential election recount in Florida, Roberts' political loyalties are plain.
As a former clerk to then Associate Justice William Rehnquist, a protege of former solicitor general Kenneth Starr and a member of the Federalist Society, his conservative credentials are solid.
But in his first two years on the federal bench, his opinions have been generally noted for dispassionate reasoning rather than inflammatory language.
Roberts' short time on the bench, coupled with the relative paucity of his writings, has left critics and potential supporters with little by which to judge how he will vote on the Supreme Court.
In his confirmation hearings for a federal judgeship in April 2003, Roberts maintained that he always separates his personal beliefs from his duty to follow the law including Roe v. Wade, which he described as a long settled precedent.
He reminded the Senate Judiciary Committee that John Adams once represented a British soldier involved in the Boston Massacre, proof that "the positions a lawyer presents on behalf of a client should not be ascribed to that lawyer," and said his own private legal practice had not been "ideological in any sense."
Roberts said he has represented supporters as well as opponents of affirmative action, and once helped a group of welfare recipients get their benefits restored.
As President Bush noted Tuesday night, 146 members of the D.C. bar Democrats as well as Republicans signed a letter calling him "one of the very best and most highly respected appellate lawyers in the nation," hailing his "unquestioned integrity and fair mindedness."
Those strong relationships on both sides of the Beltway's partisan divide could help smooth his Senate confirmation, enabling him to persuade conservatives that he won't be the next David Souter without worrying Democrats that he will be the next Antonin Scalia.
Still, his journey to the federal bench did not leave him unscathed.
He never came up for a vote the first time he was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by the first President Bush.
And his nomination to the same court by the second President Bush attracted opposition from the liberal Alliance for Justice and NARAL Pro America.
Many liberals suspect that the conservative positions he advocated in the Reagan administration were no different from the positions he would advocate on the court.
Many conservatives think so, too, even though Roberts is less outspoken and less aggressive than some of the other judges considered for the court.
"I know he's conservative by talking with him about issues," said Fred Fielding, for whom Roberts worked as a White House deputy counsel.
Fielding said Roberts supported expansive presidential powers, and tended toward a "more literal reading of the Constitution."
C. Boyden Gray of the Committee for Justice, a nonprofit conservative group established to support Bush nominees to the federal courts, called him a "brilliant choice."
John Yoo, a conservative professor of law at University of California at Berkeley who served in the Justice Department under the current Bush administration, emphasizes what he called Roberts' traditional approach to the law.
In the 39 cases that Roberts argued before the Supreme Court 25 of which he won Yoo said he never pushed the court to adopt "big new theories," but rather argued the facts of his cases.
"He's the type of person that business conservatives and judicial restraint conservatives will like, but the social conservatives may not like," Yoo said.
"What the social conservatives want is someone who will overturn Roe. v. Wade and change the court's direction on privacy," he added.
"But he represents the Washington establishment.
These Washington establishment people are not revolutionaries and they're not out to shake up constitutional law.
They might make course corrections, but they're not trying to sail the boat to a different port."
John Glover Roberts, 50, was born in Buffalo and grew up in the town of Long Beach, Ind.
The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive, he graduated first in his high school class, then attended Harvard University, graduating summa cum laude in only three years.
One of his advisers, William LaPiana now a law professor who says he "probably disagrees with Roberts about just about everything" recalls him as a rare font of middle America conservatism on a campus that was overwhelmingly liberal.
He also recalls Roberts as an unusually modest and mature young star who already displayed a judicial temperament.
Roberts then excelled at Harvard Law School, becoming managing editor of the prestigious Harvard Law Review, where he was known as something of a straight arrow.
David Leebron, who is the president of Rice University and was the editor of the review at the time, recalls that after working late they would often stop for ice cream.
Roberts always chose the same flavor: vanilla chocolate chip.
"I'm the type of person who wants to try other things, but he makes his choices and gets comfortable with them," Leebron said.
Roberts chose a fairly traditional path to legal prominence.
He clerked for Judge Henry Friendly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, in New York, then for Rehnquist.
He later worked as a special assistant to Attorney General William French Smith, then joined President Ronald Reagan's staff as an aide to White House counsel Fielding.
He joined the Washington law firm of Hogan & Hartson in 1986, then three years later joined President George H.W. Bush's administration, arguing cases before the Supreme Court as Solicitor General Starr's principal deputy.
Roberts' remarks criticizing Roe v. Wade were included in a brief he co authored arguing that barring federal financing of abortion counseling fulfilled the intent of a law that had not previously been interpreted in that manner.
Separately, he co wrote a brief that claimed an antiabortion group was not discriminating against women by trying to shut down abortion clinics through protests, the Supreme Court agreed with his argument.
While Starr's deputy from October 1989 to January 1993, Roberts wrote a brief urging the Supreme Court to accept the constitutionality of prayer at a public school graduation ceremony.
He also co authored a brief supporting a law criminalizing the burning of the American flag.
In both cases, the Supreme Court rejected those arguments.
In 1990 and 1991, according to his liberal critics, Roberts also co wrote briefs arguing against the imposition of a new desegregation decree for Oklahoma public schools and against the need to inform defendants that they may be sentenced to longer terms than agreed under a plea bargain.
The Supreme Court rejected the latter argument.
When his nomination to the circuit court died at the end of the first Bush administration, Roberts returned to Hogan & Hartson, where he headed the firm's appellate practice and frequently argued before the Supreme Court, winning a lot more than he lost.
He also became a millionaire, his net worth is between $2780039.44 and $6870000.
During his two stints at Hogan & Hartson, he represented varied corporate and professional clients.
The cases he considers most significant, according to his Senate testimony, involved his representation of a man convicted of filing false Medicaid claims, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the state of Hawaii, a road sign manufacturer, the Chrysler Corp., a group of coal companies, and Litton Systems.
Some of his liberal critics point in particular to a brief he wrote supporting the National Mining Association in its efforts to bar lawsuits by local citizens against a type of mineral extraction that involves blasting off the tops of mountains and dumping the debris in streams.
Roberts' name did not appear on any of the briefs during the Florida presidential vote recount, but sources say he gave Gov. Bush critical advice on how the Florida Legislature could name George W. Bush the winner at time when Republicans feared the courts might force a different choice.
Still, Paul Mogin his former law school roommate and co clerk, and a self described liberal said Roberts was nonconfrontational when it comes to politics.
"I doubt he has any particular agenda that he'd be going into the court with," said Mogin, who asked Roberts to be the best man at his wedding.
After being named to the appellate court in 2003, Roberts' first writing was a dissenting opinion from a decision by his colleagues on the U.S. Court of Appeals not to reconsider a three judge panel's ruling protecting a rare California toad under the Endangered Species Act. Roberts did not rule out the possibility that the act had been correctly applied, but thought the court ought to give a developer whose freedom of action had been restricted in favor of the toad another chance to make his argument that the Constitution did not permit the government to regulate activity affecting what he called "a hapless toad" that "for reasons of its own lives its entire life in California."
Besides the toad case, earlier this month he backed the administration's plan to let special panels of military officers conduct trials of terrorism suspects detained in the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, overturning a lower court decision that had blocked the "military commissions" for the past eight months.
The nominee is married to Jane Sullivan.
They have two children, John and Josephine, and have lived for more than a year in a three story federal style house on Meadow Lane in Chevy Chase, Md., that he purchased for $1.225 million in 2003.
It has a well trimmed lawn, and neighbor James McNaughton say Roberts often cuts it himself.
"He's Mr American," McNaughton said.
"He's kind of friendly, a nice fellow.
He doesn't buttonhole you and lecture you on politics or religion."
Another neighbor, Elizabeth White, a math specialist at a Montgomery County elementary school, said he is a "wonderful husband and a wonderful, devoted father."

Attorney General nominee Alberto Gonzales is promising senators that he will abide by treaties prohibiting the torture of prisoners, despite deriding the restraints as relics in 2002.
White House counsel Gonzales, in line to become the first Hispanic attorney general, had a hand in much of the White House's post Sept 11 terrorism policies as President George W. Bush's top lawyer.
His confirmation hearing Thursday offered Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee a fresh chance to criticize Gonzales and the advice he gave Bush.
Among the most contentious matters is a memo Gonzales wrote in January 2002 in which he argued that the fight against terrorism "renders obsolete" the Geneva Conventions' prohibitions against torture.
A month later, Bush signed an order declaring he had the authority to bypass the accords "in this or future conflicts."
Bush's order also said the Geneva treaty's references to prisoners of war did not apply to al Qaida or "unlawful combatants" from the Taliban.
Some of Gonzales' critics say that decision and his memo lead to the torture scandal at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison and abuses of detainees in U.S. custody in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
In testimony prepared for his hearing, Gonzales said Bush has made clear that the government will defend Americans from terrorists "in a manner consistent with our nation's values and applicable law, including our treaty obligations."
Gonzales added, "I pledge that, if I am confirmed as attorney general, I will abide by those commitments," according to the testimony obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press.
Last June, the Justice Department withdrew its 2002 memos arguing that the president's wartime authority supersedes laws and treaties governing treatment of prisoners.
On Wednesday, former Justice Department officials sought to distance the White House from its legal conclusions.
John Yoo, who helped write the memos while at the department's Office of Legal Counsel, said that while Gonzales was briefed on drafts, he and other officials did not attempt to influence the content.
"The idea that the Office of Legal Counsel was providing advice that was dictated, demanded or influenced by the White House, that's just flatly untrue," said Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley.
Gonzales has repudiated torture before.
"The president has stated that this administration does not condone torture.
If anyone engages in such conduct, he or she will be held accountable," Gonzales said in a White House online event on July 7.
Democrats, not satisfied with just those statements, planned to question Gonzales extensively.
"It is clear he was in the chain receiving this critical documentation relative to changing American standards on the treatment of prisoners, so he was not a bystander, he was part of it," said Sen Richard Durbin.
Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, said Bush firmly backs Gonzales' nomination.
"Judge Gonzales is a very trusted adviser to the president (and is) doing an outstanding job," McClellan told reporters traveling Wednesday with the president aboard Air Force One.
Democrats are expecting Gonzales to be confirmed by the Republican majority Senate.
"I have found him someone I could work with when he wasn't simply pursuing an agenda that was thrust upon him," said Sen Charles Schumer, a Democrat from New York.
Freshman Sen Ken Salazar of Colorado, who is Hispanic, was expected to join Sen John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, in introducing Gonzales at the hearing.
Civil rights and humanitarian groups have portrayed Gonzales as the person responsible for abuses by Americans against terrorism suspects held as prisoners.
"Mr Gonzales bears much of the responsibility for creating the legal framework and permissive atmosphere that led to the torture and abuse at Guantanamo and elsewhere," said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union.
Gonzales' memo from Jan 25, 2002, argued that the terrorism fight "renders obsolete Geneva's strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners and renders quaint some of its provisions."
In his prepared Senate testimony, Gonzales was repeating the contention that terrorists are not soldiers and thus are not covered by the conventions.
Nonetheless, according to his testimony, "We must be committed to preserving civil rights and civil liberties."
Democrats wanted to ask Gonzales about other terrorism issues, including the government's detention of Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen who the government alleges was part of an al Qaida plot to set off a radiological bomb.
Arrested after the 2001 attacks, Padilla later was designated an enemy combatant, brought to the brig in South Carolina and prevented from challenging his detention.
He has sued over his detention.
Some Republicans say Democrats are just setting up arguments to use against Gonzales in case Bush decides to elevate him to the Supreme Court, should a vacancy occur.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb 19: Of all the claims of an electoral mandate made by President Bush's supporters, none were as bizarre as the one offered by John Yoo, a former Justice Department lawyer who helped draft the cynical justifications for the illegal detention and torture of "unlawful combatants."
"The debate is over," Yoo told The New Yorker, adding: "The issue is dying out.
The public has had its referendum."
It's hard to know what is most outrageous about those comments that Yoo actually believes Americans voted for torturing prisoners or that an official who was at the heart of this appalling mess feels secure enough to say that.
Certainly the worst possibility is that the public has, indeed, lost interest.
The White House has done everything it can to bury the issue.
Nearly a year after the Abu Ghraib scandal broke, the administration still drags its feet on public disclosure, stonewalls congressional requests for documents and suppresses the results of internal investigations.
But the issue is as urgent as ever.
Hundreds of men remain imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, years after any information they had might have been useful and in defiance of two Supreme Court decisions.
American soldiers hold thousands of Afghan and Iraqi prisoners under rules that remain murky, to put it charitably.
American intelligence is still secretly detaining prisoners a practice that has become embarrassing enough for the Central Intelligence Agency to fret publicly about it.
And the administration continues to insist that the president has an imperial right to sweep aside the law and authorize whatever he wants.
That includes flouting treaties that prohibit sending prisoners to other countries to be tortured.
That abhorrent practice has become more common since 9/11 and is reported to include sending prisoners to Syria, a repressive nation counted by Washington as a state sponsor of terrorism.
Members of Congress from both parties are proposing new laws on interrogations.
Their intentions are honorable, and new legislation may be needed.
But drafts of these measures risk endorsing some terrible practices, as well as the idea that the president can declare himself above the law.
Anyway, it's too soon for new laws, we still don't know what happened and who approved it.
But that task is now way beyond the purview of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which held important hearings on prisoner abuse.
Republican congressional leaders have made it painfully clear that they will not hold a real investigation.
And no probe by the executive branch can be credible because the stain of prisoner abuse spreads so far.
The Justice Department can't do it, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was part of the problem.
We strongly agree with the American Bar Association, which wrote to President Bush on Feb 1 to urge the appointment of an independent, bipartisan commission with subpoena power.
The bar association talked about Iraqi civilians in military custody, but we believe that a panel should look at all detention centers and all government agencies.
Only a full accounting can begin to heal the nation's image in the world, clarify the rules, punish those responsible, and clear the names of the hundreds of thousands of other uniformed Americans who risk their lives to preserve human dignity and the rule of law.
Senate Judiciary Democrats and liberal allies have been hoping for months to get their mitts on internal administration documents relating to torture and prison abuses some of them involving attorney general nominee Alberto Gonzales.
There's little or no chance they'll get any of them.
The American Civil Liberties Union, for example, last week listed CIA, Pentagon, Justice Department and other memos and cables it wanted made public.
One item was described as a "memorandum from James Ho, attorney advisor, (Justice Department) Office of Legal Counsel, to John Yoo, deputy assistant attorney general, OLC, re: interpretation of Geneva Conventions' Common Article 3 (Feb 1, 2002)."
Most unlikely they'll find out what that one says.
Besides, Ho and Yoo have both left the department.
Yoo is teaching law at Berkeley, although Ho is said to be in this area.
Wait a minute!
Who was that good looking guy sitting behind Sen John Cornyn, R Texas, during Gonzales's hearing on Thursday?
Son of a gun.
It's James Ho, now Cornyn's chief counsel on the Constitution subcommittee.
Maybe the Judiciary Committee Dems ought to interview him?

A Justice Department lawyer wrote a secret memo to the White House in 2001 concluding that President George W. Bush has the authority to wage preemptive war against terrorists and countries even if they were not linked to the September 11 attacks, Newsweek magazine reported Saturday.
According to the memo there are effectively "no limits" on the presidents authority to wage war, Newsweek reports, noting that it seems to lay the legal groundwork for Bush to invade Iraq even without approval Congressional approval.
"The President may deploy military force preemptively against terrorist organizations or the states that harbor or support them, whether or not they can be linked to the specific terrorist incidents of Sept 11," the memo reads, according to Newsweek.
The memo, titled "The Presidents Constitutional Authority to Conduct Military Operations against Terrorists and Nations Supporting Them," argues that the president should be allowed to order whatever military action "in his best judgment" are necessary to protect the United States.
The presidents decisions to use force "are for him alone and are unreviewable," the memo reads.
The 15 page document, dated September 25, 2001, was written by conservative Justice Department lawyer John Yoo and addressed to White House counsel Alberto Gonzales.
Yoo has since left government and is a university law professor.
"There was a general awareness after Sept 11 that the enemy was not simply Al Qaeda but militant Islam in general," Brad Berenson, who served in the White House counsels office at the time, told Newsweek.
The memo was aimed at granting Bush authority to attack groups such as the Abu Sayef rebels in the Philippines or the militant Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah, Berenson told the magazine.
Alberto R. Gonzales, the White House counsel, intervened directly with Justice Department lawyers in 2002 to obtain a legal ruling on the extent of the president's authority to permit extreme interrogation practices in the name of national security, current and former administration officials said Tuesday.
Gonzales' role in seeking a legal opinion on the definition of torture and the legal limits of how much force could be used on terrorist suspects in captivity is expected to be a central issue in the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings, which are scheduled to begin on Thursday on his nomination to be attorney general.
The request by Gonzales produced the much debated Aug 1, 2002, memorandum by the Justice Department that defined torture narrowly and said that Bush could circumvent domestic and international prohibitions against torture in the name of national security.
Until now, administration officials have been unwilling to provide details about what role Gonzales had in the production of the memorandum by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.
He has spoken of the memo as a response to questions, without saying that most of them were his.
Current and former officials who talked about the memorandum have been provided with first hand accounts about how it was prepared.
Some discussed it in an attempt to clear up what they viewed as a murky record in advance of Gonzales' confirmation hearing.
Others spoke of the matter apparently believing that the Justice Department had unfairly taken the blame for the memo.
A White House spokeswoman, Erin Healy, said Tuesday that while Gonzales personally requested the August opinion, he was only seeking "objective legal advice and did not ask the Office of Legal Counsel to reach any specific conclusion."
As the White House's chief lawyer, Gonzales supervised the production of a raft of legal memorandums that shaped the administration's legal framework for conducting its battle against al Qaida and other terrorist groups.
Of the documents that have been made public, Gonzales is the author of only one.
In that January 2002 memorandum he advised Bush that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to fighters captured in Afghanistan.
As a result, a major area of questioning at his confirmation hearing is expected to be the role he played in the production of the other documents, like the August 2002 memorandum.
The memo concluded that interrogators had great leeway to question detainees using coercive techniques that they could assert were not torture.
The Justice Department last week formally rescinded that memorandum and in its place issued a legal opinion saying that torture should be more broadly defined and that there was no need to say Bush had the authority to sanction torture because he has unequivocally said that it is not permitted.
The revision stated that "Torture is abhorrent both to American law and values and international norms."
It rejected the language in the earlier memo that said only "organ failure, impairment of bodily function or even death" constituted torture punishable by law.
Administration officials said over the last few days that Gonzales had played a role in the decision to issue the new legal opinion as well, but they did not offer specifics.
Gonzales' request for the original August 2002 memorandum was somewhat unusual, the officials said, because he went directly to lawyers at the Office of Legal Counsel, bypassing the deputy attorney general's office, which is often notified of sensitive requests for legal opinions made by executive branch agencies, including the White House.
The memorandum has become one of the most hotly debated legal documents in the war on terror.
Democrats and human rights groups have complained that it created a permissive atmosphere that led eventually to serious abuses of detainees in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
The memorandum was addressed to Gonzales and was signed by Jay S. Bybee, then the head of the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department.
Officials dispute how much senior Justice Department officials knew of the memorandum as it was being prepared.
A former and a current official said that neither Attorney General John Ashcroft nor his deputy, Larry D. Thompson, were aware of the memorandum until it was about to be submitted to the White House.
Another former official said, however, that they were given progress reports as the memorandum took shape.
John Yoo, a senior Justice Department lawyer who wrote much of the memorandum, exchanged draft language with lawyers at the White House, the officials said.
Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said in an article published Sunday in the San Jose Mercury News that Gonzales did not apply any pressure on him to tailor the memorandum to accommodate the White House.
Instead, Yoo said that Gonzales was merely seeking to "understand all available options" in a perilous time when the United States faced unprecedented threats.
But a senior administration official disagreed, saying that the memorandum's conclusions appeared to align closely with the prevailing White House view of interrogation practices.
These officials said the memo raised questions about whether the Office of Legal Counsel had maintained its longstanding tradition of dispensing objective legal advice to its clients in executive branch agencies.
While the nature of Gonzales' specific discussions with the Justice Department remains unclear, administration officials said that Gonzales' customary way of dealing with Justice Department lawyers was to pose questions about issues rather than offer his own conclusions, although one said his preferences could sometimes be easily inferred from his questions.
,Department officials said that the timing of the revised memorandum, which was posted on the Justice Department's Internet site without announcement late on Dec 30, was the result of instructions from James B. Comey, the deputy attorney general.
Comey, the officials said, told lawyers to complete the revised opinion before the end of the year.
At the same time, officials said that they were mindful that issuance of the new opinion might help neutralize the issue for Gonzales even as it served as a sharp critique of the earlier opinion.
Gonzales talked about the 2002 memo in a meeting with reporters last June, when the White House sought to defend its actions at the height of the uproar over abuses of prisoners in Iraq.
Without discussing his own role in soliciting the document, Gonzales said that the memo was not a policy directive to officials in the field, but a response to questions about the scope of the federal law prohibiting torture and the international convention on torture.
"The president has given no order or directive that would immunize from prosecution anyone engaged in conduct that constitutes torture," Gonzales said.
"All interrogation techniques actually authorized have been carefully vetted, are lawful, and do not constitute torture."
Sen Patrick J. Leahy, D Vt., the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, who has signaled he intends to vigorously question Gonzales about his role in the memorandums, said Tuesday that he has been continually frustrated by the White House in trying to obtain answers and documents.
In a letter Tuesday to Gonzales, Leahy said that "I am disappointed that, contrary to your promises to me to engage in an open exchange and answer my questions in connection with your confirmation process, you have not answered my letters" requesting documents.
But Sen Arlen Specter, R Pa., who is the new chairman of the committee, said that Leahy's complaints appeared unjustified.
He said that one document was for a final version of a Jan 25, 2002, memorandum because the one available is marked "draft."
He said that there is no evidence that there is any document but the draft.
Other requests from Leahy, he said, were for documents that did not directly bear on Gonzales' actions or views.
The Jan 25, 2002 memorandum is an unsigned draft from Gonzales to Bush dated Jan 25, 2002.
In it, Gonzales, wrote that the fight against terrorism had made the Geneva Conventions "obsolete."
In addition, he said the conventions' prisoner of war protections need not apply to al Qaida suspects and Taliban members captured in Afghanistan.
John Yoo doesn't come across like a war criminal, though that's one of the more flamboyant charges leveled against the smooth young law professor from the University of California, Berkeley's storied Boalt Hall.
With his even tones and calm demeanor, his natty suits and warm charm, the 37 year old constitutional scholar is the embodiment of "reasonable," not the first person you'd expect to find at the heart of an international fight over terrorism, torture and the American way.
But while working for the Department of Justice after the Sept 11 terrorist attacks, Yoo helped write a series of legal memos redefining torture and advising President Bush that the Geneva Convention does not apply to members of al Qaida and the Taliban.
Sen Edward M. Kennedy, D Mass., demanded from the Senate floor last month that Yoo and other civilian officials be held accountable for their part in what he called the "torture scandal" over treatment of Iraqi detainees by American soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.
Legal scholar Scott Horton, president of the New York based International League for Human Rights, called last month for Yoo and others to be investigated as war criminals for their part in drafting the memos.
And in a lengthy analysis to be published in the Columbia Law Review this fall, Jeremy Waldron, an author, scholar and Yoo's former colleague at the UC Berkeley School of Law, said that the "defense of torture" by Yoo and other prominent lawyers had caused "dishonor for our profession."
A year after the abuses at Abu Ghraib came to light, nearly a year after the torture memos were leaked, debate over how the U.S. government should treat its prisoners shows no sign of abating.
"If you read the history of philosophy from the Greeks to the present day, the question of when should we be willing to do something terrible in pursuit of some social good is always posed," said Martha Nussbaum, professor of philosophy and law at the University of Chicago.
"It would surprise me very much that it would go away."
But as Yoo defends the memos, a measured messenger for some of the Bush administration's most controversial policies, he said he is surprised that "the issue has staying power."
The memos about the Geneva Convention and torture are probably the two most controversial documents Yoo worked on with a team of other lawyers when he was a deputy assistant attorney general with the Office of Legal Counsel from 2001 to 2003.
The former bears Yoo's name, the latter, that of then Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee, who now sits on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Some human rights advocates argue that the administration commissioned the memos to provide legal cover for increasingly coercive interrogation techniques used against suspected terrorists.
Yoo vehemently denies such accusations.
The administration has downplayed the memos' import and said that Bush never embraced the views of the lawyers who wrote them.
At the Council on Foreign Relations and West Point, at Columbia Law School and at his own leafy, liberal campus, Yoo argues that the world as America knew it ended on Sept 11, 2001, and that the rules of war have changed because the enemy has changed.
"Al Qaeda as a non state terror organization is not covered" by laws, such as the Geneva Convention, that are honored when the United States fights a bona fide state, Yoo argued earlier this month during a debate at Berkeley.
Thus, "our leaders have the option to decide what system ought to apply."
The debate was a two on one bruising in front of an audience that politely applauded Yoo while cheering his detractors, an event in which a law student dressed as an Iraqi torture victim greeted spectators with a sign that read, "War criminal John Yoo facilitated torture: He belongs in a prison not a law school."
But a funny thing happened near the end of the forum.
Tom Farer, dean of the Graduate School of International Studies at the University of Denver, was deep into a verbal salvo when he exhausted his allotted time but not his argument.
Yoo gave up one of his own precious minutes so that Farer could continue pummeling him.
"John cedes a minute," Farer said with a smile before launching back into his attack.
"John is a mensch."
Farer would find little argument, at least on that point.
Yoo inspires deep loyalty in friends, mute collegiality in many fellow scholars ("You know, I'd really rather not talk about him") and an awkward mixture of kindness and dread in some of his most vocal critics.
And although Boalt students circulated a petition last year demanding that Yoo recant his positions or resign, he also has charmed many of his liberal pupils with a ready classroom wit.
Others have been disappointed after signing up for one of his courses so they could hear what a fire breathing conservative actually sounds like only to find a mild mannered professor at the lectern, accessible and friendly.
"A lot of the concern is that people think he's dead wrong," said Ralph Steinhardt, professor of law and international affairs at George Washington University.
"But you have to understand, from a personal standpoint, he's a nice guy, has a good sense of humor, dresses nicely and is as smart as the day is long."
(Begin optional trim) A Korean immigrant who came to this country with his parents when he was 3 months old, Yoo has been a prolific writer of journalism and scholarship since his undergraduate days on the Harvard Crimson.
He is a regular contributor to the opinion pages of major newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, New York Times and Wall Street Journal.
Yoo began teaching constitutional and international law at UC Berkeley in 1993.
But he has spent many of the subsequent years bouncing back and forth between academia and government.
Shortly after Yoo took the Berkeley job, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas tapped him for a clerkship.
When his clerkship with Thomas ended, he headed to the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, where he served as general counsel and helped Sen Orrin G. Hatch, R Utah, with his speeches.
Hatch describes Yoo as "a terrific human being."
Yoo calls Hatch "a genuine softie."
Yoo completed a public service trifecta working in all three branches of government with a stint in the Office of Legal Counsel, part of the Department of Justice overseen by then Attorney General John Ashcroft, before returning to Boalt Hall last year.
It was there in the uncertain months after Sept 11 that Yoo worked on the memos that transformed him from a rising star in conservative legal circles to a lightning rod for international controversy.
(End optional trim) Many legal scholars and human rights activists along with Berkeley students draw a straight line linking the memos and alleged prisoner abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan and at Guantanamo.
Yoo argues that they do not understand how government really works.
"It's a stretch to say that a very limited, tightly held memo somehow translated into orders that soldiers on the ground violated human rights," Yoo said.
"That's the difference between law and policy."
To his critics, such an argument is disingenuous, but Yoo continues to defend the memos because he feels "some sense of obligation to explain to the public why government reached some of the conclusions it did."
"No one goes into government wanting to address these kinds of questions," he said.
"But we were attacked on Sept 11 with devastating results.
Our government has to think about these things in order to protect the country."
The question Democratic senators put to Condoleezza Rice last week seemed easy enough to answer: Did the secretary of State nominee consider interrogation practices such as "water boarding," in which a prisoner is made to believe he will drown, to be torture?
She declined to answer.
"I'm not going to speak to any specific interrogation techniques," Rice said, adding that it was up to the Justice Department to define torture.
About the same time, senators on another committee were asking nearly identical questions and receiving nearly identical answers from Alberto R. Gonzales, President Bush's choice for attorney general.
The back to back confirmation flare ups spotlight a problem the Bush administration faces in its policies for detaining and interrogating terrorism suspects.
In the months since the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, the administration has insisted that America does not and will not use torture.
At the same time, the government has attempted to preserve maximum leeway in the interrogation of terrorism suspects by not drawing a clear line between where rough treatment ends and torture begins.
"What the administration is saying is we're not going to torture people," said John C. Yoo, a University of California, Berkeley law professor who as a deputy assistant attorney general during Bush's first term worked on torture policies.
"What the administration does not want to say, and I think for good reasons too, is what methods the United States might or might not use short of torture."
Opponents say it is a moral, political and tactical mistake for the United States to blur that line.
They charge that the administration, while condemning outright torture, deliberately has sought loopholes in laws and treaties that would allow U.S. intelligence officers to use extreme interrogation methods on terrorism suspects held abroad.
To protest the administration's Iraq and anti terror policies and what they charged was the evasiveness of Rice and Gonzales under questioning Democratic senators have delayed both confirmation votes until later this week .
As a result, the full Senate likely will debate the definition of torture in a session that could embarrass the administration and provide fodder for its international critics.
Ambiguity on prisoner treatment is causing discomfort among some of the administration's allies.
Current and former military officers in particular fear it will result in the mistreatment of captured American soldiers.
"We've dramatically undermined the war effort by getting on the slippery slope in terms of playing cute with the law, because it's come back to bite us," Sen Lindsey Graham, R S.C., a former military judge, told Gonzales during a hearing earlier this month.
Graham said he was an "ardent" Iraq war supporter and agreed with the controversial administration view that the Geneva Convention which bans not only torture but also cruel treatment should not apply to terrorists.
However, Graham said, "Humane treatment is the way to go, the only way we can win this war."
Others say the Bush administration is right to preserve some secrecy about its methods for interrogating prisoners, lest terrorists learn how to thwart them.
"The only way we can stop future attacks by al Qaida is by learning from (captured suspects) what their plans are," Yoo said.
"It doesn't make sense to take options off the table at this time."
Others have questioned the effectiveness of harsh interrogation methods.
The FBI has said that the aggressive techniques its agents witnessed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and elsewhere were not effective in producing usable information.
The United States has recovered al Qaida training manuals that tell members what to expect if captured and instruct how not to crack under pressure just as the U.S. military trains its members on how to withstand questioning if captured.
"The last thing you'd want to do is publicly disclose how you interrogate people, because it would allow them to prepare their people to resist interrogations," Yoo said.
Gonzales made the same argument in a written response to senators' questions after he was faulted for dodging the question during his oral testimony.
A web of laws and treaties governs how prisoners are dealt with at home and abroad.
The torture convention bans torture and "cruel, inhumane or degrading" treatment.
The U.S. military code bans cruel treatment of prisoners, and CIA officials can be prosecuted for crimes such as assault when they are abroad.
The Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment within the United States.
Congress has defined torture as conduct intended to cause "severe" pain or suffering, according to the Justice Department, which noted in its latest memo that "there is no clear, objective, consistent measurement" of pain.
But legal experts differed last week over whether cruel treatment that falls short of torture is prohibited in the case of foreigners held abroad.
In an attempt to clarify American standards on torture and interrogation, Sen John McCain, R Ariz. who was tortured as a POW in North Vietnam and Sen Joe Lieberman, D Conn., wrote an unambiguous definition last fall: "No prisoner shall be subject to torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment that is prohibited by the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States."
But the language, included in an intelligence bill, was dropped after Rice wrote a letter saying it "provides legal protections to foreign prisoners to which they are not now entitled."
Under fierce confirmation questioning from Sen Barbara Boxer, D Calif., Rice offered a different justification for removing the provision: She said it was unnecessary because similar language was already included in a defense spending bill that the president had signed.
But Boxer said that provision had eliminated a specific prohibition on cruelty committed by intelligence officers, who have been implicated in abuses in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.
(Begin optional trim) Human Rights First, a New York based group, said more than 30 detainees have died in U.S. custody in Iraq and Afghanistan, although not all under the control of intelligence officers or as a result of interrogation.
"Nobody condones or excuses what happened at Abu Ghraib," Rice said.
"The problem of how to deal with unlawful combatants, though, in a different kind of war, is frankly a very difficult problem."
Rice appears to have had little input on U.S. torture policies.
Moreover, according to Kenneth Roth, executive director of the New York based Human Rights Watch, it was Rice who in 2003 pushed the Pentagon's general counsel to reaffirm its ban not only on torture but also on cruelty.
(End optional trim) Rice and Gonzales are expected to win Senate approval.
But the battle over what constitutes "cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment" and whether it is ever allowed will continue.
Conservative and liberal groups normally at each other's throats over the direction of government are finding common cause in wanting to gut major provisions of the U.S. government's premier anti terrorism law.
The American Civil Liberties Union, the American Conservative Union, Americans for Tax Reform and the Free Congress Foundation are among several groups that formed a coalition Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances to lobby Congress to repeal three key provisions of the USA Patriot Act. Having people from all sides of the political spectrum working together will keep politicians from calling Patriot Act opponents un American or willing to help terrorists, which happened during the original debate over the law, the groups said at a news conference Tuesday.
"We don't want this argument to be obscured by those who would suggest that anyone who is for more and more government power is somehow on the side of the right, and those who are against it or are skeptical of such grants are on the side of the wrong," said David Keene of the American Conservative Union.
"This is an important question of all Americans on the left, the right or in the middle."
For liberals, partnering with conservatives will ensure that the Republican dominated Congress and President George W. Bush's administration will have to listen to their concerns, said Laura W. Murphy, outgoing director of the ACLU's Washington legislative office.
The coalition wants Congress to repeal or let expire prosecutors' Patriot Act ability to easily obtain records in terrorism related cases from businesses and other entities, including libraries, the provision that allows "sneak and peek" searches conducted without a property owner's or resident's knowledge and with warrants delivered afterward, and what they called an overbroad definition of "terrorists" that could include non terrorism suspects.
The coalition highlighted the provisions in a letter to the president which also said, "We agree that much of the Patriot Act was necessary to provide law enforcement with the resources they need to defeat terrorism."
Justice Department spokeswoman Tasia Scolinos said the law "contains strong civil liberties safeguards and has a proven track record of being an effective tool in the war on terror.
"Any suggestion of civil liberties violations is an effort to shift the focus of the discussion away from the facts," Scolinos said.
"There have been no verified civil liberties violations filed against the Patriot Act.
Period."
Lawmakers set a 2006 expiration date on many of the wiretapping and surveillance measures, and will begin holding hearings starting in April on whether they should be renewed.
President Bush and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales have called for renewal of the Patriot Act, the government's post Sept 11, 2001, law that expanded its surveillance and prosecutorial powers against suspected terrorists, their associates and financiers.
Administration officials have said the Patriot Act has kept America safe, but opponents have called the law intrusive and contend that it undermines civil liberties and threatens to let the government snoop into the lives of innocent Americans.
The coalition "is seeking modest changes to only a few extreme sections of the law," said former Republican lawmaker Bob Barr of Georgia, the coalition's chairman.
"These changes will secure the important powers of the law while placing reasonable limits on their use."
The White House's homeland security adviser asked attorneys Thursday to help foster an honest debate over whether to reauthorize controversial anti terror laws.
Fran Townsend said White House support for extending the entire USA Patriot Act, which expires at the end of the year, is "unequivocal."
That law, which was passed in the wake of the Sept 11 terror attacks, gives the government broad surveillance and law enforcement powers in terror cases.
"In the debate over the Patriot Act, we often hear about that delicate balance that we rightly must make between freedom and security," Townsend told the American Bar Association.
"I value that debate.
The president values that debate.
And it is important.
What is equally important is that we not permit this valuable tool to be caught up in unnecessary rhetoric."
"I encourage you to keep that debate honest," Townsend said.
",We really should try to divorce this from partisan politics."
Civil liberties groups and privacy advocates have lambasted the Patriot Act because they believe it undermines freedom.
Critics says among the law's more controversial powers is the FBI's ability to obtain library and bookstore records in terrorism cases, and so called "sneak and peek" search warrants in which agents need not immediately tell suspects their home or business had been searched.
Townsend said she said she recently asked an audience to indicate how many people were concerned about the "library records provision" in the act. "Probably 70 percent of hands went up," Townsend said.
"And people were really stunned that there is nowhere in the Patriot Act the mention of library records."
Section 215 of the Patriot Act does not specifically mention bookstores or libraries, but permits secret warrants for "books, records, papers, documents and other items" from businesses, hospitals or other organizations.
Congress has rejected attempts to bar the FBI from using Patriot Act authority to obtain library and bookstore records.
A senior Bush administration official defended the Patriot Act on Tuesday as a "smart, ordinary and constitutional" tool in fighting terrorism and rejected attacks on it as rash and misinformed.
The comments by James B. Comey Jr., the deputy attorney general, coming in a speech before the American Bar Association on the third anniversary of the passage of the Patriot Act, offered a preview of what is likely to be a fierce fight in Congress next year over the future of the law.
With key elements of the Patriot Act set to expire at the end of 2005, President Bush has urged Congress to renew the law as a valuable weapon in tracking terrorists.
But liberals and some conservatives in Congress have repeatedly raised concerns about whether the law has given the federal government too much power and have urged a go slow approach in considering whether it should be renewed in its entirety.
In the face of frequent attacks on the law, Bush administration officials have mounted an increasingly aggressive and public defense of the legislation and railed against what they regard as distortions about what it does.
Comey's speech came on the same day that Attorney General John Ashcroft, in an op ed piece in The Wall Street Journal, called the Patriot Act "an indispensable tool" in fighting terrorism and said it "is often portrayed in an outright false light."
Critics challenged the Justice Department's aggressive defense of the law.
"It's ironic that the same Department of Justice that has misled the public about the Patriot Act would complain that the public has been misled," said Gregory Nojeim, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Washington legislative office.
Comey's own defense of the Patriot Act was significant both because of his current position as the second ranking official at the Justice Department and because of his prospects for a promotion.
Many officials inside and out of the Justice Department say they do not expect Ashcroft to return for a second term as attorney general if Bush is re elected, and Comey is thought to be on the short list of possible successors.
In his speech to the bar association, Comey defended two aspects of the Patriot Act that he said have come under unfair attack: a provision that allows authorities to conduct so called "sneak and peek" searches without immediately notifying the target, and a separate section allowing them to demand business records on terror and espionage suspects from bookstores, libraries and other institutions.
But civil liberties advocates, who have pushed for the repeal of secret intelligence warrants under the library records provision, argue that federal authorities can already use standard criminal warrants at libraries if they have evidence linking a suspect to terrorism.
President George W. Bush on Monday urged Congress to reauthorize the USA Patriot Act, the Justice Department's widely criticized anti terrorism law.
"We must not allow the passage of time or the illusion of safety to weaken our resolve in this new war" on terrorism, Bush said at a swearing in ceremony for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales at the Justice Department.
The president also argued that the Senate must give his nominees for the federal bench up or down votes without delay to fill vacancies in the courts.
The Patriot Act, passed in the wake of the Sept 11 terrorist attacks, bolstered FBI surveillance and law enforcement powers in terror cases, increased use of material witness warrants to hold suspects incommunicado for months, and allowed secret proceedings in immigration cases.
Civil liberties groups and privacy advocates lambasted the law because they said it undermines freedom.
But Bush said the act "has been vital to our success in tracking terrorists and disrupting their plans."
He noted that many key elements of the law are set to expire at the end of the year and said Congress must act quickly to renew it.
The Patriot Act was pushed by Gonzales' predecessor, John Ashcroft, who was in the audience as Gonzales took his oath from Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
Bush lauded Ashcroft's tireless efforts to make America safer as he oversaw a drop in violent crime besides his counterterrorism work.
Gonzales, who served as White House counsel during the last four years, said he would be a part of Bush's team but his first allegiance will be to the Constitution.
"I am confident that in the days and years ahead we in the department will work together tirelessly to address terrorism and other threats to our nation and to confront injustice with integrity and devotion to our highest ideals," Gonzales said.
President Bush on Monday urged the nation to stay the course in its "urgent mission" to fight terrorism, and he called on Congress to move quickly to extend sweeping law enforcement powers under the USA Patriot Act. "We must not allow the passage of time or the illusion of safety to weaken our resolve in this new war," Bush said in a speech at the Justice Department.
"To protect the American people, Congress must promptly renew all provisions of the Patriot Act this year."
The president's remarks came at the formal swearing in of his friend and longtime adviser, Alberto R. Gonzales, as the nation's 80th attorney general.
Gonzales won Senate confirmation 11 days ago by a vote of 60 to 36 after a sharp debate that focused on the administration's terrorism policies and their impact on the treatment of prisoners Bush built his re election campaign last year around the assertion that he was the candidate best able to defend the country against another terrorist attack.
In taking on the subject of the Patriot Act once again, he showed no signs of backing away from that approach.
A number of measures in the act that expand the government's ability to conduct secret surveillance and use other law enforcement powers will expire at the end of the year unless Congress extends them.
Many Democrats and some Republicans have voiced skepticism or outright opposition to an extension, and some lawmakers have offered competing proposals that would restrict the ability of federal agents to demand records from libraries and use other powers granted by the act. Bush's renewed call for an extension met with skepticism from the American Civil Liberties Union, which called on "cooler heads" in Congress to scrutinize and fine tune the law to meet civil liberties concerns.
"The president and the attorney general must realize that security and liberty are not and cannot be mutually exclusive," the group said in a statement The White House, however, has signaled that it will veto any effort by Congress to rein in counterterrorism powers.
Bush, speaking at the Justice Department's Great Hall before an audience of visiting officials and Justice Department employees, said that Gonzales was joining them in "an urgent mission to protect the United States from another terrorist attack."
Gonzales echoed that theme, pledging that department employees would "work together tirelessly to address terrorism and other threats to our nation, and to confront injustice with integrity and devotion to our highest ideals."
In the shaky, uncertain weeks after the Sept 11 attacks, Congress passed an anti terrorism bill that gave the government broad powers to peer into the lives of Americans.
It's time past time to rein in the excesses of the USA Patriot Act.
Last week, a federal judge in Manhattan struck down a provision in the 342 page act that enables federal authorities without court review to force Internet service providers to turn over personal information about subscribers and their online activities.
The provision also bars the companies from disclosing that they've been subpoenaed via a pre Patriot Act instrument known as a "national security letter."
U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero ruled that the provision violates the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and the First Amendment protections against prior restraint on speech.
The challenge was raised by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of an unnamed Internet service provider.
Attorney General John Ashcroft said the Justice Department would appeal the ruling.
"We believe the act to be completely consistent with the United States Constitution," he told The Associated Press.
Judge Marrero drew a far different conclusion, saying the provision and the latitude it gives the government to conduct unchecked searches have "no place in an open society."
For the long term health of our nation, it's essential to strike a more sensitive balance between the pursuit of security and the preservation of our basic freedoms.
As the judge points out, "Sometimes a right, once extinguished, may be gone for good."
Attorney General John Ashcroft did not violate anti lobbying laws when he gave a series of speeches last year promoting the anti terror Patriot Act, Justice Department internal investigators have concluded.
The agency's inspector general, Glenn A. Fine, said the trips to 16 cities in August and September of 2003 did not run afoul of laws barring executive branch officials from engaging in grass roots lobbying or prohibiting the spending of government money on unauthorized "publicity or propaganda."
"Neither the Anti Lobbying Act nor the appropriations provision prohibited the attorney general and the U.S. attorneys from making public speeches conveying DOJ's view regarding the merits of the Patriot Act and discussing the DOJ's use of the law's provisions," Fine said.
The inspector general's conclusions were in a letter to Rep John Conyers of Michigan, senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.
The letter, dated Friday, was obtained Monday by The Associated Press.
Conyers, who could not be reached immediately for comment, had asked Fine to investigate after a Government Accountability Office report showed that Ashcroft's tour and a pro Patriot Act Internet site had cost more than $208000 and also had involved activities by 80 of the 93 U.S. attorneys.
In his letter, Fine said that the attorney general and U.S. attorneys, as presidential appointees, are exempt from prohibitions against executive branch lobbying of Congress.
He also noted that a review of Ashcroft's speeches found he never urged audience members to contact members of Congress on behalf of the Patriot Act. "In addition, given the DOJ's responsibility to enforce criminal laws, we do not believe they could be considered 'purely partisan,'" Fine wrote.
The Patriot Act, passed by Congress a few weeks after the Sept 11, 2001, terror attacks, gave federal law enforcement officials broader powers of surveillance and prosecution against suspected terrorists, their financiers and their sympathizers.
Congress next year must decide whether to renew major parts of the law.
Washington An unusual left right coalition opened a campaign Tuesday to sharply curtail controversial provisions of the USA Patriot Act, showing that Congress and President Bush face a pointed debate over renewing the law enacted just 45 days after the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
It was a Washington rarity to see the American Civil Liberties Union line up with conservative lions like David Keefe of the American Conservative Union and former Rep Bob Barr, R Ga.
But they were among those at a Washington press conference held to assail such Patriot Act provisions as those allowing law enforcement agents to look at library users' records or to conduct unannounced "sneak and peek" searches on homes or private offices.
"It is not, and never should be necessary, to surrender our rights under the Bill of Rights to fight the war on terrorism," said Barr, who as a House member voted for the Patriot Act, which passed overwhelmingly in the House and provoked only one dissenting Senate vote.
Barr, leader of the new group dubbed Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances, concedes that the group faces a difficult fight in making changes to the 4 year old law.
The law's supporters, many of whom point out that the United States hasn't been hit by another terrorist attack since Sept 11, say it has proven effective and that many of the complaints offered by civil libertarians have nothing to do with the act's provisions.
Key provisions of the bill are scheduled to expire Dec 31, so Congress must deal with the issue this year.
The Senate and House Judiciary Committees plan Patriot Act hearings starting later in the spring.
Instead of seeking wholesale changes, the coalition is focusing on three of the law's most controversial provisions.
And rather than push for their repeal, the group wants the wording clarified to establish that the intention is to fight terrorists not let law enforcement agencies engage in fishing expeditions or silence dissent.
The group wants the section giving access to library, medical and firearm ownership records modified to require that law enforcement officials present evidence to a federal judge supporting a link with suspected terrorism before warrants are served.
The group wants similar limits on the provision allowing secret searches of homes, businesses and personal property.
And group members want the language of the section that allows surveillance of protests rewritten to require a definite connection with suspected terrorism.
"These provisions sweep far too broadly.
Whenever people ram through legislation with broad and vague authority, it eventually will be abused," Barr said.
"If the Constitution stands for anything, it's that government does not have the power to peer into our private lives without evidence of wrongdoing," said Laura Murphy, of the ACLU's Washington legislative office.
Grover Norquist, the conservative activist who heads Americans for Tax Reform, noted the unlikely coalition of conservatives and the ACLU. "For too long, conservatives assumed it was someone else's job" to protect civil liberties, Norquist said.
So far, almost 400 local and state governments have passed resolutions opposing the act, or some of its provisions, the ACLU says.
President Bush campaigned last year in favor of renewing the Patriot Act, and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has indicated he doesn't favor any changes except, perhaps, to increase the government's powers in a few instances.
"Debate about government exercise of powers that might infringe upon privacy or civil liberties, I think that's an appropriate debate," he told a recent meeting of the National Association of Counties.
"But it's got to be a real debate, one based on facts.
And I've yet to hear a strong argument as to why the Patriot Act should not be reauthorized."
At a recent House hearing, FBI Director Robert Mueller praised the Patriot Act and said he'd like to see it expanded to include administrative subpoena power in terrorism cases, something the FBI has in organized crime and health care fraud investigations.
The subpoenas, which require recipients to disclose information, are signed by an FBI agent without prior judicial or grand jury review.
Mueller said the Patriot Act is a key part of the FBI's new post Sept 11 approach.
"We have changed the way we address terrorism since Sept 11 to ensure that we have exploited every possibility to gather intelligence about the motivations, the capabilities of these individuals or groups in our communities before we go ahead and make the arrest," he told a House panel.
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT: Top issues for the U.S. Justice Department in President George W. Bush's second term include persuading Congress to renew key parts of the anti terrorism Patriot Act and continuing reform of FBI intelligence gathering.
THE OTHER SIDE: Opponents call the Patriot Act's expanded surveillance powers too intrusive and say it was rushed into law after the Sept 11, 2001, attacks without thorough review in Congress.
OTHER ISSUES: A legal question to be resolved: Can suspected terrorists be tried in civilian federal courts without jeopardizing national security or military missions?
Conservative libertarians launched a campaign Tuesday to persuade President Bush and Congress to fix the sections of the anti terrorism Patriot Act that they say intrude on privacy and harm civil liberties.
Long wary of the act's enhanced police powers, the conservatives announced they had formed the organization Patriots for Checks and Balances with the liberal American Civil Liberties Union in time for hearings in the Republican controlled Congress next month on whether it should renew 16 Patriot Act provisions that expire at year's end.
At a news conference Tuesday, ACLU Washington director Laura Murphy underscored the importance of raising the profile in the debate of such prominent conservatives as Grover Norquist of Taxpayers United, David Keene of the American Conservative Union and Paul Weyrich of the Free Congress Foundation.
"Given the number of folks in this room wearing elephant lapel pins, I don't think the administration can easily discount our message," said Murphy, referring to the symbol of the Republican Party.
Bush and new Attorney General Alberto Gonzales have said in recent speeches that one of their priorities this year is to win congressional renewal of all expiring sections of the controversial anti terrorism law, enacted just weeks after the Sept 11, 2001 terror attacks.
Bob Barr, the group's chair and a former Republican representative from Georgia who voted for the act in 2001, said the sunsetting of the provisions and the hearings in the House and Senate provide a "unique opportunity" to add checks and balances to the act.
In a letter sent to the president Tuesday, Barr and his group asked Bush "to reconsider your unqualified support" for three specific provisions, only one of which is set to expire without reauthorization.
Those are the so called "sneak and peek" Section 213, which allows agents to enter a place without first notifying the owner, Section 215, which permits agents to get business and library records more easily, and Section 802, which broadly defines terrorists and terrorism.
Barr and his group said that they find hope in Gonzales' remarks that he will be more open to discussion that his predecessor, John Ashcroft, who not only staunchly defended the act but sought to expand it.
Justice Department spokeswoman Tasia Scolinos said her agency "has spearheaded the call for active discussion and meaningful dialogue on the reauthorization of the Patriot Act." The ACLU has worked with conservative libertarians for the past decade with to insist on the inclusion of judicial review and other safeguards for privacy in anti terrorism laws.
Last year, the ACLU paid Barr $150000 to be a consultant and lobbyist, Senate records show.
Barr says he also consults for the American Conservative Union.
WASHINGTON Justice Department investigators nearly doubled the rate at which they used a controversial new search and seizure power, allowed under the USA PATRIOT Act, during the past 22 months, according to data released by the Bush administration Monday on the eve of congressional testimony by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
Formally called delayed notification searches, the warrants are known as "sneak and peek" because they allow investigators to search a person's home or business and to seize property without disclosing for weeks or months that they were there.
Although investigators must convince a judge that there is a "reasonable suspicion" that the investigation would be harmed if the subject were notified, no judge has ever denied a request for those searches.
Although the warrants are codified in a law enacted to fight terrorism, they are not limited to terrorism investigations.
And, according to the Justice Department, investigators have increasingly resorted to the power since the Patriot Act became law shortly after the terrorist attacks of Sept 11, 2001.
The Justice Department said Monday that the power was a valuable law enforcement tool for a "wide spectrum of criminal investigations, including those involving terrorism and drugs."
But the American Civil Liberties Union said the release "confirms our worst fears" that the use of the law is expanding beyond terrorism investigations, and called for greater oversight.
The Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday intends to question Gonzales and FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III about how the Justice Department has been using its Patriot Act powers, setting the stage for a year of political debate over whether to make the Patriot Act permanent or to scale it back.
In May 2003, the Justice Department released its initial data on how often it had used the search power, covering Oct 26, 2001, to April 1, 2003.
During those roughly 17 months, it asked for and got sneak and peek warrants 47 times, or about 2.7 times a month.
According to data released MOnday, investigators sought the warrants 108 times in 22 months from April 1, 2003, to Jan 21, 2005, a rate of 4.9 times a month.
The Justice Department said in its statement that sneak and peek searches are a very small fraction of the total number of search warrants it uses in its investigations.
The searches allow agents to gather evidence against subjects without tipping them off that they are under scrutiny something that could prompt them to flee, destroy evidence, or menace a witness.
"The department estimates that court approved delayed notification warrants represent less than 0.2 percent of the search warrants utilized by law enforcement," the statement said.
The law also allows the clandestine seizure of property when a judge finds that it is "reasonably necessary."
The Justice Department said it has sought such authorization 45 times since the Patriot Act became law.
But the ACLU said the "highly intrusive" searches "are being used primarily outside of the terrorism arena.
Congress must insist on receiving more detailed information on each of these searches and why each was necessary."
Delayed notification search warrants are among the enhanced police powers included in the Patriot Act.
Although judges have had the authority to approve no notification warrants in certain criminal cases for decades, the power did not become codified until the Patriot Act.
The ACLU and other critics have called for greater checks on the power, including stricter standards for when and how a judge may authorize sneak and peek searches.
According to the Justice Department data, no judge has ever denied a law enforcement request for such search and seizure warrants.
Gonzales's and Mueller's testimony Tuesday before the committee will mark the start of the Bush administration's campaign to persuade Congress to make the entire Patriot Act permanent this year.
Several of its provisions are due to expire at the end of the year, although the sneak and peek" search is not one of them.
A coalition of liberal and conservative libertarians plan to call Tuesday for the passage of the "Safety and Freedom Enhanced Act," which would amend several of the Patriot Act's provisions to provide for greater safeguards and oversight on when and how the powers are used.
Arlen Specter, chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee and a Republican of Pennsylvania, said Monday that reauthorizing "certain key provisions" of the Patriot Act is necessary, but he left the door open to scaling it back, contending that he is "mindful of the strong criticism which is coming from both the right and left of the political spectrum."
Democratic Senate aides said Gonzales will also face questioning regarding FBI agents who allegedly witnessed "torture techniques" during interrogations of "enemy combatants" at the Guantanamo Bay Navy Base in 2002.
Critics of the USA Patriot Act called for the Senate to temper the anti terrorism law's provisions that let police conduct secret searches of people's homes or businesses, but defenders say since no abuses have been documented the law should be renewed.
The Bush administration wants Congress to make permanent all 15 provisions of the law that expire at the end of the year, some of which have aroused civil liberties concerns among liberals and conservatives.
The law's national standards for what are sometimes known as "sneak and peek" searches are permanent.
Sens Larry Craig, an Idaho Republican, and Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that while they cannot show any specific abuses, the anti terrorism law is written in a way that could allow abuses.
"Our law cannot be written for the best and the brightest.
They must also anticipate enforcement from the worst and the weakest," said Craig, who is pushing a bill with Durbin that would scale back some of the Patriot Act's powers.
Critics of the law want Congress to pass the SAFE Act to limit the Patriot Act in several ways, including requiring government officials to inform suspects about the "sneak and peek" searches within seven days if a judge does not intervene.
The current law does not specify when the government has to inform suspects about the secret search.
"We do not want to end the Patriot Act.
We want to mend the Patriot Act," Durbin said.
Sen Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican, defended the anti terrorism law, saying that since no one can come up with specific abuses, the expiring provisions should be renewed.
"In this particular area because there has been no problems, it seems to be me that the assumption underlying the sunset provisions ought to move forward, which is, there being no problems, the act ought to be reauthorized," Kyl said.
The Justice Department has said that the courts authorized 155 delayed search warrants under the Patriot Act through January.
WASHINGTON Attorney General Alberto Gonzales signaled Tuesday that the Bush administration is open to compromise with civil liberties advocates on key provisions of the USA Patriot Act as it comes up for renewal this year, shifting away from the hard line stance of his predecessor, John Ashcroft.
Gonzales, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday, also revealed that the FBI had used Patriot Act surveillance powers to monitor an Oregon lawyer who last year was wrongly jailed for 14 days as a "material witness" in the March 2004 Madrid train bombings.
And Gonzales disclosed that FBI agents have used Patriot Act search warrants 35 times to obtain business records deemed relevant to a terrorism investigation.
In May 2004, Ashcroft publicly said such warrants had never been used.
None of those 35 warrants were used on libraries, but FBI Director Robert Mueller said some libraries have voluntarily provided information, such as data from computers used by a suspect for Internet access.
Librarian groups have been sharp critics of the Patriot Act, arguing that people's reading habits should be protected from government surveillance.
"As Congress considers whether to renew these provisions, I am open to suggestions for clarifying and strengthening the act," Gonzales said.
"I look forward to meeting with those both inside and outside of Congress who have expressed concerns about the act.
But let me be clear that I will not support any proposal that would undermine our ability to combat terrorism effectively."
During his tenure, Ashcroft threatened that President Bush would use his first veto if Congress modified the Patriot Act, and members from both parties criticized the former attorney general for failing to answer questions about how the Justice Department was using the law.
Gonzales' disclosures about how the Patriot Act has been used and his willingness to entertain revisions of the law were cheered by members of both parties.
"I am heartened by your opening statement, Attorney General, about being open to suggestions and ideas," said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic whip.
"It is a grand departure from your predecessor, and I think it is the right spirit for us to address the Patriot Act." Congress passed the Patriot Act shortly after Sept 11, 2001.
Most of it is dedicated to sharing information between law enforcement and spy agencies.
But its provisions granting FBI agents greater power to search people's computers, telephones, and homes have become powerful symbols to civil libertarians.
Sixteen provisions of the Patriot Act are due to expire at the end of 2005, and Bush has said it is a priority for Congress to make them permanent.
Testimony by Gonzales and Mueller Tuesday opened a new season of political debate over the measure.
"In the United States, with our deep tradition for civil rights and constitutional law, that concern for security has to be balanced by due regard for civil rights," said Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
He added later, "This is a very knotty problem.
I think there has to be some give on some of these authorities."
Meanwhile, Senator Larry Craig, an Idaho Republican, and Durbin filed a bipartisan bill Tuesday that would provide more public notification and scrutiny of Justice Department actions under the Patriot Act.
Among other changes, their measure would require that most people be notified of secret search warrants against them within seven days of the search.
It also would make certain that nonviolent political protests are not covered by the act. "Clearly the civil liberties of this country are its strength," Craig said.
"Out of fear, we should not run from those principles, nor should we deny ourselves those rights and those protections."
Libertarians have also suggested carving out exceptions for libraries and bookstores from the "business records" that may be sought under the Patriot Act.
But Gonzales argued that the power should be preserved, even as he stressed that the warrants have so far been used only for driver's license, credit card, and telephone records, not reading lists.
"It should not be held against us that we've exercised, in my judgment, restraint," Gonzales said.
Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, expressed impatience with the arguments by librarians, cutting off Mueller when the FBI director was discussing how to balance security and the "sanctity" of libraries.
"A library doesn't have any sanctity," Sessions said, adding that librarians "think it's sanctified, I'll admit.
I just disagree that it deserves special protection."
Gonzales also argued against a proposal to raise the standard of proof before a judge may authorize a search of business records.
Nevertheless, the attorney general said he would be happy to discuss compromises.
He offered two proposals for clarifying business record search warrants, saying the law should make clear that they are for national security investigations only, and business owners are allowed to challenge the warrants in court.
Greg Nojeim, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the Justice Department has already conceded those restrictions in court cases.
But he called Gonzales' willingness to consider other modifications "a welcome and constructive change."
"We believe the changes that the attorney general mentioned today were conceded long ago and much more needs to be done to bring the Patriot Act in line with the Constitution," he said.

Los Angeles Times: Patriot Act Is Called Vital.
The Bush Administration launched its campaign to preserve and expand the USA Patriot Act, the much debated anti terrorism legislation enacted after Sept 11.
With five state legislatures in revolt against the Patriot Act, Congress begins reconsideration of the sweeping anti terrorism legislation Tuesday amid clamor for changes from the political right and left.
Last week, Montana joined four other states that have passed resolutions urging Congress to curb the new powers hastily granted to federal law enforcement agencies six weeks after the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
This latest resolution to restrict the Patriot Act "protects our states rights and is what true Republicans in every 'red state' should be doing," said Rick Maedje, a GOP member of the Montana House of Representatives.
However, similar measures urging restrictions on the Patriot Act have also passed in the 'blue states' of Vermont, Maine and Hawaii which tend to vote Democratic in national elections as well as in the 'red states' of Alaska and Montana.
A coalition to rein in the Patriot Act is headed by former Rep Bob Barr, a conservative Georgia Republican, and has members ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union on the ideological left to Americans For Tax Reform on the right.
"It's our number one legislative priority," Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU, said Monday.
Portions of the act will expire at the end of this year if Congress does not vote to renew them, as President Bush has requested.
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales will begin making the administration's case to Congress this week, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday and the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.
Hearings are likely to continue into the summer before any measures come up for a vote.
"I expect these national hearings to be very thorough and I'm certain there will be probing questions from senators on both sides of the aisle," said Sen Arlen Specter, R Pa., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
"There are few issues that are more important to this committee and the American people than protecting our citizen's precious civil rights and civil liberties while continuing the battle against terror," said Rep John Conyers, D Mich., the ranking minority member on the House committee.
The Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers of surveillance, investigation and prosecution to use against suspected terrorists and their enablers.
However, opponents said it has also been used to bypass the constitutional requirements for "probable cause" in issuing warrants in ordinary criminal investigations and in other manners unrelated to terrorism.
"Despite the secrecy that permeates the Patriot Act, it's clear that it has been abused and misused," said Romero in a letter sent Monday to Sen Dianne Feinstein, D Calif., a member of the Judiciary Committee.
"The government has committed these transgressions without apology or regret and has simultaneously sought to expand the powers granted under the Patriot Act." In the letter, the ACLU said the act had been used to carry out a secret search of the home of Brandon Mayfield, a Muslim attorney in Portland, Ore., who was wrongly suspected of complicity in the 2004 terrorist bombing of a train in Madrid, Spain.
The ACLU also charged abuse or misuse of the act in keeping Tariq Ramadan, a "widely respected Muslim scholar," from entering the United States and for prosecuting Sami al Hussayen, a Muslim student in Idaho, for posting Internet links to materials the Justice Department deemed "objectionable."
Sens Larry Craig, R Idaho, and Richard Durbin, D Ill., plan to introduce the "Safety and Freedom Enforcement" or SAFE Act on Tuesday, aimed at eliminating some of the Patriot Act provisions that opponents view as most extreme.
It would deal with the so called "sneak and peek" provision, which allows federal agents to secretly search people's homes and businesses without any deadline on giving notice that the intrusion had taken place.
The SAFE Act would also curb a part of the Patriot Act that allows federal agents to collect personal data on ordinary Americans such as their medical history, books they check out at the library and goods they purchase without evidence that the citizen is connected to terrorism.
And it modifies a section that opponents say defines "terrorism" too broadly, making law abiding critics of federal policy subject to investigation.
(Story can end here, Optional add follows) In addition to the five state legislatures, the ACLU said 375 county and city governments in 43 states have passed resolutions warning against threats that the Patriot Act could pose to civil liberties.
In a March 7 speech to county officials, Gonzales contended that some of these votes were based on "misinformation or a lack of information."
"The act has helped us considerably in the war on terrorism," Gonzales said.
Romero said the ACLU has never opposed the Patriot Act in its entirety.
Some provisions were needed to fight terrorism, he said, "but some provisions went too far."

PRUNING THE PATRIOT ACTCONGRESS APPROVED the USA Patriot Act in a flush of fear following the Sept 11 attacks in 2001, but it had the good sense to put a time limit on many of the most controversial sections so they expire next Dec 31.
It ought to assess their effectiveness and potential for abuse rather than toughening the act, as one influential senator proposes.
Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, wants to expand the ability of the FBI to use search warrants issued by a secret intelligence court.
Under Roberts's plan, the agents could use this authority to look for evidence of crimes unrelated to the purpose of the warrants.
Roberts would also allow FBI agents to write their own subpoenas without having to get permission from a judge.
And the FBI would be able to order the US Postal Service to provide copies of envelopes addressed to or sent from people linked to national security investigations.
Neither Roberts nor the FBI has yet made the case that these powers are essential to thwart terrorism.
The senator's attempt to attach them to renewal of the Patriot Act has diverted attention from more pressing matters, such as whether this sprawling piece of legislation has been effective and whether it infringes on Americans' liberties.
In "Rethinking the Patriot Act," a study to be released this week by the Century Foundation in New York, legal scholar Stephen J. Schulhofer concludes that while some sections of the law are useful, its implications for civil liberties are troubling and its impact on terrorism is unclear.
Schulhofer joins many librarians who worry that enhanced search powers for documents allows government agents to rummage through Americans' private records, including the books they borrow.
No doubt most federal agents will use common sense when seeking this information, but the risk of abuse is still too high for this section to remain in effect.
Roberts's committee, which was drafting its version of a Patriot Act extension yesterday, will not have the last word on revising the law, the House has yet to prepare its own proposal.
Congress ought to be pruning unnecessary, intrusive sections instead of adding more threats to personal liberty.
Congress passed the Patriot Act in a climate of understandable urgency.
Schulhofer concludes that "legal limitations bear little if any of the blame for Sept 11."
With the advantage of hindsight and with adequate time to deliberate, Congress has an important chance to get it right this year.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, April 10: When Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who is not exactly a renowned civil libertarian, says the Patriot Act may need some adjustments, it clearly has serious problems.
The act, which was rushed through Congress after the Sept 11 attacks, gives government too much power to invade the privacy of ordinary Americans and otherwise trample on their rights.
Congress, which is now reviewing the act, should rewrite the parts that violate civil liberties.
But it is important to realize that most of the worst post Sept 11 abuses did not stem from the Patriot Act.
If Congress wants to restore the civil liberties Americans have lost in the last three and a half years, it must also look more broadly at the problems that have emerged from the war on terror.
After Sept 11, Congress was in such a rush to pass the Patriot Act that, disturbingly, many members did not even read it before they voted for it.
Fortunately, Congress made some of the most controversial provisions expire by the end of 2005.
Last week, it began a series of hearings on the act, focusing on the parts that need to be reauthorized.
The debate over the Patriot Act is too often conducted in bumper stickers, in part because the details are so arcane.
Parts of the law are reasonable law enforcement measures that have generated little controversy.
But other parts unquestionably go too far, and invite the FBI, the CIA and the White House to spy on Americans, and suppress political dissent, in unacceptable ways.
Libraries and Medical Records Section 215, often called the "library provision," is one of the most criticized parts of the act, with good reason.
It allows the government to demand library, medical, and other records, and makes it a crime for the record holders to reveal that the request was made.
Section 215 is written far too broadly.
It lets the government seize an entire database all the medical records of a hospital, all of the files of an immigration group when it is investigating a single person.
It also is far too invasive, it is hard to believe the FBI needs to monitor library book circulation.
If the searches are allowed, Section 215 should be tightened to give the government access only to records of a specific person it has legitimate reason to believe is involved in terrorism, not an entire database.
The "gag rule" that makes it illegal for the record holder to talk publicly about the search also is disturbing, because it prevents the public from knowing if the government is abusing these sweeping powers.
If the gag rule remains, it should be limited, so record holders can speak about the search after a suitable period of time, or talk about it right away without revealing who the target was.
Secret Searches Section 213, the "sneak and peek" provision, lets the government search a person's home and delay telling him about it.
These delayed notification searches fly in the face of the strong American tradition that the government must announce when it is entering a home.
Delayed notification searches were of questionable legality before the Patriot Act, and Section 213 which does not expire this year, but is still generating considerable debate clearly goes too far.
At the very least, it should apply only to terrorism cases, and not, as it now does, to all investigations.
It should also have clear guidelines for how long notice can be delayed.
Secret searches are an area where focusing only on the Patriot Act misses the larger picture of civil liberties violations.
There is another law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, that allows a worse kind of secret search one in which, unlike the delayed notification of Section 213, the subject may never be told about the search at all.
One way for Congress to deal with searches under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act as well as those under sections 213 and 215 of the Patriot Act is to monitor them closely, which is not being done now.
Congressional staff members with appropriate security clearance should review all requests for warrants or subpoenas, and should follow up on the results of the searches.
If the FBI, CIA or other units of government are using these tools to spy on Americans without sufficient justification, Congress needs this information to rein them in.
INFORMATION SHARING: Giving different units of government more power to share information about suspected terrorists is a laudable goal, but the Patriot Act's approach is flawed.
It authorizes the FBI, the CIA, and even the White House sweeping access to confidential information gathered about Americans, including telephone and e mail intercepts.
The access is not limited to officials working on terrorism.
And it sweeps in information, like confidential material acquired by grand juries, that has always been closely guarded.
There is a real danger that the new regime established by the act could produce a massive database on Americans, freely available to all units of government.
The Patriot Act makes the same mistake the FBI and CIA have long made: favoring information quantity over quality.
The universe of data that is shared should be narrowed, to focus on information closely related to suspected terrorism, and rather than being indiscriminately dumped, it should be given only to officials, at whatever agency, engaged in investigating terrorism.
In the case of data collected subject to the special powers of a court, such as wiretaps and secret grand jury material, a judge's approval should be required before it is simply dumped into a general database.
BEYOND THE PATRIOT ACT: At last week's hearings, Gonzales conceded that the Patriot Act may need some adjustment, while the Justice Department is largely standing by the law, and the FBI is even seeking to expand it.
But a coalition of Republicans and Democrats in Congress, backed by such unlikely allies as the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Conservative Union, is pushing for changes.
In the coming weeks, there will be more hearings on how the act can be improved.
These hearings should look beyond the Patriot Act, to the larger picture of civil liberties and the war on terror.
After Sept 11, the government rounded up illegal immigrants, and put hundreds with no ties to terrorism behind bars for months, often in deplorable conditions.
The Justice Department's own inspector general found that the government made "little attempt" to distinguish people with ties to terrorism from those without.
In conducting this roundup, the Bush administration gave itself far more power than the Patriot Act does.
Under the act, aliens are to be held no more than seven days before immigration or criminal charges are brought.
Nor did the Bush administration rely on the Patriot Act for its lawless "enemy combatant" doctrine, the basis for holding American citizens suspected of terrorism indefinitely, without access to family members or lawyers.
And the administration now claims that the CIA has the right to secretly transfer suspected terrorists to foreign countries for interrogation.
Critics of the process, known as rendition, say it is being used to subject these suspects to torture.
The authority for rendition comes not from the Patriot Act, but from a classified directive that President Bush signed shortly after 9/11.
If Congress becomes too bogged down in the minutiae of the Patriot Act in coming weeks, it will be in danger of missing the larger picture.
Revising the law should be the start, not the end, of its work.
When Congress enacted the Patriot Act after the Sept 11 attacks, it put the Justice Department on a short leash, mandating that many of the new powers in the act would last only four years unless renewed by Congress.
Now, as lawmakers are debating an administration proposal to make those provisions permanent, Republicans and Democrats are wondering whether they should retain the "sunset" provisions to ensure a degree of Justice Department accountability.
The issue is apt to become an important part of the debate as Cong Congress every couple of years and justify the provisions," a spokesman said.
"There seems to be strong bipartisan support for keeping sunsets in the Patriot Act, even after Congress decides what parts will be reauthorized and what parts will be amended," said Gregory Nojeim, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union legislative office.
"It appears that members believe that the sunset helps encourage the Department of Justice to be more forthcoming with information about how the Patriot Act is being used," he added.
Indeed, the uncertain fate of the law has resulted in a burst of detailed new information from the Justice Department about how it has been used.
At a Senate hearing Tuesday, Gonzales released declassified information showing how often the department had used powerful new tools under the law.
These included provisions covering the collection of a wide range of business records, and search warrants that allow the government to delay notifying the target of a warrant until sometimes weeks or months after the search has taken place, a practice critics call "sneak and peek."
The department also gave Congress a 69 page analysis of how the expiring provisions have operated, "I think it's a strong record of success.
I think that the act has been effective.
I think that the department has acted responsibly," Gonzales said.
WASHINGTON The Senate Intelligence Committee will meet behind closed doors this week to consider legislation that could dramatically expand the government's police powers under the USA Patriot Act, including a little discussed provision to enlarge the FBI's ability to wiretap people who it suspects are national security threats.
The proposal, in a draft bill sponsored by committee chairman Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, would lift one of the last restrictions on special warrants the FBI can obtain through a secret court originally set up to monitor foreign spies: that the information the bureau wants must be related to international terrorism or foreign intelligence.
Instead, the FBI could use the warrants, which bypass normal constitutional safeguards, to look for evidence of unrelated crimes that it could use to get suspects off the street.
The wiretap provision is one of three major additions in the draft bill, which would reauthorize the Patriot Act, the package of enhanced law enforcement powers enacted after the attacks of Sept 11, 2001.
If the bill became law, it also would give FBI agents the power to write their own subpoenas without permission from a judge, allowing them to seize records from hotels, banks, and Internet service providers.
This provision would require the FBI to make periodic reports to Congress about how often it uses that power to obtain library records, bookstore and firearms sales receipts, and medical or tax records.
The bureau also would have the authority to order the US Postal Service to make and turn over photocopies of envelopes addressed to or sent from people who have some connection to ongoing national security investigations.
And the bill would extend the deadline before the FBI is required to ask a judge to extend or renew a wiretap.
The draft bill Roberts has sponsored would escalate the government agents' police powers at a time when civil libertarians have been trying to roll back the Patriot Act by urging greater oversight of investigations by courts and Congress.
The Intelligence Committee bill doesn't include the new safeguards that critics, including both Democrats and Republicans, have proposed.
Lisa Graves, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, called the proposed bill a strategic maneuver by Republicans to shift arguments from curbing the Patriot Act to expanding it.
"It's an attempt to force the debate onto their terms, versus where the momentum has been headed, which is to roll back the Patriot Act to bring it in line with the Constitution and make sure its tools are focused on terrorists, as opposed to Americans," Graves said.
The draft of Roberts's proposal is still largely under wraps, and no one at the Justice Department nor the Intelligence Committee was available to comment on it late last week.
It was given to a small group of specialists who testified at the only public hearing in the Intelligence Committee in late May.
At that little noticed hearing, the FBI's general counsel, Valerie Caproni, testified that the Justice Department strongly supported Roberts' bill.
"Many of the most important provisions of the USA Patriot Act ,are scheduled to sunset at the end of this year, and the Justice Department therefore applauds this committee for taking up legislation that would make permanent those provisions," she said, according to her prepared opening statement at the hearing.
"We are also heartened that this committee has come forward with novel and worthwhile ideas for strengthening the department's counterterrorism capabilities."
Two of the new powers the Intelligence Committee would give to the FBI bear a strong resemblance to tools the bureau has long coveted, but which federal judges in the past have rejected.
In 2002, the Bush administration argued that, under the original language of the Patriot Act, it should be able to use the national security warrants from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to look for evidence of ordinary crimes as a way to keep suspected terrorists off the streets the same idea contained in the Roberts bill.
It was rejected by a special review panel for the secret court.
"We see not the slightest indication that Congress meant to give that power to the Executive Branch," wrote the panel, made up of federal appeals court judges.
The national security warrant process, they declared, "cannot be used as a device to investigate wholly unrelated crimes."
The possibility that the FBI could get such powers under a renewed Patriot Act has alarmed civil libertarians.
"From a constitutional standpoint, that would be devastating because it would essentially render the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizure completely meaningless," said former US Representative Bob Barr, the Georgia Republican who became a civil liberties specialist for the American Conservative Union, the nation's oldest conservative lobbying organization, after leaving Congress in 2003.
Although the powers sought by the FBI in the Roberts bill are significant, neither Roberts nor the Bush administration has made a strong effort to build a public case for why the bureau needs them before the bill is finalized.
Attempts to get a comment from Roberts's spokesman on the Intelligence Committee or from the Justice Department, which supervises the FBI, were unsuccessful.
Members of the committee staff and representatives of the Justice Department said that the two people who are authorized to talk about the Patriot Act were both away, and that no one else could comment.
The FBI was rejected in a prior attempt to write its own subpoenas for records from businesses if agents determined that the records were "relevant" to a national security investigation considered a very low standard to meet.
Last fall, judges stripped the bureau of that power, declaring it unconstitutional.
Laws dating back to 1986 had granted the bureau the power to write its own subpoenas to get telephone and Internet records for national security investigations of foreign agents.
Business owners served with those FBI demand letters were permanently gagged from telling anyone about the incident, including their clients and their own lawyers.
In 2001, the Patriot Act removed a key requirement.
Now, the subject only has to be "relevant" to investigations of suspected terrorists or foreign spies, a significantly broader standard.
After FBI agents used the power to demand unspecified customer service records from an Internet service provider, the company challenged the bureau in court instead of complying.
In September 2004, a judge ruled that power unconstitutional, saying that it violated both free speech and unreasonable search protections.
That case is still under appeal, but the draft bill would restore the power and expand it to any kind of records, papers, or other "tangible things" about a target which are held by a third party, with new procedures intended to address the constitutional issues.
Civil libertarians argue that the FBI has not clearly shown how its investigations have been hampered for lack of this power.
And they warn that unlike the Internet service provider who took the bureau to court few business owners will assume the expense of fighting such a subpoena, even if it is unreasonable, since their own privacy is not at stake.
Moreover, the Roberts provisions would surpass what is already one of the most controversial parts of the original Patriot Act: a section that allows the FBI to get warrants for customer records from the secret court, which was created in 1978 by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
This provision has been attacked by a range of critics, including librarians, who fear it will be used to obtain reading lists of their patrons.
The Bush administration has said it has never used this power against libraries.
At a time when critics of the Patriot Act want to curtail this power, the Intelligence Committee proposal would eliminate its final check lifting the requirement that the FBI get permission from the secret court before seizing the records.
"The administrative subpoena proposal is alarming because the Patriot Act version was already way broader than anything they needed," argued Stephen Schulhofer, a New York University law professor and author of a new book about the Patriot Act.
As Attorney General Alberto Gonzales prepares his defense of expiring provisions of the Patriot Act, the anti terrorism law's opponents hope to persuade Congress not to extend what they say are intrusions into Americans' lives.
Gonzales is to testify Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee and go before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.
FBI Director Robert Mueller, who also wants full reauthorization of the Patriot Act, will join Gonzales for his Senate appearance.
On the same day Gonzales will speak to the Senate committee, Sens Larry Craig, an Idaho Republican, and Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, plan to reintroduce legislation designed to curb major parts of the Patriot Act that they say went too far.
"Cooler heads can now see that the Patriot Act went too far, too fast and that it must be brought back in line with the Constitution," said Gregory Nojeim, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Washington legislative office.
The Patriot Act is the post Sept 11 law that expanded the government's surveillance and prosecutorial powers against suspected terrorists, their associates and financiers.
Most of the law is permanent, but 15 provisions will expire in December unless renewed by Congress.
Among them is a particularly controversial section permitting secret warrants for "books, records, papers, documents and other items" from businesses, hospitals and other organizations.
That section is known as the "library provision" by its critics.
While it does not specifically mention bookstores or libraries, critics say the government could use it to subpoena library and bookstore records and snoop into the reading habits of innocent Americans.
That criticism has led five states and 375 communities in 43 states to pass anti Patriot Act resolutions, the ACLU says.
Even some Republicans are concerned.
Senate Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, has suggested it should be tougher for federal officials to use that provision.
Does "this really incorporate the kind of constitutional guarantees that Americans have come to expect?" said David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union.
Gonzales already has agreed to two minor changes to the provision, and is expected to address those Tuesday, a Justice Department official said on condition of anonymity so as not to pre empt Gonzales' testimony.
He will support giving someone who receives a secret warrant under the provision the right to consult a lawyer and challenge the warrant in court, and will back slightly tightening the standard for issuing subpoenas, the official said.
Neither of the changes addresses the central concern of critics, which is that it allows the government to seize records of people who are not suspected terrorists or spies.
Gonzales and his predecessor, John Ashcroft, say the Patriot Act is a critical law enforcement tool that has helped protect the country from another terrorist attack.
However, Gonzales has shown a willingness to discuss possible modifications, saying in January he would consider Specter's suggestion to make it harder for officials to obtain warrants for books, records and other reading material.
"The attorney general has said before that if there are suggestions that can add to the government's ability to root out terrorists and aid us in the war on terror, he will certainly work with Congress to do that," Gonzales spokesman Kevin Madden said.
"He looks forward to a healthy discussion about those provisions."
But Gonzales wants the entire Patriot Act renewed and has spent significant time talking up the law in preparation for his possibly contentious appearances before Congress.
"I am willing to support improvements to our laws that make America safer.
What I will not support are changes in the law that would make America more vulnerable to terrorist attacks," he told a conference in February.
Critics say the law allows the government to target certain groups, but the Justice Department counters that no Patriot Act related civil rights abuses have been proven.
Just in case, Craig and Durbin plan to ask Congress Tuesday to curb both expiring and nonexpiring parts of the Patriot Act, including the expiring "library" provision and "sneak and peek" or delayed notification warrants.
Those warrants which will not expire in December allow federal officials to search suspects' homes without telling them until later.
The Justice Department said federal prosecutors have asked for 155 such warrants since 2001.
Gonzales also notes that the law has been used in non terrorism cases.
But non terrorism uses are part of what concerns Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.
"Many of us remember what happened with RICO," the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, Norquist said.
"It was originally passed and they were going to go after organized crime figures in dark shirts and they ended up using it against pro life demonstrators years later."
Crying, waving and throwing letters wrapped around stones to each other, hundreds of Kashmiris gathered on either side of a river that separates the disputed Himalayan region between Pakistan and India.
The emotional reunion Wednesday across the Neelum River came on the final day of the Islamic holiday of Eid al Fitr and as Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh paid a rare visit to Indian controlled Kashmir, his country's only Muslim majority state.
Families separated for decades by the Kashmir conflict shouted greetings over the noise of the fast flowing river.
Despite easing tensions between South Asia's nuclear rivals, Kashmiris are still forbidden from crossing the watery border.
Nosheen Akhtar, 22, and her mother, Khonshad Begum, 40, burst into tears, wailed and beat their chests unable to meet Begum's mother on the Indian side.
"I want to jump into the river.
My mother is there and I cannot go over to meet with her," said Begum, her relatives holding her back.
Authorities on both sides were restricting access to the riverside at Karin, 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan held Kashmir.
Indian soldiers were preventing people from getting too close, and on the Pakistan side, police said authorities had not given formal permission for the reunions.
The Pakistani and Indian portions of Kashmir are separated by a heavily militarized cease fire line where skirmishes were once common between their forces.
The guns have fallen silent for the past year amid the thaw in relations, and since then there have been several opportunities for family reunions albeit at a distance of 25 meters (yards) across the river.
Pakistan and India both claim Kashmir in its entirety and have fought two wars over it since their independence from British rule in 1947.
The conflict has only deepened since an Islamic insurgency began on the Indian side in 1989.
India accuses Pakistan of helping foment it, which Pakistan denies.
Some Kashmiris have fled from the Indian to the Pakistan side, accused of involvement with the rebels.
On Wednesday, Singh, the Indian leader, expressed a commitment to make peace with Pakistan, while Islamabad hailed India's withdrawal of some of India's troops in Kashmir a move hoped to spur the peace process.
But Kashmiris are impatient for progress that will allow them to reunite with relatives across the cease fire line, known as the Line of Control.
The two countries are due to start formal talks on Kashmir next month, and people on both sides are eager for a long standing proposal for a bus service between Muzaffarabad and Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian held Kashmir, to finally get off the ground.
"Both the countries have not been allowing us to meet," said Raja Azhar Khan, a 55 year old refugee, whose wife and son live on the Indian side of the Neelum River.
"The two countries are getting friendly.
They are allowing people to meet each other at Wagha (the main land border between Indian and Pakistan).
Why are we Kashmiris not being allowed to meet?"
Pakistan says it would not accept the existing military line dividing Kashmir as an international border, and is playing down concern that India is irreconcilibly opposed to adjusting that frontier.
During a rare visit to the Indian controlled portion of Kashmir, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh offered Wednesday to hold talks on Kashmir "with anyone and everyone," but ruled out any redrawing of the Himalayan territory's frontier.
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan said that Singh's comments did not necessarily represent an intractable position.
"Let us not read too much into these statements because, as you can see, we have this track of confidence building and dialogue, and there is no definitiveness in these statements," Khan told a news conference Thursday.
Singh's trip to Kashmir came as India began withdrawing some of its troops from the region, a goodwill gesture to war weary Kashmiris and Pakistan ahead of planned talks between the nuclear armed rivals on the problem due next month.
Kashmir is claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan, and the countries have fought two wars between over the territory since 1947.
The Indian and Pakistan controlled portions are separated by the so called Line of Control.
"Any solution based on the Line of Control will not be acceptable to Pakistan," Khan said.
"This is very clear.
We are asking for a solution that is acceptable to the people of Pakistan, India and the Kashmiris."
Pakistan and India began a peace process early this year, and are due to start formal talks on Kashmir next month.
In a shift in stance, Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf last month suggested that some areas of Kashmir be made independent, placed under joint Indian and Pakistani control, or put under United Nations administration.
The proposals have been greeted with little enthusiasm by India, although it has since announced its troop withdrawal.
On Thursday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Khursheed Kasuri advised India to avoid controversial statements, saying the relations between the two nations were at a "very delicate stage and required careful nurturing."
"The fact is that Jammu and Kashmir is a dispute which Pakistan and India have to resolve through dialogue and negotiations," he was quoted as saying by state run news agency the Associated Press of Pakistan.
Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz is due to make his first trip to India next week since taking office in August, and will hold talks with Singh.
Khan said the two prime ministers would discuss "all issues."
Pakistani and Indian officials will exchange passenger lists for a bus service next month across the divided Kashmir region, a Foreign Ministry official said Monday.
Pakistan and India agreed in February to re establish a bus link between the Indian and Pakistan controlled portions of Kashmir as part of moves to improve relations between the two longtime rivals.
The first buses between Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani Kashmir, and Srinagar, capital of Indian Kashmir, are scheduled to run on April 7 one bus with 30 passengers traveling in each direction.
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman Jalil Abbas Jilani said Pakistani and Indian officials will on Tuesday exchange lists of passengers for the first buses.
The passengers on the first bus route will include men and women, as well as elderly people who have not seen relatives on the other side of the frontier for 50 years, he said.
Indian and Pakistani military commanders were to discuss Wednesday Indian charges that Pakistan fired mortar shells across the border into Indian controlled Kashmir in violation of a 14 month ceasefire.
The director generals of military operations of the nuclear armed neighbours were slated to talk by telephone about the incident that occurred late Tuesday.
"The director generals of military operations will be talking later today," an Indian government official said, declining to be named.
"The Pakistani side has denied firing.
Let's see."
The time of the hotline call between the Indian and Pakistani officials was not immediately known.
On Wednesday, Islamabad denied it had violated the ceasefire in the disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir, spark of two of three wars between Indian and Pakistan, and over which they skirmished in 2002.
India and Pakistan began the ceasefire November 25, 2003, after routinely exchanging artillery fire across the volatile Line of Control, the de facto border separating their armies in Kashmir, as part of a tentative peace process.
"No one from Pakistan has fired and there is no ceasefire violation by Pakistan," Pakistan military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan told AFP in Islamabad.
The firing was front page news in Indian newspapers.
"Pakistan opens fire across Line of Control," said The Hindu.
Indian police said Tuesday at least one person was injured when about 15 mortars were fired into India from Pakistan over the Line of Control.
The mortars came from across the border Tuesday evening and landed in India's Durga Post area in the Poonch sector, an Indian police spokesman said.
Indian army officer Major General D. Samanwar told NDTV news channel the incident was tantamount to a ceasefire violation.
"Yes, it certainly is a violation.
It's the first time it has happened but we've exercised full restraint," he said, adding troops had been put on alert.
The two sides have been engaged in formal peace talks to normalise relations since January 2004.
Markets are overcrowded, traffic jam is heavy and the shops are jostling with shoppers in the capital city of Srinagar in the Indian administered Kashmir as the holy Moslem festival of Eid approaches here.
Kashmiris are known as incorrigible festive shoppers and because of that reputation, unscrupulous shopkeepers have been minting money by over charging the locals for everything from a chop of mutton to the chickens and hosiery items that the locals must buy to protect themselves from the biting cold of the winter.
But, around this Eid festival, there is more to the happy public mood than just the urge to over spend during the festival.
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who arrives here on a two day visit next week, announced on Thursday that orders had been given for the reduction of troops inside Kashmir.
This measure has obviously been taken to take care of the building tensions between the Indian army and local people who often come into unpleasant contact during encounters, crackdown operations and search and cordon exercises that have become so routine in Kashmir ever since the present armed struggle against the Indian rule started here 18 years back.
It must also be mentioned that the Indian army on Friday suspended and took into custody an officer who had been accused of having raped a woman and her daughter in a north Kashmir village last week.
It is, therefore, clear that the Prime Minister's decision has not been influenced by any dramatic improvement in the ground situation.
Coinciding with the announcement made in the Indian capital New Delhi, Indian paramilitary police was battling it out with two suicide guerrillas that forced entry into their camp in Srinagar' s Dalgate area on the banks of the Dal lake that is regarded as one of the most secured places in Kashmir and the hub of the tourist activity in Kashmir.
Interestingly, Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patil, who had recently visited Kashmir for three days, told reporters in Delhi that he was yet to submit his report to the Prime Minister about his perceptions of the ground situation in Kashmir.
Patil was obviously trying to suggest that the Prime Minister Singh had taken the decision to reduce the troops inside Kashmir on his own.
Kashmir is a very tricky situation.
One grenade blast can put things back by months here.
That is why the prime minister has said that together with the reduction in the number of troops in Kashmir, there would be no lowering of vigil.
This also is the reason that many locals believe the Indian government is acting under international pressure.
Interestingly, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf had recently put forth a new formula on Kashmir that was seen as a climb down from the previous Pakistan position on Kashmir.
Significantly, Musharraf had suggested withdrawal of Indian troops from Kashmir region.
Does this mean that both Musharraf and Singh are simply trying to play roles that have been scripted for them by the international community?
For most Kashmiris who have been fed up with the stiffening of Indian and Pakistan approaches on Kashmir, this appears to be the right argument.
And that has given them new hope to celebrate the forthcoming Eid with more joy and confidence.
It is possible the solution ahs already been drafted and both India and Pakistan are slowly but surely moving in that direction step by step so that the people of the two countries are not taken by surprise when the final agreement is signed, said Samad Sheikh, 71, a village headman in Kashmir.
For Kashmiris the recent developments and the fact that the bilateral ceasefire on the borders between the two countries was holding for the last one year are indications that their troubles might soon end.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met with Kashmiri political leaders on Thursday during a rare visit to the Himalayan region aimed at ending half a century of separatist violence that has claimed tens of thousands of lives.
Earlier, Singh offered to hold talks on Kashmir "with anyone and everyone" but ruled out any redrawing of the disputed territory's frontier, which separates Indian and Pakistan controlled portions of the region.
Singh on his first visit as prime minister to India's Jammu Kashmir state also announced a four year, multibillion dollar development plan he promised would result in thousands of jobs for people in the region.
Singh's two day trip came as India began withdrawing some of its troops on the border, a goodwill gesture to war weary Kashmiris and rival Pakistan.
On Thursday, Singh met with members of the state Cabinet to discuss ways to implement the economic aid package.
He was also scheduled to meet with army and paramilitary force commanders to review a decision to reduce troops deployed in India's Jammu Kashmir state.
Although Singh's visit was largely welcomed by Kashmiris, many were inconvenienced after security forces barricaded the main streets of Jammu, the state's winter capital, ahead of his arrival.
Children and office workers trudged to their schools and offices after public buses were halted as part of the stringent security measures in the city.
Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan but both claim the region in its entirety.
India accuses Pakistan of arming Muslim insurgents fighting for the region's independence or merger with Islamic Pakistan.
Islamabad denies that.
Talks with Kashmiri separatists began last year under Singh's predecessor, Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Singh indicated his government also would press to end tensions with Kashmiri militants and Pakistan.
But Singh shrugged off a suggestion by Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf last month that some areas of Kashmir be made independent, placed under joint Indian and Pakistani control, or put under United Nations administration.
"Any redrawing of the international borders is not something that is going to be acceptable to us," Singh said.
Singh also Wednesday addressed a rally of some 12000 people.
"I have come here with the realization and hope that I can understand what your aspirations and desires are," he said, barely visible as he spoke from behind a bulletproof screen.
India has cited a decline in separatist violence as the main reason for its troop withdrawal, which reportedly will be about 40000 of the half million stationed in Kashmir.
But a gunbattle launched by militants hours before Singh's visit underscored the fragile security of the region.
Two militants were killed and two soldiers and a civilian wounded in the attack near the rally site, security forces said.
Singh announced an economic development plan for Kashmir that would spend 71 billion rupees (US$1.5 billion, euro1.16 billion) next year, part of a 240 billion rupee (US$5.3 billion, euro4.1 billion) outlay over four years.
Some of the money will come from international financial institutions.
The funds would go to building new roads and schools, and developing infrastructure for water, power and health care.
The initiatives are expected to create 24000 new jobs, including 14000 for women.
Creating employment for young people in Jammu Kashmir was also a priority, Singh said, adding a ban on recruitment for government jobs will be lifted.
The countrywide ban on government hiring was part of measures to downsize India's bloated public sector.
"The ban will not apply to Jammu Kashmir since youth in the state are facing hardships in getting jobs," Singh told a crowd of about 15000 in Jammu.
The prime ministers of India and Pakistan plan to meet here Wednesday in an effort to find new grounds for compromise in the long running conflict over Kashmir.
Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz arrived here Tuesday on a tour of regional capitals as head of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, which promotes closer economic ties within the region.
Aziz has said he will use his visit with Indian leaders to seek progress in peace efforts that began last year.
Both countries have hinted that Aziz's meeting with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh may produce agreement on opening bus service between the Indian and Pakistani controlled sections of Kashmir for the first time in 57 years of conflict over the Himalayan territory.
The two countries also are said to be near a deal on a $4.2 billion pipeline to deliver natural gas from Iran to India through Pakistan.
Aziz's two day visit comes amid mixed signals from India and Pakistan on their willingness to compromise on Kashmir.
After insisting for months that they were ready to give up entrenched positions and make lasting peace, leaders of both countries in recent days have repeated hard line views on the disputed region.
Indian security forces said they were winning a war against the separatists in Kashmir, which began in 1989.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf insisted again last week that the guerrillas were freedom fighters acting without anything but moral support from his country.
The Indian military says so far this year it has blocked about 60 attempts by militants to infiltrate Indian held territory from the Pakistani side.
The number climbed in recent weeks as Musharraf pressed Singh to move more quickly on negotiations over Kashmir.
"Let me tell you that I have no reason to believe that there has been any lack of effort in infiltration attempts from across the border," India's chief of army staff, Gen. Nirmal Chander Vij, said Monday.
"During the current month alone, there have been eight such attempts, including two taking place during the last two to three days."
After the Sept 11 terrorist attacks, the United States pressured Pakistan to rein in the militant groups, several of which were allies of the al Qaida network.
But as the guerrillas lose their strength, Pakistan loses leverage on the Kashmir issue.
India tightened the noose around the insurgents by completing a 12 foot high fence this year that runs 340 miles along its international border with Pakistan and a 1972 cease fire line, or Line of Control, that divides the disputed region between the two.
(Begin optional trim) When the British pulled out of the subcontinent in August 1947, they told the Indian princes, including the Hindu maharajah who ruled the mainly Muslim territory of Jammu and Kashmir, to choose between joining India or Pakistan.
As the king delayed, the two neighboring nations went to war over the region in October of that year, and it has been divided since.
Within days of the war, the maharajah chose India, but Pakistan has long insisted that he did so under pressure and that the people of Kashmir should be allowed to decide their fate in a binding referendum promised in a 1948 United Nations Security Council resolution.
(End optional trim) Musharraf is the first Pakistani leader to publicly suggest that the dispute might be resolved without a vote by Kashmiris if India makes significant concessions.
But he also has suggested that India is hardening its position.
Last week, Musharraf revived Pakistan's demand for the plebiscite, in the face of New Delhi's continued claim that Kashmir was its territory and that India's boundaries could not be redrawn.
Pakistan will only drop its demand for a vote "if India is prepared to show flexibility," Musharraf told an interviewer last week, adding that "at the moment ,we don't see that."
The leader of moderate Kashmiri separatists warned Thursday that lasting peace between India and Pakistan would be impossible unless his people were seated at the negotiating table.
During more than a year of talks with Pakistan, India has refused to let Kashmiri leaders have a direct role in deciding possible solutions to the 57 year conflict over Kashmir.
Kashmiri leader Mirwaiz Omar Farooq insisted Thursday that "historic realities," such as a guerrilla war against Indian rule that began in 1989, meant three way talks were the only way to end the dispute over the divided territory.
"Kashmiris have expressed themselves in red hot blood for the last 15 years, and this reality cannot be ignored, neither by India nor Pakistan," said Farooq, who heads a loose alliance of separatist groups called the All Party Hurriyat Conference.
"So if anybody believes that you can have a bilateral agreement on Kashmir, they are highly mistaken."
The official death toll in the Kashmir insurgency is more than 45000, but Kashmiris say the real number is more than twice that.
Almost 1600 people have died in the conflict this year.
Indian authorities said about half the dead were militants, 456 were civilians and 269 were members of the security forces.
In January, former Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's government began the first talks with Kashmiri separatist leaders, but two rounds of discussions showed little progress.
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has been slow to resume negotiations with Kashmiri leaders since defeating Vajpayee in May elections.
Singh repeated here Wednesday that Kashmir is part of India and insisted any peace deal with Pakistan could not redraw international borders or divide Indian territory along religious lines.
Kashmiri leaders feared those were new condset out specific proposals for negotiation.
A third round of talks with India's government can't start until it agrees to let Kashmiri leaders visit Pakistan to discuss peace proposals with its government and guerrilla commanders in the part of Kashmir under Pakistan's control, Farooq said.
"Both things have to be addressed," he told reporters here, after insisting Hurriyat leaders were not setting conditions for resuming negotiations.
Farooq said Hurriyat leaders would travel to New Delhi next week to meet Pakistan's Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, who is expected to discuss new efforts to advance a peace process that began last year.
According to Farooq, Aziz plans to discuss recent proposals by President Pervez Musharraf for a settlement, which included granting autonomy to the divided region and putting parts of it under joint rule by India and Pakistan.
After hearing Kashmiri leaders' views, Aziz will formally present the proposals to India's government, said Farooq, who called Musharraf's suggestions "a step in the right direction."
"The Hurriyat has three road maps for resolving the Kashmir issue," Farooq said, without providing details.
"And we are ready to discuss all three, with both the Indian and Pakistan governments, so that a way forward can be charted that is acceptable to all."
CHAKOTHI, Pakistan Sixty year old Khalid Hussain hugged the brother in law he had only seen before in photos after traveling from Indian to Pakistani controlled Kashmir on the bus service revived between the divided region after a half century of conflict.
"We are so happy we can't express how we feel," Hussain said Thursday after crossing a narrow bridge over a rushing river that spans the military Line of Control that cleaves the disputed Himalayan region.
Minutes later he embraced his wife's brother, Asif Solaria, who lives on the Pakistan side and came to meet him.
Fifty seven years of conflict has divided thousands of Kashmiri families.
Some migrated in the aftermath of the bloody partition of the subcontinent in 1947, many more fled to the Pakistani side when a separatist insurgency took hold in the Indian portion of Kashmir in 1989.
Previously, the only way to reunite was through the long and difficult process of applying for a visa to the other country or, during lulls in the violence, by yelling greetings across the roar of the water at the riverine frontier when authorities permitted it.
All that changed Thursday, when two buses, carrying about 50 people in all, many of them elderly, shuttled in each direction between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad, the capitals of the Indian and Pakistan administered Kashmir, for 15 day stays.
It was an event treated with pomp on both sides and observed with glee by thousands of Kashmiri villagers scattered on the steep mountainsides of the Jehlum Valley despite storm clouds, rain and lightning.
Many more lined the road on both sides of the frontier.
The bus service heralded by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as a "a caravan of peace" will only run once every two weeks, but it's the most concrete sign that a yearlong peace process aimed at burying the historic enmity between the nuclear armed rival nations is bearing fruit for Kashmiris.
Until a year and a half ago, the two armies would routinely shell each other, often killing civilians who were displaced from their homes in their thousands by the conflict.
On Thursday, white flags fluttered at either side of the "peace bridge," its approaches recently cleared of land mines.
The peace process has also led to resumption of trains, buses and flights between India and Pakistan, but the launching of the bus link across Kashmir severed in 1948 is more resonant, holding out some hope of an end to the intractable conflict over the region, which is claimed by both countries in its entirety.
India has long accused Pakistan of fomenting a separatist insurgency in Kashmir that has left more than 66000 people dead over the past 15 years.
Pakistan says it gives political backing to the rebels but denies giving military support.
The bus service was launched despite an attack Wednesday in Srinagar by suspected militants on a government tourism complex where passengers were staying.
They traveled anyway the following day, apparently undeterred and making a small piece of history.
"I never thought I would see this day in my lifetime," said Zahir Uddin, 57, as he waited in Chakothi on the Pakistan side of the frontier for two uncles, both aged in their 80s, who took the bus from India.
"It's taken a long time.
It should have happened much sooner."
Raja Ferozuddin, 75, a retired government official from Muzaffarabad, was greeted in a village on the route to Srinagar by two of his Indian nephews after crossing from Pakistan.
The three kissed and wept with joy as they held each other.
"I was eight years old when I left this place," Ferozuddin said.
"All this has happened very late in my life.
I want to embrace all this into my heart the trees, the hills, the rocks."
Eds: Associated Press Writer Mujtaba Ali Ahmad in Salamabad, India, contributed to this report.
India's prime minister will personally flag off the first bus to travel between the Indian and Pakistan zones of divided Kashmir in almost six decades when the service resumes next month, an official said Saturday.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Kashmir in April will be his third since he assumed office in May.
"The prime minister will be in (the Indian Kashmir summer capital) Srinagar to flag off the first bus on April 7," Singh's spokesman said.
The bus service is the first tangible result of 14 months of dialogue between the nuclear armed neighbours who have fought three wars including two over Kashmir, which each hold in part but claim in full.
India and Pakistan agreed last month that Kashmiri residents would not need passports to cross the divided state by bus but would use permits issued by the civil administration after being cleared by police.
The bus service was suspended in 1947 after the first India Pakistan war over Kashmir.
The second was in 1965.
Indian Kashmir is in the grip of a 15 year old insurgency that has so far left thousands dead.
India blames Pakistan for fomenting the insurgency in Kashmir which has left at least 40000 dead according Indian estimates, though separatists put the toll at twice that number.
Pakistan denies supporting the rebels though it admits to extending moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiris' freedom struggle.
Indian authorities last week said some 150 permits had been issued to applicants from Indian Kashmir to travel by the bus linking Srinagar to Muzaffarabad, capital of the Pakistan administered zone.
Of the 150 applicants, 60 will be short listed for the first two trips the first on April 7 and the second a fortnight later an official said.
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has invited Kashmir's separatists for peace talks a move that could boost efforts to end India and Pakistan's decades old dispute over the Himalayan region.
Singh offered to hold talks on Sept 5 with the moderate faction of Kashmir's main separatist alliance, the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, the prime minister's spokesman, Sanjaya Baru, said Wednesday An agreement with the separatists is crucial to pushing forward the peace process between India and Pakistan.
Kashmir, the only Muslim majority state in predominantly Hindu India, is split between the two countries, but both claim all of it.
The talks come ahead of a planned meeting on Sept 14 between Singh and Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.
Despite improved relations in the last two years, India and Pakistan have made few moves toward resolving the dispute over Kashmir, which lies at the core of their rivalry and was the cause of two of three wars fought by the neighbors since their independence from Britain in 1947.
The leader of Hurriyat, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who will head the Kashmiri delegation, said the talks in New Delhi should help push Kashmir to the forefront of the Indian Pakistan peace process.
"The cycle will be complete now.
India is talking to Pakistan, Pakistan talks to us and we talk with India," he said.
Farooq was one of nine separatist leaders who traveled to Pakistan in June and met with Musharraf to discuss Kashmir.
There was no immediate reaction from Pakistan.
Kashmir is "a complicated issue, but it can be resolved if there is sincerity and commitment of all parties involved," he said.
"If we can build trust and confidence, the Kashmir dispute can be resolved."
In Washington, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the U.S. government welcomed discussions that would relieve tensions over Kashmir.
"We encourage those discussions and they're continuing to take steps that build up trust and confidence to address the differences they have on this issue," he told reporters.
India's previous government, led by Hindu nationalists, held two rounds of talks with the Kashmiris in 2004, although little progress was made before parliamentary elections later that year brought Singh's Congress party to power.
Since then, government officials have been in contact with Hurriyat leaders through mediators, Baru said.
During the 2004 talks, Hurriyat leaders demanded the government release some 500 activists held as political prisoners in Indian jails, and some have since been freed.
Farooq said he did not expect substantive discussions on Sept 5, when the exchanges would mostly be introductory.
Jammu Kashmir's elected head, Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, said he expects the meeting would pave the way for a wider dialogue that will be joined by hard liners, many of whom support a violent insurgency to wrest Kashmir from India.
They have so far ignored the government's call for talks.
Saifudin Soz, a Kashmiri lawmaker who is helping arrange the talks, said "an overwhelming majority of Kashmiris tired of violence will welcome the talks."
The Hurriyat has been demanding Kashmir's independence since the region was split months after India and Pakistan were partitioned into independent countries by the British.
The campaign turned violent in 1989, and there are now more than a dozen rebel groups fighting in India's portion of Kashmir.
The insurgency has killed more than 66000 people, most of them civilians.
Moderates, such as Hurriyat leader Farooq, have denounced the insurgency.
The moderate wing of Indian Kashmir's main separatist alliance said Monday it will meet Pakistan President Pervez Musharraff when he visits New Delhi this weekend, local media reported.
The All Party Hurriyat Confererence has been pushing for its inclusion in a formal peace proceess between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan aimed at ending the long festering dispute over the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir.
The Hurriyat said it would discuss Tuesday in Srinagar, the main city of Indian Kashmir, its strategy for the meeting with the Pakistani president, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.
Musharraf is coming to New Delhi to watch the final one day cricket match of a series between the two countries and meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to push forward the peace process.
"We will be meeting Musharraf on April 16.
This has been verbally communicated to us," the chairman of the moderate wing, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, told the Press Trust of India.
It gave no further details.
Both the moderate and hardline factions of Hurriyat have welcomed the peace process launched in January 2004 between the neighbours which have fought three wars, two over divided Kashmir that both claim in full.
But separatist leaders say at some point they must be included in the discussions on Kashmir's future in a "triangular dialogue."
India, however, wants a bilateral solution while Pakistan wants the separatists' involvement.
Indian security forces have been fighting since 1989 to suppress a deadly revolt against New Delhi's rule in Indian Kashmir.
The Pakistani president said on the weekend he was more interested in discussing the future of Kashmir with Indian leaders than being a spectator at the cricket game set for Sunday.
Musharraf's trip will just come just over a week after the launch of a historic bus service linking the Indian and Pakistan zones of Kashmir.
Musharraf has said the bus service cannot resolve the Kashmir issue but is a "step towards confidence building".
Meanwhile, The Hindu newspaper quoted Farooq as saying he wants to take the bus to meet Kashmiri leaders in Pakistan administered Kashmir.
"A sincere political dialogue should start now between the political leaders on both sides ,and a visit by Hurriyat leaders would go a long way in the convergence of ideas for an amicable solution," he said.
India invited Musharraf to attend one of the matches on Pakistan's first full tour of India in six years after the Pakistani leader said he wanted to watch a cricket match in India.
Musharraf's visit to India will be the first since a summit in the northern city of Agra in 2001 with then prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee collapsed over Kashmir dispute.
Pakistan and India were due to hold meetings of a long dormant joint economic body for the first time in 16 years Tuesday, marking a further thaw between the South Asian rivals, officials said.
Senior Indian diplomat Shyam Saran said the commission would discuss steps to promote trade ties between the nuclear armed neighbours, who have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir.
"This will be the first meeting of the joint commission after a gap of 16 years.
This is a very significant event for our two countries," Saran, the senior official in the Indian foreign ministry, told reporters late Monday.
"Our trade and economic relations are improving," he said, noting that Pakistan recently used their land border to import basic foods including onions, garlic and potatoes from India.
The decision on the economic commission was reached Monday during Indian Foreign Minister Natwar Singh's talks with his Pakistani counterpart Khurshid Kasuri to review progress on the peace process between the two countries.
India and Pakistan also signed deals under which they agreed to notify each other in advance on ballistic missile tests and to set up a hotline between their coastguards.
Both nations routinely test nuclear capable missiles but for the past few years they have always given prior notice despite the lack of a formal agreement.
The coastguard hotline deal would lead to early exchange of information between the two sides on arrests of fishermen who inadvertently stray into rival waters, the statement said.
The peace process was launched in early 2004 to resolve eight issues including the dispute over the Muslim majority Himalayan state of Kashmir, which is divided between Indian and Pakistan and claimed in full by both.
In symbolic, confidence building gestures, the two countries have started a cross border bus service in Kashmir and resumed sporting ties, but progress has been sluggish on central problems such as Kashmir itself.
Saran said both sides were committed to finding a "mutually acceptable" solution to Kashmir but ruled out any change in borders.
The Islamabad foreign ministers meeting follows a summit in September between Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New York that ended without any major initiatives.
India and Pakistan Wednesday agreed to start a bus service in October linking two cities on either side of their only border crossing as part of an ongoing peace process, an official here said.
The agreement came after two days of talks in the Indian capital.
It will be only the second bus service crossing India and Pakistan's international border.
"The trial run of the Lahore Amritsar bus service being operated by both sides will take place in the second half of October 2005 with a view to starting regular bus service in the first half of November 2005," Dilip Sinha, a joint secretary at the Indian foreign ministry, read from a joint statement.
In April, India and Pakistan agreed on the first bus service to link divided Kashmir in almost 60 years as part of a peace process begun in January 2004.
But the service, which crosses the ceasefire Line of Control separating the Indian and Pakistan zones of the Himalayan state, has been opposed by some separatist groups as well as by Islamic rebels fighting Indian rule in the disputed region.
The Lahore Amritsar bus, covering 45 kilometres (28 miles), will link the two countries via the only international land crossing at Wagah in the state of Punjab, divided between India and Pakistan at partition in 1947.
A bus service linking New Delhi and Lahore, originally started in 1999 by former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee but suspended after a 2001 attack on India's parliament by suspected Pakistan backed militants, was restarted in July 2003.
The two sides also said Wednesday they would hold further talks on a proposed bus service between Amritsar and the Pakistani town of Nankana Sahib, the site of a Sikh shrine near Lahore.
The bus services are part of broader efforts by nuclear armed neighbors India and Pakistan to normalise relations after coming to the brink of war after the parliament attack.
Both sides agreed in January last year to enhance economic, transport and cultural links while working to resolve a dispute over Kashmir, the cause of two of their three wars since indepndence.
The first trans Kashmir bus in decades has rolled and dozens of families have been reunited across the divide, but real progress by nuclear rivals India and Pakistan on their core dispute over Kashmir remains a long way off, analysts say.
"We basically see this as one of the confidence building measures," said Ajai Sahni of the New Delhi based Institute of Conflict Management.
"We must understand that for Pakistan, none of the fundamentals have really altered in terms of intent or claim."
The first bus service spanning divided Kashmir in nearly 60 years ran simultaneously Thursday from Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir and Muzaffarabad, capital of the Pakistan administered zone.
Passengers crossed the heavily militarised Kashmir frontier despite attempts by militants on the Indian side to derail the historic journey with a blast along the route and an attack a day earlier on a guesthouse complex in Srinagar where the passengers were staying.
At the end of the day, 30 people travelled the 160 kilometre (100 mile) route from Muzaffarabad while 19 down from an original 29 went in the opposite direction.
They were greeted with sweets and garlands by thousands of people when they arrived on the other side, while members of divided families hugged each other with tears rolling down their cheeks.
"All these measures can easily be reversed the moment the circumstances are altered for Pakistan," Sahni said.
"And President (Pervez) Musharraf has made this abundantly clear when he says that unless Kashmir is solved, there can be more Kargils."
Indian and Pakistan backed intruders fought a short duration conflict in the high mountains of Kargil sector of Kashmir in 1999.
Nearly 1000 combatants on both sides were killed.
I.A. Rehman, director of the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, sounded a similar cautionary note.
"It was good that despite the fire and the shooting the buses reached their destinations and the two governments did a splendid job," he told AFP in Islamabad.
"(But) it does not mean that there are no hurdles left.
There is a long way to go, but the road to peace is getting clear."
Kashmir was divided between India and Pakistan after a 1947 war but it is claimed in full by both countries.
Family members separated by the division of the picturesque Himalayan region have longed to meet each other again but have had to take a long roundabout route which also depended on being granted hard to get visas by New Delhi or Islamabad.
Though the bus has been hailed as a powerful symbol for peace by the media and analysts on both sides, there is little dispute that the event marks only a small step on the long road to rapprochement for the nuclear rivals, who have fought three wars two over Kashmir and came close to a fourth in 2002.
Senior Pakistani defence analyst, retired brigadier Abdur Rehman Siddiqui, however said the bus service was here to stay.
"It may not be as historic as the fall of Berlin Wall, but something close to it ,It's not only symbolic but this confidence building measure is irreversible," he said.
Tauseed Ahmed, professor of Mass Communication at Federal Urdu University, said: "It is good to see buses of peace and not tanks or guns en route to Kashmir.
"It's good to see friends meeting friends, families meeting families without any feeling of hatred," he added.
"The forces of peace may replace the forces of hatred if more people started travelling, he said, but warned that hostile elements may again try to sabotage the process.
"Give peace a chance and the Kashmir issue can be resolved," Ahmed said.
Indian analyst Sahni believes the bus has indeed taken forward the slow moving peace process between India and Pakistan which began in January last year and has improved the atmosphere before Musharraf's scheduled visit to New Delhi next weekend.
Musharraf is due to watch a one day cricket match between India and Pakistan on April 17.
He will also hold talks with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh their first formal talks since Singh became premier last May.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf Monday said nobody will be allowed to disrupt the Indo Pak peace process, according to New Delhi TV (NDTV).
Musharraf, who met Indian editors over breakfast at New Delhi's Taj Man Singh Hotel, said that India and Pakistan have approached all issues with sincerity.
Giving a call for creating a consensus on the Kashmir issue, Musharraf said the Kashmir issue should be resolved amicably.
He said the Line of Control (LoC) and soft border cannot be accepted as the solution.
Musharraf said he had come to India with a renewed mindset and had achieved more than he had expected.
He added that the talks between the Indian and Pakistan officials were for harmony and goodwill.
Musharraf also said that an "out of the box" solution has to be found with regard to Kashmir which is acceptable to India, Pakistan and the people of Kashmir.
The Kashmir "dispute" has to be resolved and it needs analysis, and the two countries have to move forward on it, Musharraf said.
Asserting that the terrorist attack to derail the bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad was not acceptable, Musharraf said a decision has been taken and the peace process cannot be allowed to be disrupted.
Musharraf asserted that unless the Kashmir "dispute" was resolved it can "erupt" in the future under "different leadership and different environment" in the two countries.
"Right now, we are having a very good relationship with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
But nobody is permanent in this world," Musharraf said emphasizing that the issue has to be resolved.
India and Pakistan on Wednesday agreed to expedite the opening of bank branches in each other's country and improve air and shipping services, a government statement said.
Commerce Ministry officials from both countries met Tuesday and Wednesday to devise a roadmap for economic cooperation and review progress made in easing customs rules and non tariff barriers since the trade talks were launched a year ago.
Both countries have lifted some trade barriers and allowed goods to be shipped by road between them after a gap of nearly five decades.
Officials would meet soon to formulate recommendations to further ease non tariff barriers and enhance customs cooperation and trade, the statement said.
"Requests for opening of bank branches in both countries would be processed expeditiously to facilitate bilateral trade relations," it said.
Indian and Pakistani banks had branches in each other's country until they closed in 1965 when the rivals fought one of the three wars between them since they gained independence from Britain in 1947.
The statement also said that talks to review the existing air services agreement and the shipping protocol would be held in September.
A fiber optic link to improve telecommunications between the neighboring countries would be established soon, the statement said.
Economic ties between India and Pakistan improved after peace talks began last year.
Trade between them totaled US$600 million in the year that ended in March double the annual average for the past decade, said India's Commerce Ministry spokeswoman, Shipra Biswas.
But that's still only about 0.5 percent of the value of trade the two nations carry on with the rest of the world each year.
Business leaders say there is vast potential for expanding commercial ties between India and Pakistan, which together have some 1.2 billion people.
The growth of cross border trade, however, has been stunted by their five decade dispute over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which both nations claim.
Of all the signs the India Pakistan peace process is producing tangible dividends, one stands out: Kashmir is running low on chickens.
Chickens are the key ingredient in the traditional Kashmiri wedding feast, and with the Indian Pakistan peace process producing the region's most peaceful summer since the start of Kashmir's Islamic insurgency in 1989, this year's wedding season is among the most festive in years.
Kashmir lies at the heart of the India Pakistan rivalry the neighbors have fought two wars over the predominantly Muslim region, which is split between them but claimed by both.
On Wednesday, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said they would continue to pursue peace in Kashmir after meeting on the sidelines of a U.N. summit in New York.
"Our nations must not remain trapped by hate and history, in a cycle of confrontation and conflict," Musharraf said Wednesday in an address to the U.N. General Assembly.
"For this to happen, it is essential to find a just solution to the problems of Jammu Kashmir."
It's statements like that which have Kashmiris again celebrating late into the night swaying to soulful old wedding songs at parties that often have more than 1000 guests.
"Weddings were not as much fun a couple of years ago as they are now one can't enjoy if one lives in fear," said Aijaz Banday, a 42 year old banker.
"A lot has changed over the past few years.
You couldn't imagine staying out and partying so late in those days."
Tourists, most of them Indians, are also back in record numbers 600000 so far this year with two more months of the season left.
Those are the highest numbers since 1989, and almost twice the number of arrivals last year.
And everyone is eating chicken.
"There is a big shortage of chicken.
I am getting frantic calls," said Riaz Ahmed, owner of Shaan Poultry in Srinagar.
To meet the soaring demand, Ahmed is trying to order chickens from other parts of India.
But the supplies must meet the approval of finicky Meraj ud Din, the latest in a long line of legendary Kashmiri chefs who have for generations prepared traditional weddings feasts of up to 40 courses, known as a "wazwan."
Wazwan platters each shared by four people include succulent pieces of lamb, rice and vegetables and are crowned by at least one whole chicken that Meraj ud din demands weigh between one kilogram (2.2 pounds) and 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds).
Heavier or lighter birds would look too small or too big on the platter, he says.
Less violence means more festive wazwans.
"There are so many weddings this season, Kashmiris will be eating out all of this month.
There is great pressure," said Ahmed, the chicken seller.
The number of attacks in Jammu Kashmir was down by 25 percent from January to July compared to the same period last year, dropping from more than 1600 to just over 1200, officials have said.
More than 66000 people have died since the start of the insurgency.
"This has been a far better summer than many summers before," said Police Inspector General Javed Makhdoomi.
"The atmosphere has changed.
People feel more secure and safe."
With Kashmiris feeling safer, another wedding tradition has also been revived the stopping of wedding caravans on the first bridge they cross so the driver of the bride and groom's car can be paid a customary fee for crossing the span.
The groom pays the fee.
In years past, stopping long lines of cars on the iron and wooden bridges of Srinagar, Indian Kashmir's summer capital, would be strictly forbidden by skittish Indian soldiers who feared the vehicles could be packed with explosives.
These days, however, soldiers stand aside and watch the ceremonies, which involve feverish honking, cheering and clapping on car choked bridges.
"These days I am reminded of my childhood, when I went to weddings holding my father's hand," said Mohammed Zakariya, 31, a trader.
"But all these years, having fun at weddings became impossible."
In a land riven by sorrow, some small joys are returning.
Moderate separatist leaders from Indian Kashmir returned home Thursday from a historic trip to Pakistan in upbeat mood, saying they were ready to hold a new round of talks with New Delhi on the future of the troubled Himalayan region.
The eight leaders, who have been on a two week visit to Pakistan, arrived on the new bi monthly trans Kashmir bus service at Kaman Post, on the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border dividing mainly Muslim Kashmir between India and Pakistan, early afternoon.
They were to continue their journey to Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian administered Kashmir, in a motorcade under tight security by India's security forces.
"It's been a very successful trip for us," said Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, leader of the moderate faction of Kashmir's main separatist alliance, the All Parties Hurriyat Conference.
"We're ready for talks with New Delhi but it's for them to decide when they want to talk," Farooq told AFP shortly after crossing back into the Indian zone of the divided territory.
New Delhi had previously forbidden separatist leaders from travelling to Pakistan and refuses negotiate with them, despite a peace process launched by India and Pakistan in 2004.
The South Asian rivals have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir, which they each hold in part but claim in its entirety.
The moderates, who are demanding that Kashmiris be included in talks between India and Pakistan on resolving their decades old dispute on Kashmir, held two meetings with India's government early in 2004 but the talks stalled when the Congress party won power in elections last May.
"The biggest benefit from the trip is that Kashmiris are being accepted as a party to the dispute," Farooq said.
Separatist leaders in Indian Kashmir seek a three way dialogue with the Indian and Pakistan governments to sort out the region's future.
"Our triangular approach has been appreciated in Pakistan and in Pakistan administered Kashmir," Farooq added.
During their visit, the Hurriyat leaders held talks with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, and a host of other leaders, including Syed Salahuddin, chief of a broad alliance of groups battling Indian rule in Muslim majority Kashmir.
"We spoke to Syed Salahuddin about how to consolidate the ongoing peace process," Farooq said.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf said Thursday during a trip to Australia that there was "light at the end of the tunnel" in the dispute but warned flexibility was needed on both sides to resolve the issue.
The insurgency against Indian rule in Kashmir has left more than 40000 people dead by official count.
Separatists say the toll is twice as high.
Suspected Muslim rebels killed three policemen, a state political party member and two others in the first attacks on police in Kashmir since Indian and Pakistan leaders met two week's ago, police said Thursday.
The three policemen, one an officer, were killed in the summer capital Srinagar and northern Baramulla district overnight, a police spokesman said.
"The officer was brought out of his house by suspected militants and killed by slitting his throat," he said of the officer killed in Baramulla.
Two other officers were shot dead one inside his house and the other while on duty near Kashmir's central jail in Srinagar.
No group claimed responsibility for the killings, the first of security force personnel since Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Pervez Musharraf held talks in New Delhi two weeks ago.
The two countries launched a peace process 15 months ago and after their talks in New Delhi described it as "irreversible."
The officer's slaying sparked a protest demonstration in the Nishat area of the city, with people demanding action against killers, residents said.
In other violence, suspected rebels Thursday shot dead a member of the state's ruling Peoples Democratic Party, Yasin Magray, at a busy bus stand in southern Kulgam town, 70 kilometers (43 miles) south of Srinagar, the spokesman said, adding a student was injured in the shoot out.
Police said suspected rebels also shot dead a former colleague and a Muslim labourer in two separate incidents in the neighbouring district of Pulwama.
The rebels often target pro India politicians and people they suspect of working for Indian troops.
Thousands of people have died in Kashmir since the launch of armed insurgency in the Himalayan region in 1989.

"We view the adoption of the anti secession law as unfortunate.
It does not serve the purpose of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said here Monday that the Anti Secession law has been made to strengthen and advance ties across the Taiwan Straits, instead of being a war mobilization order.
The Anti Secession Law aims to strengthen and advance relations across the Taiwan Straits and aims at maintaining peace, Wen told Chinese and foreign journalists who covered the just ended annual parliament session.
It does not target the Taiwan compatriots, nor is it a law on war against Taiwan, he said, adding that the law states clearly it aims to promote exchanges between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, encourage and facilitate economic cooperation, the three "direct links", as well as exchanges in various fields including education, science and technology and culture.
Taiwan President Chen Shui bian condemned China Wednesday for "heightening regional tensions" by passing an anti secession law this week, in his first comments since the legislation came into force.
"Chinese communists have enacted a law of aggression which unilaterally altered the cross strait status quo, heightening regional tensions and triggering disturbances in the world community," Chen said.
More countries across the world have expressed their support for China's Anti Secession Law, which was passed on last Monday by China's National People's Congress to prevent the secession of Taiwan from China.
In Latin America, the Bolivia China parliamentarian friendship group sent a letter Tuesday to Wu Bangguo, chairman of China's NPC Standing Committee, expressing its support for the newly adopted law.
It said the one China principal has been affirmed by United Nations resolutions, and that the Taiwan question is China's internal affair and should not be interfered by any foreign countries.
In Saint Lucia, both Hilford Deterville, President of Senate, and J. Baden Allain, speaker of House of Assembly, voiced their full understanding and support for the Anti Secession Law on last Thursday.
They vowed to support the government's adherence to the one China policy.
In Namibia, Magreth Mensah Williams, vice chair of National Council, spoke highly of the anti secession law, saying her parliament supports China's efforts to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Addressing the parliament, Mensah Williams said that it is the core interest for every country to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
"There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China," she said.
What China has done will be conducive to helping maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, the Asia Pacific region and the world at large, said Mensah Williams.
The Anti Secession Law, intended to prevent Taiwan's secession from China, came into effect last Monday after Chinese President Hu Jintao signed a presidential decree to promulgate it.
The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) condemned Beijing Monday for passing the Anti Secession Law targeting Taiwan, saying the law is causing irreparable damage to the development of cross strait relations.
In a written statement, the DPP caucus condemned the move as severely infringing upon the freedom, dignity and security of the Taiwan people, and urged the Taiwan people to spare no efforts in denouncing it.
The statement said that the Republic of China is an independent sovereign state belonging to the 23 million people of Taiwan.
Any move to change Taiwan's status quo, if not agreed upon by the Taiwan people through a democratic referendum, is unacceptable, it added.
The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are two separate political entities, it said, adding that the fact that the ROC government exercises exclusive sovereignty in the Taiwan area should be respected by the PRC and the international community as well.
The DPP caucus called for the international community to denounce Beijing's Anti Secession Law, saying that the law authorizes "non peaceful means" against Taiwan and is poised to escalate cross strait tension and undermine stability in the Asia Pacific region.
The law also goes against the U.N. Charter's aim of safeguarding world peace and runs counter to the universal values of freedom, democracy and human rights, the statement said.
Meanwhile, members of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally party of the ruling DPP, have decided to hold a 24 hour hunger strike beginning 4 p.m. Monday to express their vehement opposition to Beijing's passage of the Anti Secession Law.
The sit in to be staged by TSU Chairman Su Chin chiang, ranking TSU officials and major party members is also aimed at urging President Chen Shui bian to immediately initiate a nationwide defensive referendum, TSU legislative party whip Lo Chih ming said.
Lo said that the Executive Yuan should designate March 14 as "Taiwan Anti Aggression Day" to mark the day that China passed a law to try to legitimatize its suppression of Taiwan's sovereignty.
He added that the government should immediately close all communication channels with China and freeze all exchanges across the Taiwan Strait to prevent Taiwan from "falling into China's trap."
Taiwan share prices closed sharply lower Tuesday, falling 1.50 percent on concerns over the outlook for cross strait relations after China adopted an anti secession law targeting the island, dealers said.

Referring to the newly passed Anti Secession Law, she said France understands China's stance on promoting dialogue across the Taiwan Strait and firmly supports China's efforts to realize national reunification.
Meanwhile, Cuba's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that " Cuba, from the very triumph of the revolution, has supported the territorial integrity of China and the cause of the Chinese national reunification."
The Anti Secession Law will help promote peaceful reunification, maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity of China, it said.
Kenya's parliament and government also voiced support for the law aimed at peaceful reunification of the country.
"Kenya, as a friend of China, has always supported the one China policy and will never support Taiwan's secession from China, " Speaker of the National Assembly of Kenya Francis Ole Kaparo said while meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Guo Chongli.
The Kuwaiti government and parliament support China's adoption of the Anti Secession Law, Kuwaiti National Assembly Speaker Jasim Mohmmad Al Kharafi said while meeting with Chinese ambassador Wu Jiuhong.
Kuwait believes that the adoption of the Anti Secession Law will contribute to China's stability, development and reunification, Al Kharafi said.
Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa hailed the newly passed law, saying he is extremely pleased to see the enactment of the Anti Secession Law by the National People's Congress, China's legislature, in Beijing on Monday.
Mwanawasa said Zambia supports the one China policy and strongly believes that Taiwan is an integral part of China.
Madagascar Foreign Minister Marcel Ranjeva said Tuesday night that his country views the law as part of China's efforts to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity in a statement broadcast on state television.
At a meeting with visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing, Speaker of the House of Representatives of Bosnia Herzegovina Sefik Dzaferovic said his country respects, understands and supports China's adoption of the Anti Secession Law.
Dzaferovic said his country appreciates China's efforts to pursue peaceful reunification, and safeguard state sovereignty and territorial integrity, noting that the adoption of the law will facilitate a peaceful solution to the Taiwan question.
US lawmakers expressed "grave concern" Wednesday over a Chinese law giving legal backing for an invasion of Taiwan if the country moves toward formal independence.
The US House of Representatives voted 424 4 in favor of a resolution warning that the anti secession legislation alters "the status quo in the region, and thus is of grave concern to the United States."
The resolution urges President George W. Bush to direct US officials to express to their Chinese counterparts "the grave concern with which the United States views the passage of China's anti secession law in particular, and the growing Chinese military threats to Taiwan in general."
"The Government of the United States should reaffirm its policy that the future of Taiwan should be resolved by peaceful means and with the consent of the people of Taiwan," it said, adding that the US government should continue to encourage dialogue between Taiwan and China.
China's National People's Congress passed the law on Monday.
The enacting of an anti secession law by Beijing will diminish cross Taiwan Strait exchanges and thus will be harmful to the development of bilateral ties, a scholar said Monday.
Shu Yung ming, an assistant researcher with Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest research institute, said in a seminar that the people of Taiwan will be afraid of visiting the mainland after the legislation is approved due to its ambiguous definition of secessionist activities.
The people of Taiwan could be arrested when visiting the mainland because of remarks they might make in Taiwan and other areas that are considered by the Beijing authorities as violations of the proposed law, he explained.
Besides, he went on, none of the candidates running for public office in Taiwan can avoid expressing their opposition to the proposed law during their campaigns under the country's current political circumstances.
Furthermore, he continued, the enacting of the anti secession law will squeeze the political space of those who actually support Taiwan's reunification with the mainland.
The proposed anti secession law, which will be deliberated by China's top legislature, the National People's Congress (NPC), at its upcoming annual full session, is by no means a so called "law on the use of force against Taiwan", nor a so called "war mobilization order", a spokesman for the NPC session said here Friday.
China Tuesday said that "one country, two systems" is its basic approach to Taiwan as it outlined for the first time its anti secession law aimed at the island.
China's enactment of the Anti Secession Law, as part of the overarching principle, is to closely focus on the theme of opposing and checking the secessionist activities of the "Taiwan independence" forces and promoting China 's peaceful reunification, a senior Chinese lawmaker said here Tuesday.
Both the United States and the European Union think mainland China's planned anti secession legislation is counterproductive to peace across the Taiwan Strait, Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Monday.
Chen made the remarks after presiding over a Lunar New Year gathering at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) auditorium.
He said the government sent six delegations to the United States, Japan and EU countries last year to brief officials, academics and opinion leaders on the adverse impact on cross strait relations of Beijing's planned anti secession law, which targets Taiwan.
The MOFA has also instructed embassies and representative offices abroad to express to their host governments Taiwan's opposition to the proposed legislation, Chen said.
The mainland's rubber stamp parliament the National People's Congress is scheduled to screen the so called anti secession law in March.
Chen said such a move could draw a backlash and protests from the people of Taiwan and could hinder cross strait rapprochement.
An official of the Cabinet level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Wednesday that the government will closely monitor developments in mainland China's communications with the United States about its plan to enact an anti secession law.
MAC Deputy Chairman Chiu Tai shan made the remarks a day after Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under Beijing's State Council, arrived in Washington to discuss with U.S. officials the details of the planned anti secession law targeting Taiwan.
The mainland's plan to promulgate an anti secession law is not only a tremendous provocation of Taiwan but also a unilateral move to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, Chiu told reporters.
Chiu said that the MAC, the top agency in charge of Taiwan's policies toward the mainland, has expressed on public occasions its strong opposition to the legislation aimed at legalizing Beijing's invasion of the country.
Stressing that Taiwan is not part of the People's Republic of China as the Beijing authorities claim, Chiu said this is also the feeling of a majority of the people of Taiwan.
Meanwhile, Michel Lu, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that officials of the Republic of China representative office in the United States will keep a close eye on developments.
The government will also continue to express its opposition to the proposed anti secession law, which, if passed, would offer a legal basis for Beijing to use force against Taiwan, Lu went on.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) agreed in late December to submit the draft bill to a NPC plenary session for deliberation in March this year.
Mainland China is pushing Taiwan to decide through a referendum whether to "separate from the mainland" if it makes the "one country, two systems" or "one China" principle a part of its proposed anti secession law, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu said Tuesday.
Speaking with a group of pro Taiwan independence activists, Wu said Taiwan will have no choice other than to ask its people to decide in a referendum whether to unite with the mainland on Beijing's terms of "one country, two systems" or whether to accept the "one China" principle if Beijing enshrines either of them in its proposed law.
He warned Beijing that the enactment of the so called "anti secession law" is a provocation and an attempt to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, which Taiwan will not tolerate.
The pro independence activists called on the government to respond strongly to Beijing's proposal to enact an anti secession law designed to frighten Taiwan into giving up moves toward independence.
The Legislative Yuan will pass a resolution against Beijing's anti secession legislation, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin pyng said Thursday.
Wang made the announcement after a cross party consultative meeting to discuss certain critical legislative bills.
During the meeting, Wang said, legislative whips of ruling and opposition parties reached a consensus on adopting a resolution to voice opposition to Beijing's so called anti secession law targeting Taiwan.
President Chen Shui bian called for the nation Friday to seriously face Beijing's proposed anti secession law which he said would undermine stability across the Taiwan Strait if enacted.
The president made the remarks while reviewing the operations and capability of an army unit in Pingtung, southern Taiwan.
Chen said that Beijing has been actively engaging in "psychological, legal and media warfare" in pushing to enact the anti secession law, which he said is aimed at establishing a legal justification for a military invasion of Taiwan.
The National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee late last year placed the anti secession bill on the agenda for the annual session of the NPC set for this March.
The president reiterated remarks he made in his New Year's address in which he condemned Beijing's plans to enact an anti secession law as a unilateral attempt to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.
Chen called the proposed law the biggest threat to regional stability and peace in the world.
The United States hopes mainland China will put off its plan to enact an "anti secession law" to help temper the tension across the Taiwan Strait, an American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) official said Tuesday.
Raymond F. Greene, chief of the political section at the AIT's Taipei office, made the remarks during a visit to the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), according to Lai Ching teh, one of the caucus leaders.
Greene expressed concern about the DPP's attitude toward the "anti secession law" and whether it will promote a law to counteract it, Lai said.
He also expressed worry that cross strait tension will escalate as a result of the enactment of the law and any move by Taiwan to retaliate, Lai said.
Lai told Greene that the DPP has repeatedly displayed goodwill to Beijing to try to improve cross strait relations but it has to show its resolve to defend Taiwan's sovereignty in the face of the mainland's plan to introduce the "anti secession law."
While the DPP and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, will organize a demonstration for this purpose Feb 28, they are likely to cooperate to propose a piece of counteracting legislation after the "anti secession law" is passed, Lai said.
Asked whether the "anti secession law" is the reason behind the United States' and Japan's recent decision to list "encouraging the peaceful resolution of issues concerning the Taiwan Strait through dialogue" part of their common strategic objectives in the region, Greene said Washington has a long standing concern over peace in the Asia Pacific region and that this concern will not change because of the "anti secession law," according to Lai.
Also during the visit, Greene expressed the hope that the Legislative Yuan will pass the budget for a NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) arms procurement package from the United States within this session.
The new Supreme Court justice must be a strong advocate for civil rights, and NAACP members are pressuring lawmakers to make that a priority in the selection process, NAACP officials said at the group's annual convention Saturday.
"We very badly want to support a nominee committed to justice and fair play," said Julian Bond, chairman of the board of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
"We don't want to have to oppose a nominee who is opposed to those things,We hope to support someone who brings the country together rather than drives the country apart."
Bond's comments came on the opening day of the group's 96th annual convention, where more than 8000 people are expected to discuss issues such as reparations for slavery, renewal of the voting rights act and ways of increasing membership.
The gathering comes as the group works to overcome budget shortfalls and recover from allegations that its former president, Kweisi Mfume, played favorites among employees and mismanaged the national staff.
It is also fighting an investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, which claims that NAACP officials' strong criticisms of the Bush administration violated the group's nonprofit status.
Last month, the Baltimore based nonprofit selected a new president, Bruce S. Gordon, who will start in the job Aug 1.
On Sunday, a seminar will focus on who will fill the Supreme Court seat that will be vacated by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her retirement July 1.
NAACP members are being urged to contact the White House and their senators to influence selection of the nominee, said Hilary Shelton, head of the NAACP's Washington, D.C., branch.
"We've educated our members on this," Shelton said.
"We've been doing this ever since we knew the chief justice (William Rehnquist) had thyroid cancer."
The convention also will highlight the persistent health disparities between blacks and other groups, with panel discussions, free health screenings and fitness sessions planned each day.
"African Americans have the worst health outcomes of all groups," said Evelyn Lewis, a physician with Pfizer Inc., a pharmaceutical company, who spoke on a panel Saturday.
"This is a civil rights issue."
The NAACP's health committee is investigating how well hospitals address racial gaps particularly by having black physicians on staff and it will grade hospitals in a report card to be released next year, said Rupert Richardson, an NAACP board member from Louisiana and chairwoman of the group's national health committee.
"This is a problem everywhere," Richardson said.
NAACP officials also announced that Howard Dean, chair of the Democratic National Committee, and Ken Mehlman, chair of the Republican National Committee, will participate in a discussion on political issues on Thursday.
Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman appointed to the US Supreme Court and a frequent swing vote, announced her retirement Friday, setting up a fierce political showdown for her seat.
The move handed President George W. Bush his first chance to reshape the ideological balance of the court, which has immense influence over the lives of Americans, interprets the constitution and acts as a court of last resort.
Minutes after O'Connor's announcement, political leaders and lobby groups fired the first shots in a long brewing battle for the court's political soul.
Liberals warned Bush not to name an "extremist" while Republicans urged him to pick someone who would apply rather than interpret the constitution in other words a strict conservative.
"The nation deserves and I will select a Supreme Court justice that Americans can be proud of," Bush said.
"The nation also deserves a dignified process of confirmation in the United States Senate, characterised by fair treatment, a fair hearing and a fair vote," Bush said in a statement delivered in the White House Rose Garden.
Bush said he would pick a new justice in a "timely manner" but the White House said there would be no announcement before he returns from next week's G8 summit in Scotland.
The president was set to pore over profiles of potential Supreme Court picks during the long flight to Europe, his spokesman Scott McClellan said.
Justices are not term limited, so presidents have a chance to mould the country for years after they leave the political scene, through their court choices.
Bush's chance to remake the court is all the more important because key cases on abortion, assisted suicide and gay rights are looming when justices return from their summer break in October.
Democratic activists fear that Bush will replace O'Connor, who cast the key votes in two key abortion rights test cases in 2000, with a 'pro life' justice.
O'Connor, a snowy haired 75 year old judge and former prosecutor told Bush her retirement would become effective upon the confirmation of a successor.
"It has been a great privilege indeed to have served as a member of the Court for 24 terms," she wrote in a letter to Bush.
"I will leave it with enormous respect for the integrity of the Court and its role under our constitutional structure," wrote O'Connor, who was born in Texas and practiced law in the southwestern state of Arizona.
Bush and O'Connor spoke in what aides said was an "emotional" phone call.
With a nod to their shared Texas heritage, Bush said: "for an old ranching girl, you turned out pretty good," according to McClellan.
O'Connor was appointed by president Ronald Reagan and took her seat in September 1981.
She often sided with more radical conservatives on the court, as when she voted with the majority to stop recounts in Florida after the 2000 election, effectively handing the White House to Bush over Al Gore.
Cancer stricken Chief Justice William Rehnquist had been seen as the most likely justice to retire, but has so far made no announcement on his future.
O'Connor's retirement opens the first vacancy on the Supreme Court in 11 years.
The last justice appointed was the liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, who was named by president Bill Clinton and he took his seat in August 1994.
It leaves Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the sole woman on the nine justice Supreme Court bench.
Senator Edward Kennedy, who famously scuppered the confirmation of Ronald Reagan's Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, called on Bush to appoint someone who could be embraced by all Americans.
"Justice O'Connor was a mainstream conservative who was confirmed unanimously by the Senate," Kennedy said.
"President Bush is faced with a decision that affects each and every American."
Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said: "America needs judges who are fair, independent, unbiased and committed to equal justice under the law."
The liberal political action committee MoveOn.org swiftly rolled out a television advertising campaign.
"The message: Don't nominate an extremist who will undermine the rights of individuals and families as the President did in the Terri Schiavo case several months ago," MoveOn.org said in a statement, referring to the recent Florida right to die controversy.
US President George W. Bush on Wednesday chastised critics of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales as a potential candidate for the recently vacated seat in the Supreme Court.
"I don't like it when a friend gets criticized.
I'm loyal to my friends," the US leader said of Gonzales during a brief stop in Denmark on Wednesday before attending the G8 summit in Scotland.
Republicans and Democrats are geared up for a major political fight over a successor to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her retirement last Friday.
The vacancy handed Bush his first chance to reshape the ideological balance of the nine member high court, which has immense influence over the lives of Americans as it interprets the constitution.
Liberals warned Bush not to name an "extremist" who could undermine women's right to have an abortion, while Republicans have urged him to pick a strict conservative.
Speculation has circled around Gonzales, who has been criticized by both liberals and conservatives, especially for his role in the controversial US policy towards terrorist suspects in captivity.
"(A)ll of a sudden this fellow, who is a good public servant and a really fine person, is under fire,I don't like it at all," Bush told reporters gathered outside Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen's country residence, just north of Copenhagen.
The US leader also reiterated that there would be "no litmus test" on controversial issues like abortion or gay marriage for nominees to the Supreme Court position.
"(A)s I said during both of my campaigns, there will be no litmus test.
I'll pick people who,will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench to legislate from," he said.
Bush's visit, his first to Denmark but his fifth meeting with Rasmussen since 2002, was seen by commentators as a symbolic gesture thanking Denmark for supporting the war in Iraq, where it has deployed more than 500 troops near the southern city of Basra.
The perennial battle over abortion rights in the United States is galvanizing conservative and liberal activists, who are hoping to influence President George W. Bush's choice to fill a newly vacated US Supreme Court seat.
For decades, a deep ideological rift over a woman's right to end an unwanted pregnancy has cleaved this country into two powerful, and equally impassioned camps.
Conservatives, who turned out in record numbers to cast votes last November for the Republican president, see in the retirement of moderate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor a historic chance to reshape the nine member high court, and fulfill a fervent wish to overturn the watershed Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case which guaranteed women the right to an abortion.
Liberals, meanwhile, have sternly warned Bush not to name an "extremist" to the court and have vowed to put up a fierce fight to safeguard the right to legal abortion.
With a Supreme Court seat now open for the first time in more than a decade, groups on both sides of the bitter abortion divide have said they are planning to spend millions to lobby Congress and the White House, and to rally their supporters.
Political observers predicted Armaggedon once the fight to replace O'Connor is joined in earnest, with dozens of political groups expected to play a role.
"I think we're in for a pretty partisan battle," said Orrin Hatch, a conservative US senator and longserving member of the powerful Senate Judiciary committee that will vet US President George W. Bush's eventual Supreme Court nominee.
The debate also is expect to further polarize an already divided US Senate which will be called upon to confirm the president's pick.
"He said he's going to pick a strong conservative, and I think that's going to cause a battle no matter what," Hatch told ABC television Tuesday.
Even before O'Connor announced her departure, the conservative Progress for America group last month launched a 700000 dollar fundraising effort, hoping to beat back "liberal attack groups ,hungry to smear almost any potential candidate for the Supreme Court who doesn't meet their left wing, extemist litmus test."
Likewise, the Family Research Council said on its website that it is "primed for the fight it will take to confirm a nominee," and vowed to mobilize 20000 churches across the nation to lobby for a conservative justice.
Liberal groups were equally motivated: The pro choice Feminist Majority sounded the alarm within hours of O'Connor announcing her retirement.
"This is it!
The worst has happened with the resignation of Sandra Day OConnor," the group said on its website.
"Let there be no mistake about it: Sandra Day OConnor was the fifth vote that was saving Roe vs. Wade," the group said in a dire warning to its supporters.
"Abortion rights and womens rights are on the line."
Another liberal group, MoveOn.org said on its website that it aimed to deliver 300000 petition signatures by Tuesday to the US Senate, asking lawmakers to help preserve the right to end a pregnancy.
And the left leaning "Ms " magazine this month warned its readers that "rolling back reproductive rights is only the first act in a nightmare scenario that could come to pass if right wing judges take over the federal courts and the nations highest court."
Bush said in a newspaper interview published Tuesday that he expected to have a new justice on the bench by October, and already had identified "a good sized" number of prospects.
The US president called on partisan groups to tone down the heated rhetoric, insisting in an interview USA Today that he is immune to the high intensity lobbying.
"I feel no pressure, except the pressure to put somebody on the bench who will bring dignity to the office, somebody who's got the intellect necessary to do the job, somebody of great integrity and somebody who will faithfully interpret the Constitution," Bush said.
WASHINGTON President Dwight D. Eisenhower figured Earl Warren would make an ideal chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
Warren, the Republican governor of California, had been a loyal supporter of Eisenhower in the 1952 election.
Eisenhower said he chose Warren the next year because of his deliberate style and his "middle of the road" philosophy.
Warren turned out to be one of the most liberal justices in history, leading the court to landmark rulings on civil rights and the separation of church and state.
Eisenhower later said appointing Warren was "the biggest damn fool mistake I ever made."
As President Bush searches for someone to succeed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her resignation Friday, the experiences with Warren and many other members of the Supreme Court provide reminders that justices often don't vote the way presidents expect.
Justice Byron White, an appointee of President John Kennedy in 1962, was expected to be a liberal, but often voted conservatively on personal liberty and law and order cases.
O'Connor, named to the court in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan, was more conservative in her early years but gradually sided more often with the court's liberals.
Justice David Souter, an appointee of the first President Bush in 1990, has angered conservative Republicans by often voting with the court's liberals.
"We thought Justice Souter would vote differently than he turned out to vote," said Boyden Gray, White House counsel under former President Bush.
He said many presidents have been unhappy with their appointees.
"The landscape is littered with crushed expectations," Gray said.
"You can never predict or control (how they'll vote).
That's just absolutely a fact a life."
Not enough homework Some justices defy expectations because the presidents who chose them didn't do enough homework.
That was the case with Souter, a state judge in New Hampshire who served briefly as a federal appeals judge before his nomination to the Supreme Court.
Researchers who looked into his record found so little that the press dubbed him "the stealth justice."
White House aides "really didn't know much about him," said Eddie Lazarus, a former clerk for Justice Harry Blackmun and author of Closed Chambers, an inside look at the court.
"That was their own fault."
It was difficult to assess Souter because he had been a federal judge for less than a year.
"Nobody knew what he stood for," said Paul Finkelman, a law professor at the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma.
The experience has prompted a refrain by many conservatives: "No more Souters."
For other vacancies on the court, presidents have nominated former politicians like Warren and White who have little or no judicial experience.
The presidents assumed the nominees would follow their party's ideology, but it turned out the nominees had different ideas.
Mary Cheh, a law professor at George Washington University, said White was a New Deal Democrat who was in favor of "big government and federal programs."
But he surprised many people by often voting conservatively on the court.
"He was consistent that he thought the court should stay out of the way of the legislature," Cheh said.
Transformations Other justices have changed after they got on the court.
In her first few years as a justice, O'Connor was known as the "Arizona Twin" because she voted so often with Chief Justice William Rehnquist, one of the court's most conservative members.
Cheh says O'Connor's opinions in the early days were "very mechanical" and the only issue she was passionate about was states' rights.
But the longer she was on the court, "she became more sensitive to individual rights," Cheh said.
There was a similar transformation for Blackmun, an appointee of President Nixon in 1970.
Blackmun was a longtime Republican, so Nixon and his aides figured he would be a dependable conservative on the court.
In his early years, he frequently voted with conservative Chief Justice Warren Burger.
But Blackmun increasingly sided with liberals and authored the 1973 opinion that is the flashpoint for many conservatives: the Roe vs. Wade decision on abortion rights.
Why the transformations?
Finkelman, the University of Tulsa professor, said getting a lifetime appointment to the nation's highest court leaves people free to make their own judgments without being bound by a rigid ideology.
"Their vantage point is altered," he said.
"Having gotten to the pinnacle, the top of the highest mountain, they suddenly discover there is no place to strive for.
They look at the world differently."
U.S.
Rep Tom Feeney, R Oviedo, said it's more common for Republican appointees to morph into liberals than for Democratic nominees to become conservative.
He blames it on the culture of Washington.
"When you surround yourself by other rich lawyers and liberal policymakers, you tend to grow out of touch with Joe Six Pack and Brenda Babysitter out there in the real world," Feeney said.
Lazarus, the former Blackmun clerk, said he agrees there is a seduction, but said it affects nominees who don't come to the job with a strict ideology.
"Once they get on the court, people who are not ideological get swept up in the majesty of interpreting the Constitution's beautiful but vague promises of due process and equal protection," he said.
"That tends to draw them to the left."
Ideologues don't morph The court's most consistent conservatives are Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
They are the darlings of the right and the foes of the left because they rarely stray from conservative orthodoxy.
Legal analysts say they haven't morphed because they are strict ideologues who apply their principles to every decision.
Many conservative groups are urging President Bush to nominate someone like Thomas and Scalia to be O'Connor's successor.
Liberal groups such as People for the American Way are saying just the opposite, urging Bush to pick a moderate.
But how can either side know what they're getting?
How can they be sure they won't get another Warren or another White?
Both sides are scouring the records of possible nominees to look for clues about how they might vote: judicial opinions, speeches and law review articles.
Ralph Neas, president of People for the America Way, said Bush's nominee "is probably going to be either a judge or an academic with a lengthy record that is faithful to the record of a Thomas or a Scalia."
Gray, the former White House counsel, said Republicans have learned lessons from the nomination of Souter.
"The most important indicator is their track record what have they said, what have they written.
I think if you have a candidate who has a known record, that is the best," Gray said.
Cheh, the George Washington University law professor, said Bush and his aides have learned from history and will thoroughly research possible nominees to make sure they get an ideologue.
"The Republicans," she said, "have made this a high art."
President George W. Bush on Friday said he would nominate a new Supreme Court Justice in a timely manner, and called for a dignified confirmation battle, as rival political camps geared up for battle.
Bush made a statement in the White House Rose Garden, shortly after Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement.
"Under the Constitution, I am responsible for nominating a sucessor for Justice O'Connor.
I take this responsibility seriously.
I will be deliberate and thorough in this process," Bush said.
"The nation deserves and I will select a Supreme Court Justice that Americans can be proud of," Bush said.
"The nation also deserves a dignified process of confirmation in the United States Senate, characterised by fair treatment, a fair hearing and a fair vote.
"I will chose a nominee in a timely manner so the hearing and the vote can be compelted before the new Supreme Court term begins."
Bush also paid tribute to O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the top US court.
"America is proud of Justice O'Connor's distinguished service and I am proud to know her," he said.
"She has been a discerning and conscientious judge and a public servant of complete integrity."
Just when we thought there was no new speculation about President Bush's pending replacement of Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court, along comes a surprise.
During the president's politically correct consultation with the bipartisan Senate leadership this week, several senators urged that someone be considered who is not already on a lower federal bench, the customary source of previous appointments.
A non judge!
What a concept.
The president apparently welcomed the suggestion, although the names being circulated so far in public all wear black robes or did so in the past.
"Would I be willing to consider people who had never been a judge?
The answer is: You bet," Bush told reporters.
He indicated he was already doing so.
"We're considering all kinds of people judges, non judges."
The idea is that a little hands on political experience, such as O'Connor had in the Arizona state legislature before becoming a state court judge, might help the nominee reach sensible judicial judgments the country can support.
Sen Arlen Specter, R Pa., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that career lawyers spend too much time with "footnotes and semicolons" and have "very little contact with people."
Sen Patrick Leahy, D Vt., added that he approved of going "outside the judicial monastery."
This is not as shocking an idea as it seems at first blush.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist, for example, was tapped by President Richard Nixon while an assistant attorney general.
Legal historians point out that of the 108 justices who have served on the Supreme Court, only 48 were actually drawn from the ranks of sitting judges.
The others have been practicing lawyers, attorneys general, Cabinet officers, senators, members of the House, governors, solicitors general and law professors.
Indeed, the Constitution does not even require high court justices to have a law degree.
It merely says that judges, "both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior."
The court under Chief Justice Earl Warren is an example of judicial diversity that has stood the test of time.
That court handed down the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education ruling outlawing school segregation.
Although the Brown decision temporarily caused widespread social turmoil and President Dwight D. Eisenhower later complained that his decision to nominate Warren was his biggest mistake, the unanimous ruling was gradually accepted as the law of the land.
Warren was a former governor and unsuccessful vice presidential candidate and the court included three former U.S. senators.
Their background meant "you had a broader experience," Specter observed.
Rehnquist's bout with thyroid cancer and sudden, short hospital stay this week for a fever have created a spike in speculation that Bush may have two vacancies to fill before the new court term begins in October.
That would give him an opportunity to name simultaneously both a judge and a non judge, broadening the public appeal of his choices.
This adds a new dimension to the partisan argument about whether any new justice should reveal his or her ideological leanings or be judged only on that vague category, "character."
A non judge would have a different sort of record than a legal scholar, reflecting political choices made in real life with real consequences, instead of writings full of abstract philosophical theory.
So whose name might join the gossip circus now?
Sen Orrin Hatch, R Utah, former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has openly lusted for a court seat.
Although an ultraconservative, he is fair minded and could be easily confirmed.
Alas, he is 71 years old, a tad ancient for a lifetime seat the president sees as an important part of his historical legacy.
There are other sitting senators as well who are not extremists and could serve honorably with dignity.
Sen Ben Nelson, D Neb., a moderate and a leader of the bi partisan "gang of 14" that derailed a GOP Senate move to kill the right to filibuster judicial nominations, might be an acceptable bipartisan compromise.
That would also open up a Democratic seat in a red state that Republicans might recapture.
First Lady Laura Bush is publicly plumping for a woman to replace O'Connor, but gender is not foremost in the minds of most legal interest groups.
Bush says he will consider picking a female, but he seems more interested in naming a Hispanic male perhaps Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
Bush is also getting advice from an unusual quarter, the current Supreme Court justices.
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D Nev., said that at a recent luncheon, some of the justices said they would prefer "somebody new on the court" rather than more appellate judges who "sit in their offices and read briefs."
Despite the importance of the work, it can obviously get boring within those marble judicial halls.
Not much dancing in the aisles.
But a lot of people would figuratively kill to get there anyway.

US Republicans and Democrats geared up Saturday for a major political battle over a successor to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who has announced her retirement.
Her decision, announced Friday, handed President George W. Bush his first chance to reshape the ideological balance of the court, which has immense influence over the lives of Americans, interprets the constitution and acts as a court of last resort.
Minutes after O'Connor's announcement, political leaders and lobby groups fired the first shots in a long brewing battle for the court's political soul.
Liberals warned Bush not to name an "extremist" while Republicans urged him to pick someone who would apply rather than interpret the constitution in other words a strict conservative.
"The nation deserves and I will select a Supreme Court justice that Americans can be proud of," Bush said.
"The nation also deserves a dignified process of confirmation in the United States Senate, characterised by fair treatment, a fair hearing and a fair vote," Bush said in a statement delivered in the White House Rose Garden.
Bush said he would pick a new justice in a "timely manner" but the White House said there would be no announcement before he returns from next week's G8 summit in Scotland.
The president was set to pore over profiles of potential Supreme Court picks during the long flight to Europe, his spokesman Scott McClellan said.
No official announcement has been made.
But the most frequently mentioned names include Attorney General Alberto Gonzales as well as federal appeals court judges Michael Luttig, Harvie Wilkinson, John Roberts and former solicitor general Theodore Olson.
Justices are not term limited, so presidents have a chance to mould the country for years after they leave the political scene, through their court choices.
Bush's chance to remake the court is all the more important because key cases on abortion, assisted suicide and gay rights are looming when justices return from their summer break in October.
Democratic activists fear that Bush will replace O'Connor, who cast the key votes in two key abortion rights test cases in 2000, with a 'pro life' justice.
O'Connor, a snowy haired 75 year old judge and former prosecutor, told Bush her retirement would become effective upon the confirmation of a successor.
"It has been a great privilege indeed to have served as a member of the Court for 24 terms," she wrote in a letter to Bush.
"I will leave it with enormous respect for the integrity of the Court and its role under our constitutional structure," wrote O'Connor, who was born in Texas and practiced law in the southwestern state of Arizona.
Bush and O'Connor spoke in what aides said was an "emotional" phone call.
With a nod to their shared Texas heritage, Bush said: "for an old ranching girl, you turned out pretty good," according to McClellan.
O'Connor was appointed by president Ronald Reagan and took her seat in September 1981.
She often sided with more radical conservatives on the court, as when she voted with the majority to stop recounts in Florida after the 2000 election, effectively handing the White House to Bush over Al Gore.
Cancer stricken Chief Justice William Rehnquist had been seen as the most likely justice to retire, but has so far made no announcement on his future.
O'Connor's retirement opens the first vacancy on the Supreme Court in 11 years.
The last justice appointed was the liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, who was named by president Bill Clinton and he took his seat in August 1994.
It leaves Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the sole woman on the nine justice Supreme Court bench.
Senator Edward Kennedy called on Bush to appoint someone who could be embraced by all Americans.
"President Bush is faced with a decision that affects each and every American," warned the Massachusetts Democrat.
Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said: "America needs judges who are fair, independent, unbiased and committed to equal justice under the law."
Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman appointed to the US Supreme Court and a frequent swing vote, has announced her retirement, a court source said Friday.
Her retirement, which sets up a long awaited political battle for a successor and gives President George W. Bush his first chance to select a justice for the high court, was confirmed by a Supreme Court official who requested anonymity.
As rival groups geared up for what is likely to be a bitter nomination battle, Bush scheduled a news conference for 11:15 am (1515 GMT) in the White House Rose Garden, his spokesman Scott McClellan said.
O'Connor, 75, who is considered a moderate conservative, was appointed to the court by president Ronald Reagan and took her seat in September 1981.
Her retirement gives Bush the chance to shape the ideological balance of the court, a fact that could spark a prolonged confirmation battle in the US Senate for a successor, touching on lightning bolt questions such as abortion and the separation of church and state.
Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman ever appointed to the US Supreme Court, said Friday that she is retiring, giving US president George W. Bush his first opportunity to appoint a justice.
"This is to inform you of my decision to retire from my position as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, effective upon the nomination and confirmation of my successor," she said in a letter to Bush.
O'Connor, 75, did not explain why she was resigning.
A Supreme Court spokeswoman said O'Connor needs to spend time with her husband who suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
Her resignation, which will result in the first opening on the US Supreme Court in 11 years, will allow Bush to make his first appointment to the nine member court which makes many vital decisions concerning US society.
Experts said the appointment is set to trigger fierce political battle between the Republicans and Democrats.
In a statement confirming O'Connor's resignation, Bush said he will pick her successor in a timely manner so her vacancy can be filled by the time the court resumes work in October.
He also promised to "be deliberate and thorough" in making the choice and will consult with the Senate which will confirm his nominee.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor offered a quick and pithy reaction to President Bush's nomination of federal appellate judge John Roberts Jr. as her successor on the Supreme Court.
"That's fabulous," she told the Spokane (Wash.)
Spokesman Review after a day of fly fishing.
"He's good in every way, except he's not a woman."
O'Connor's reaction reflects the view of just one person, but as someone who gained a reputation for having an intuitive sense of public attitudes and mores during her two decades on the court, she spotlighted the obvious trade off involved in Bush's decision and may have given voice to the conflicted feelings of many Americans women and minorities in particular to the Roberts selection.
Given the opportunity to maintain some modicum of gender balance on the court, or even make history by appointing the first Latino justice, as many Hispanics had openly advocated, the president selected a white male to fill the O'Connor vacancy.
In doing so, he was following the precedent of most other presidents: in the history of the Supreme Court, only four of more than 130 nominees Justices O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Clarence Thomas and former Justice Thurgood Marshall were not white men.
Whether that presents a serious problem for a president who has made the expansion of the Republican Party's coalition central to his political and governing strategy was a matter of debate Wednesday.
But there was widespread agreement that the selection of Roberts will put more pressure on Bush to name a woman or minority to the court should another vacancy occur during his presidency.
"I think it raises the stakes significantly for the next one, whoever that might be," Democratic strategist Anita Dunn said.
"I think right now there's disappointment.
If there were another vacancy (filled by a white male), there would be anger."
Hispanic leaders were most vocal.
"We're disappointed, to say the least," Hector Flores, national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, said while attending the National Council of La Raza convention in Philadelphia.
Flores had lobbied hard on behalf of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
Manuel Mirabal, president of the National Puerto Rican Coalition, attending the same convention, agreed, saying there might be political consequences for Republicans who hoped to cut deeper into the Democrats' 60 percent share of the Hispanic vote in the last presidential election.
Others questioned how much longer term fallout Bush faces, and even some Democrats pointed to the fact that he has put together diverse Cabinets in both terms and has put women in positions of power in the White House and elsewhere.
But the failure to fill the O'Connor seat with a woman or minority wasn't lost on Bush's allies Wednesday as they sought to rally behind Roberts while addressing the deficiency on the diversity front.
"Some people have asked me, well, didn't you want a woman?
Well, yes, of course I did," said Sen Kay Bailey Hutchison, R Texas.
"Of course I think diversity is important on the Supreme Court.
I would like to see another woman.
I would like to see a Hispanic American on the Supreme Court.
But I believe first and foremost what we want is the very best person.
And, for this time, the president has chosen John Roberts."
Sen Ken Salazar, D Colo., released a letter addressed to the president lamenting what he said was a missed opportunity to assure the inclusion of women at all levels of government.
"You and I both have two daughters," Salazar wrote.
"The profound message we should be giving to them is that their gender creates no limitations for them to live up to their God given potential.
Yet, I fear that with the loss of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor from the United States Supreme Court, we are sending the opposite message."
Hispanic leaders might have been more vocal in their disappointment were it not for the fact that many worried that Bush would appoint a conservative Latino whose views conflict with their own agendas.
"My greatest fear was that President Bush would choose someone who will not be sensitive to our demands," and that fear has not abated, said Cesar Perales, president of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund.
Gonzales was viewed by Hispanics as a Republican centrist, the best they could hope for among the available candidates, according to Rudolph de la Garza, a Columbia University political science professor who specializes in Latino politics, and other experts said.
But supporting him outright would have been awkward, since human rights groups with whom they are allied opposed Gonzales for his role in helping to provide legal authority that led to the torture of prisoners in Iraq.
Democratic strategist Jim Jordan said that by failing to appoint a woman or Latino, Bush had "highlighted a negative stereotype of the party a party that truly only welcomes conservative white males.
That's an unflattering view of the party and one frankly we thought they were trying to ameliorate."
But Republican National Committee spokesman Brian Jones said the committee's vigorous outreach to minorities would continue.
"I don't think this is something that's going to derail the efforts underway at this point," he said.
Republicans said Wednesday they are confident the O'Connor vacancy will not be the last Bush will be asked to fill, given the health of Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
But the Spokane paper reported that O'Connor said she doubted the president would name a woman as chief justice.
"So that almost assures," she said, "there won't be a woman appointed to the court at this time."
Research editor Lucy Shackelford contributed to this report.
US President George W. Bush on Tuesday nominated a 50 year old conservative judge to the US Supreme Court, a move that could shape the outcome of battles over volatile issues like abortion for decades.
"The decisions of the Supreme Court affect the life of every American," the president said in a televised address from the White House, with federal appeals court Judge John Roberts at his side.
"A nominee to that court must be a person of superb credentials and the highest integrity, a person who will faithfully apply the Constitution and keep our founding promise of equal justice under law.
I have found such a person in Judge John Roberts," said Bush.
With the choice, Bush shrugged off pressure to pick a woman to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a moderate conservative who was the first woman to serve on the court and often cast the deciding vote in controversial decisions.
The president urged the divided US Senate, where his Republican party has 55 of 100 seats, to confirm Roberts by the first week of October, when the high court opens a new session.
"This confirmation can be done in a timely manner," said Bush.
"So I have full confidence that the Senate will rise to the occasion and act promptly on this nomination."
The nomination was Bush's first chance to reshape the ideological balance of the court, which has immense influence over the lives of Americans as the final arbiter of the US Constitution and court of last resort.
Because justices serve for life or until they retire, as O'Connor announced she was doing July 1, they regularly decide critical and controversial political and legal issues long after the president who picked them is gone.
In one of those cases, O'Connor sided with her conservative colleagues in a majority decision to stop vote recounts in Florida in the 2000 election, effectively handing the White House to Bush over Al Gore.
The top Democrat in the Senate, Harry Reid, neither endorsed nor rejected Roberts, but set the stage for tough questioning by saying that the nominee had "suitable legal credentials" but required more scrutiny.
"The Senate must review Judge Roberts's record to determine if he has a demonstrated commitment to the core American values of freedom, equality and fairness," Reid said in a statement.
Roberts' last notable decision came only last week when his appeals court overturned a lower court decision that the special military tribunals for suspected terrorists at the Guantanamo detention camp in Cuba were illegal.
The decision was a victory for the Bush administration in its handling of the "war on terrorism" detainees.
But a new appeal is now expected to go to the Supreme Court.
Roberts graduated from Harvard Law School in 1979, was a clerk to arch conservative US Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, served in president Ronald Reagan's White House, and was a senior federal prosecutor under Bush's father, former president George Bush.
O'Connor was appointed by president Ronald Reagan and took her seat in September 1981.
O'Connor's retirement opened the first vacancy on the Supreme Court in 11 years.
The last justice appointed was the liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, who was named by president Bill Clinton and took his seat in August 1994.
It left Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the sole woman on the nine justice Supreme Court bench.
Cancer stricken Chief Justice William Rehnquist had also been seen likely to retire, but he dismissed such talk last week as "speculation and unfounded rumors" and pledged to carry out his duties "as long as my health permits."
The announcement came as Bush's top political strategist, Karl Rove, was under close scrutiny over his possible role in a leak that may have unmasked a CIA agent in July 2003.
Sandra Day O'Connor's retirement from the Supreme Court should make us ponder affirmative action.
Her most influential piece of writing might well be the 2003 court opinion allowing the University of Michigan Law School to continue race based admissions for the time being so long as there were no racial quotas.
It was the first time the court had ever endorsed race based university admissions.
And of course, O'Connor herself was the first woman on the Supreme Court.
When President Reagan nominated her in 1981, affirmative action was fairly new, O'Connor made it look good.
She was superbly qualified, yet presumably would have been overlooked had Reagan not searched expressly for a female.
But that was long ago.
Today, affirmative action is ripe for the junkyard.
There's dramatic evidence in President Bush nominating a garden variety white male to O'Connor's seat.
He said something important by doing so.
Consider the fact that for much of the 20th century, the "Jewish seat" was a Supreme Court convention.
To have one Jew on the court (no more, no less) seemed proper and fitting.
But in time Jews went mainstream and the single "Jewish seat" quietly disappeared.
(There are now two Jewish justices).
Bush has delivered a comparable message to women and minorities: Welcome to the mainstream!
We don't need a "woman's seat" on the court.
There are no more outsiders in American life.
Now let's get rid of affirmative action.
In practice, affirmative action means cheating in a good cause.
(But all cheating, for any cause, gnaws at a nation's moral innards like termites.)
Affirmative action means a plus factor in university admissions, job hiring and promotion for candidates from protected groups, in the interests of "diversity."
(But why should "diversity" mean official "minorities" and women but not libertarians, farmers, Mormons, Texans, children of soldiers, aspiring Catholic priests, etc.?)
Affirmative action is highly unpopular: A 2003 Washington Post Harvard Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 92 percent of the public (86 percent of blacks) agreed that admissions, hiring and promotion decisions "should be based strictly on merit and qualifications other than race/ethnicity."
Only bureaucrats and intellectuals (species that are more closely related than they seem) love affirmative action.
Is it really "cheating"?
In 2003, Linda Chavez, the head of the Center for Equal Opportunity, described University of Michigan freshman admissions as they stood in the mid 1990s: "We found that the odds ratio favoring admission of a black applicant with identical grades and test scores to a white applicant was 174 to 1."
The Supreme Court struck down that admissions procedure, but it's a frightening reminder of what people can do in the name of fairness.
Affirmative actions begs comparison with the Vietnam War: two hugely ambitious programs with no exit strategies.
In 1965, the Johnson administration launched affirmative action.
The Nixon administration relaunched it in 1970, requiring all federal contractors to set "goals and timetables" to govern black hiring.
It spread quickly (as a legal requirement or voluntary policy) to unions, government agencies, big business, universities.
It was intended originally not to create diversity but to stamp out prejudice in a hurry.
As such, it bears another strange resemblance to Vietnam.
You could argue in both cases that we won but refused to admit it.
Some modern historians insist that we defeated the Vietnamese communists, then walked off and let them win by default.
And we have stamped out so much prejudice that nowadays we are at least as strongly bigoted in favor of women and minorities as we are bigoted against them as any 10 year old can tell you.
Textbooks widely used in public schools consistently downplay white men in favor of women and minorities.
(Thomas Edison gets less space than a black scientist who tweaked one of Edison's inventions.
A Navajo physicist gets a detailed write up, but Albert Einstein doesn't appear.
A biologist of the Seneca tribe is credited with nothing noteworthy, but he gets a picture while James Watson and Francis Crick, co founders of modern genetics, don't rate a mention.
At virtually any U.S. university, female or minority faculty candidates are in vastly greater demand than white males.
Affirmative action has turned the United States into an aristocracy.
British aristocrats have enjoyed their own kind of "reverse discrimination" for a thousand years.
America's affirmative action aristocrats were only created a generation ago, until then, they were targets of bigotry themselves.
So what?
No aristocracy is acceptable in the United States.
O'Connor wrote in the University of Michigan ruling that affirmative action must end some day.
George W. might be just the man to end it.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 20: The American people know little about Judge John Roberts Jr., other than that President Bush is nominating him to fill Sandra Day O'Connor's seat on the Supreme Court.
But in the coming weeks that should change.
The Senate has a duty to scrutinize his background and question him closely at his confirmation hearings about substantive areas of the law.
If he is a mainstream conservative, in the tradition of Justice O'Connor, he should be confirmed.
But if on closer inspection he turns out to be an extreme ideologue with an agenda of stripping away important rights, he should not be.
Roberts is a member of the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and before that he was a lawyer in the administrations of President Ronald Reagan and the first President George Bush.
Compared with many of the possible nominees whose names have been circulating, he has a thin record on controversial subjects.
This may have helped him win the nomination because it gives the other side so little to work with.
But it also puts a greater burden on the Senate to determine what kind of a judge he would be.
One of the most important areas for the Senate to explore is Roberts' views on federalism the issue of how much power the federal government should have.
The far right is on a drive to resurrect ancient, and discredited, states' rights theories.
If extremists take control of the Supreme Court, we will end up with an America in which the federal government is powerless to protect against air pollution, unsafe working conditions and child labor.
There are reasons to be concerned about Roberts on this score.
He dissented in an Endangered Species Act case in a way that suggested he might hold an array of environmental laws, and other important federal protections, to be unconstitutional.
There are also serious questions about Roberts' attitude toward abortion rights.
As a lawyer in the first President Bush's administration, he helped write a brief that argued that Roe v. Wade should be overturned.
Bush did the country a service by making his nomination early enough for the Senate to have ample time to investigate the judge's record and hold hearings.
The leaders in both parties should resist any pressures to move quickly.
It would be irresponsible to take a position on the nomination of Roberts until his background is carefully reviewed, and until senators have a chance to question him at length.
The nomination of a new Supreme Court justice is a great moment for the nation, providing new vigor to a great American institution.
The entire country has a stake in the outcome.
Ed Gillespie, the White House commando in charge of the selling of Judge John G. Roberts for a seat on the highest court in the land, was settled into his temporary West Wing office on Friday with a ready army and almost no enemy to fight.
Some war room: the telephones were silent, Fox News was unwatched in a corner, no aides bustled in and out.
With Congress gone for another sultry weekend, it was just Gillespie and his sidekick, Steve Schmidt, a top adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney who is moonlighting as the communications director in the Roberts sales campaign.
What do the two do all day?
"There are meetings punctuated by brief periods of nonmeetings," said Gillespie, who has temporarily vacated his office in his lucrative downtown lobbying firm, Quinn Gillespie & Associates.
Gillespie, the former Republican National Committee chairman who attacked Sen John Kerry as a waffler in the 2004 presidential campaign, appeared in relative repose in a wing chair.
Schmidt parked himself on Gillespie's empty desk.
The much anticipated mother of all Supreme Court battles had yet to be joined.
Roberts had not sparked the kind of partisan uproar that others might have, which would have turned the capital upside down for the rest of the summer.
But it has not yet been a week since President Bush's nomination of Roberts, and whether the relative calm of the moment is a function of the judge's personality or because the hearings are such a long way off is not clear.
Still, both sides are poised for a fight, with millions of dollars ready to be spent.
Groups on the left have been sending millions of e mails messages questioning Roberts' position on abortion, and Democrats were already preparing their topics for his expected grilling before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September.
"He's seen as a nice, open Midwestern fellow," said Sen Charles E. Schumer, D N.Y., a member of the committee.
"But if he refuses to answer any questions or give any further information about himself, that view could change."
In other words, three days after Bush nominated Roberts to replace the retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, it was still a long way to the opening of the court on Oct 3, which is when Bush has said he wants to have his nominee in place.
Gillespie, the White House's favorite pit bull in the 2004 campaign, and Schmidt, a former Bush campaign spokesman, knew the relative calm was unlikely to last.
But he said: "Despite the predictions and the anticipation that things are different now, that it's not going to be like Breyer and Kennedy and Ginsburg and Souter, the fact is, it's a lot like Breyer and Kennedy and Ginsburg and Souter.
The fundamentals have not changed."
Gillespie was referring to the relatively calm confirmation hearings of Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David H. Souter.
SOME DOCUMENTS OF COURT CHOICE TO BE RELEASED (This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS.
It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.)
BRODER WASHINGTON The Bush administration plans to release documents from Judge John G. Roberts' tenure in the White House counsel's office in the mid 1980s and his earlier job working for the attorney general, but will not make public papers covering the four years he spent as principal deputy solicitor general starting in 1989, two senior administration officials said Monday.
The decision fulfilled a request for disclosure of the documents made on Monday by Sen Arlen Specter, R Pa., the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which will hold the confirmation hearings for Roberts, President Bush's choice to fill the Supreme Court seat being vacated by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, said the senator's spokesman, Bill Reynolds.
But it falls short of the disclosure sought by Democrats, who have been demanding access to files from the nominee's work in the solicitor general's office at the Justice Department from 1989 to 1993, under the first President George Bush.
Democrats say those files could shed light on the nominee's thinking about a variety of issues that could come before the court, and are especially important because Roberts has not produced much of a paper trail when it comes to issues like abortion.
Specter did not seek access to the papers from Roberts' work as deputy solicitor general, Reynolds said.
The officials said the administration had decided to waive any claim to attorney client privilege from those documents because the papers are covered by the Presidential Records Act, the law that governs the disposition of presidential papers.
One of the officials, both of whom sought anonymity to speak candidly about a decision that had not yet been made public, said the White House had reviewed some of the papers from Roberts' work in the counsel's office and saw nothing in them that could create problems for his confirmation.
But the officials said the administration felt it would be wrong to release the papers from Judge Roberts' work as the No. 2 person in the solicitor general's office under Kenneth W. Starr.
Those papers, which are not covered by the Presidential Records Act, record "sensitive, deliberative, confidential" conversations among administration lawyers in developing legal cases for argument before the Supreme Court and therefore should not be released publicly, one of the officials said.
On Sunday, Sen Patrick J. Leahy, D Vt., the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said lawyer client privilege did not apply either to Roberts' work at the Justice Department or to his work at the White House.
Specter and Leahy met Monday to discuss the timing of the confirmation hearings, but still have no agreement, although they appear to be close to reaching agreement.
Just after learning that President Bush planned to nominate federal appeals court Judge John G. Roberts Jr. for a seat on the Supreme Court, NARAL Pro Choice America sent an electronic action alert to its 800000 person network, encouraging members to call their senators and talk to friends about their opposition.
The abortion rights group also sent out 30000 e mails to its activists around the country Tuesday night, outlining talking points explaining its opposition to Roberts, and furnishing sample letters to be sent to local newspapers and background on the nominee.
The group planned to follow that up Wednesday with calls to its 27 national affiliates, keeping them abreast of any new information that emerges about Roberts' record.
Conservative interest groups, meanwhile, voiced strong support for Roberts and began their campaign to support the nominee long before he was announced.
Hours before Bush's announcement, Progress for America staff members were working in the 20th Street studios at Interface Media, preparing a biographical ad supporting the nomination that will be ready to air on cable television within 24 to 48 hours.
"We understand the crucial importance of defining the nominee before the opposition has a chance to," said Jessica Boulanger, the group's director of communications, who said the group is prepared to spend $18 million or more.
"The amount we spend will be dictated by how much the left puts into fighting the nominee."
Groups on both sides have spent years preparing for this moment.
Their legal experts have been poring over the records of close to 20 potential nominees, and organizers have spent countless hours in planning meetings and on conference calls to hone their message.
Also, they have amassed huge war chests to finance television, radio and print ads to define the nominee in the public's mind.
In recent years, both sides have clashed over some of Bush's choices for federal appeals courts, some of which were blocked by Senate Democrats.
But activists on both sides called those minor skirmishes when compared with the battle they anticipate over the first Supreme Court nomination in 11 years.
Raising the stakes is that with the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who has been a crucial swing vote on the court, many liberal activists fear and conservatives hope that Roberts's confirmation would move the court decidedly to the right.
"We're saddened that President Bush has chosen the politics of conflict and division over bipartisan consensus," said Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
Officials at People for the American Way held conference calls with allies throughout the day, as speculation swirled about Bush's choice.
After Bush's announcement, the liberal activist group activated a plan assembled years ago to mobilize opposition to the nominee.
The group zipped e mails to 400000 members asking them to contact their senators, to scrutinize the nominee and, at minimum, not to take a position until after hearings are held.
The Federalist Society, in turn, put together a list of conservative legal experts to advise the media on Roberts and the issues he will face.
"The experts are former Supreme Court clerks or otherwise have special expertise,We believe the experts can help contribute to and enlighten the public discussion," the organization's Web site said.
The public relations firm Creative Response Concepts, which is working with a number of conservative organizations active in the Supreme Court fight, is handling contacts between the experts and reporters.
Jan LaRue, chief counsel to Concerned Women for America, said the conservative group is prepared to gear up a grass roots campaign in support of Roberts if Democrats threaten to filibuster.
"Everything I know tells me he meets the president's criteria very well, he clearly is in the mold of (Antonin) Scalia and (Clarence) Thomas" both conservative justices.
Ending speculations and debates, US President George W. Bush finally announced Tuesday his choice for the vacancy in the Supreme Court left by retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
In a live broadcast TV statement Tuesday night, Bush announced that John G. Roberts Jr., an appeals court judge and a conservative, is his first nominee for the Supreme Court.
Praising Roberts "has a good heart", Bush said the 50 year old native of Buffalo, New York State, has been devoting himself to the "cause of justice" throughout his life.
Roberts, who stood aside when the president was making the announcement, said later that he will fulfill his duty and serve the nation and justice.
Analysts said Bush's choice for the Supreme Court seat will enhance the government's influence in the nine seat highest court where a balance had been kept between four conservatives and four liberals while the outgoing O'Connor stood in the middle.
In his early years, Roberts had served as a clerk for Chief Justice William Rehnquist before he worked in Republican administrations.
He joined the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in May 2003 and has proved his conservative stance when he and two other appeals court judges ruled that war crime trials in the prison at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, could proceed.
The US Supreme Court consists of nine judges, including a Chief Justice and eight Justices.
The highest judicial body holds the ultimate judicial power and can veto any legislation passed by the Congress or any state.
Members of the court can keep their posts for life if they are willing to do so under the condition of no malfeasance.
O'Connor, the only female member of the court, announced on July 1 that she decided to retire, leaving weeks of speculations and debates on who will be Bush's nominee for the court.
President George W. Bush, giving Supreme Court nominee John G. Roberts a White House sendoff Wednesday for the Senate confirmation process, voiced confidence he will get "a timely hearing, a fair hearing" on Capitol Hill.
Early Wednesday morning, Bush's choice to succeed Sandra Day O'Connor on the bench was all grins as he and the president emerged from a private breakfast to stroll before the cameras down the colonnade to the Oval Office.
Pausing for a moment, Bush said conversations with senators the evening before had convinced him that "we're off to a very good start for his nomination" and promised Roberts "all the support that's necessary for the senators to be able to make up their minds."
Bush ignored questions about whether he would talk to Democratic senators who worry that Roberts would push the nation's highest court too far to the right on abortion and other polarizing issues.
"We discussed how important it is for Judge Roberts to get a fair hearing, a timely hearing and a hearing that will bring great credit to our nation," Bush said.
"I wish him all the best."
Roberts headed to Capitol Hill for meetings with leaders in the Senate, which will decide whether he will replace O'Connor and thus become the first new Supreme Court member in more than a decade.
Abortion, indeed, will be a "hot button" issue in the confirmation process, former Sen Fred Thompson, who will shepherd Roberts through the Senate confirmation process, said Wednesday.
Abortion has been legal since a 1973 Supreme Court decision, but remains a controversial topic in the U.S.
But Thompson also said that lawmakers shouldn't read too much into Roberts' seemingly conflicting legal positions on the issue.
"Many of the positions he's taken are positions he took as an advocate ,representing a client," Thompson said on NBC television.
He noted that Roberts had served as a deputy solicitor general a policy advocate in the first Bush administration.
In a brief that Roberts filed with the Supreme Court at that time, he said that the court decision that legalized abortion Roe v. Wade "was wrongly decided and should be overruled."
But he told senators during his 2003 confirmation hearings for his current appellate court post that the decision was "the settled law of the land."
Appearing on CBS television, Thompson added that "one should not confuse a position a good lawyer takes in representing a client with his own personal views."
The nine Supreme Court justices serve in their posts for life or until they decide to retire.
Although they are nominated by the president, they must be approved by the Senate.
Bush introduced the 50 year old Roberts to the nation Tuesday night, calling him a man with "a good heart" and a jurist who will "strictly apply the Constitution in laws not legislate from the bench."
Reaction from Republican senators was overwhelmingly supportive.
Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee called for confirmation proceedings that "treat Judge Roberts with dignity and respect" and lead to a yes or no vote before the court's term begins Oct 3.
Democrats reacted more cautiously, but there were no instant predictions of a filibuster.
"The president has chosen someone with suitable legal credentials, but that is not the end of our inquiry," Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said.
Roberts is a Washington insider who has worked over the years at the White House, Justice Department and in private practice.
After graduating with honors from Harvard Law School, he clerked for William H. Rehnquist when he was an associate justice on the Supreme Court.
It was Rehnquist who presided over the swearing in ceremony when Roberts took his seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
"Before I became a judge, my law practice consisted largely of arguing cases before the court," said Roberts, who met with the president in the executive residence for an hour last Friday.
"I always got a lump in my throat whenever I walked up those marble steps to argue a case before the court, and I don't think it was just from the nerves."
He was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1992 by the first President George Bush and again by the president in 2001.
The nominations died in the Senate both times.
He was renominated in January 2003 and was confirmed by voice vote.
At the time, his nomination to the appellate court attracted support from both sides of the ideological spectrum.
In his four and a half year presidency, George Bush has rarely gone against his conservative instincts and the fundamental interests of his political base.
Tuesday night he stayed true to form, nominating a conservative favorite, appellate court Judge John Roberts, to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Filling the first court vacancy in 11 years the crucial swing vote held by a retiring Sandra Day O'Connor Bush was handed a grand opportunity to make a lasting mark on the closely divided court.
He responded by picking a judge who has been espousing conservative judicial dogma for more than two decades.
Although he has been a judge for only two years, Roberts, 50, has an extensive written record on behalf of Republican administrations, notably on the volatile issue of abortion.
"We continue to believe that Roe was wrongly decided and should be overruled," Roberts wrote in a 1991 Supreme Court brief as deputy solicitor general.
Despite what will be an intense fight, though, there were early hints that Roberts was headed for likely confirmation.
Notably, Bush passed over several candidates who would have made conservative groups even happier.
And Democrats Tuesday night were reacting with marked caution, not fiery condemnation.
Roberts will be no red meat target for opponents.
The president made his pick with gusto, making a rare prime time announcement in a bid to galvanize a nationwide television audience.
"I believe that Democrats and Republicans alike will see the strong qualifications of this fine judge, as they did when they confirmed him by unanimous consent to the judicial seat he now holds," Bush said at the White House.
In the process, Bush touched off what is likely to be a spirited and expensive fight in the U.S. Senate over Roberts' confirmation.
Tens of millions of dollars have been squirreled away in anticipation of a classic Supreme Court battle, and Roberts' appointment makes it likely that much of it will be spent.
In the weeks leading up to Tuesday's pick, a few prognosticators thought Bush might try to head off this battle and offer a consensus appointment that would be in the O'Connor mold.
But Tuesday night he made it clear that his pick would be a change agent.
"He will strictly apply the Constitution and laws not legislate from the bench," Bush said.
As presidents have learned time and again, it's never safe to assume the judicial leanings of a Supreme Court justice newly armed with a lifetime appointment.
But odds are strong that Roberts would align himself with Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice William Rehnquist to form a rock solid conservative core that would need only a single extra vote to make new law a far different alignment from the one that's existed for the last decade.
As a clerk for Rehnquist, then as a lawyer in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and Bush's father, Roberts repeatedly proved his conservative mettle, persuading legions of Republican heavyweights of his judicial orientation.
He also won political points during Bush's contested 2000 victory over Democrat Al Gore, working behind the scenes on Bush's successful case before the Supreme Court.
But given his short stint as appellate judge in the District of Columbia circuit, White House officials contend Roberts will be a tough target for opponents to shoot at, with a thin paper trail of rulings.
Beyond that, Roberts will be buoyed by his reputation as a legal dynamo who has argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court and whose intellectual weight makes him a high court natural.
Crucial to whether Roberts' nomination results into a historic free for all is the reaction of 14 moderate senators who stepped in earlier this year to defuse a bitter Senate fight over Bush appeals court nominees.
If some of the seven Democrats in that group signal that Roberts is acceptable, the Senate battle could cool.
In an early indication, one of the Democrats, Sen Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, told reporters last week that Roberts would be "in the ballpark," making a Senate filibuster against him unlikely.
But holding off the well funded machines that have been established to support, and oppose, any Bush nomination will be a tall order particularly on the issue of abortion.
As deputy solicitor general in 1991, Roberts was co author of an administration brief that said clinics receiving federal money should be prevented from discussing abortion with their patients.
As part of that brief, which was ultimately endorsed by the court, Roberts wrote that the Supreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion "finds no support in the text, structure, or history of the Constitution."
Supporters will argue that Roberts' brief represented the position of his client, the first Bush administration, and not his own view.
Nevertheless, the abortion issue will hang heavily over his confirmation proceedings.
So will the reality that his appointment could dramatically alter the court's course on issues ranging from religious expression to affirmative action.
Bush got plenty of advice over how he could make his mark in his first Supreme Court nomination.
His wife urged him to appoint a woman.
Minority groups suggested he appoint the court's first Latino.
But the president had his own agenda.
Notwithstanding the Iraq war, his first term tax cuts and his Social Security plan, changing the fundamental balance of power on the Supreme Court could be the president's biggest legacy.
And early indications are that Roberts, a young man who could serve on the court for decades, will put him on course toward that goal.
Sunni Arab Muslims protested Tuesday a raid by US forces on a Baghdad mosque reportedly linked to the kidnapping of a US reporter.
About 700 people rallied in the gardens of the Umm al Qura mosque in the west of the capital to denounce the raid carried out Saturday night by US and Iraqi forces.
"This raid was conducted as a direct result of a tip by an Iraqi civilian that activities related to the kidnapping were being carried out inside the mosque," said Lieutenant Colonel Barry Johnson, speaking of the abduction Saturday of Christian Science Monitor reporter Jill Carroll.
Her interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, 32, was shot dead and his body abandoned nearby by the kidnappers, while her driver got away.
"Both Iraqi and coalition Forces raided the mosque in the early morning hours in order to minimize the impact on worshippers and the surrounding neighborhood," the military spokesman said.
Six people were detained for questioning, he added.
The Sunni Committee of Muslim Scholars, which is based at the mosque, confirmed that one of its members, Yunis Aikali, and five mosque guards were arrested in the raid.
In a statement, the committee also accused US soldiers of desecrating the mosque and carrying away files containing the names of members.
"The attack on the Umm al Qura mosque is an attack on Muslims and Islam," said banners held up by protesters at Tuesday's rally which followed morning prayers.
"We call on the occupiers to withdraw from Iraq because they are the reason for every crime and the death of every innocent in Iraq," Harith al Aubaidi, a member of the scholars' committee, said in his sermon at the prayer meeting.
"There can be no stability as long as Iraq is occupied," he added.
The UN special representative in Iraq, Ashraf Qazi, also deplored the raid.
"This again underlines the importance of all parties respecting the sanctity of holy sites and places of worship," he said in a statement.
Carroll, 28, a freelance reporter working for the Christian Science Monitor, was seized by gunmen on Saturday after calling by the office of a prominent Sunni politician in the neighbourhood.
"We are urgently seeking information about Ms Carroll and are pursuing every avenue to secure her release," said Monitor editor Richard Bergenheim.
Carroll's driver, quoted in a story posted on the Monitor's website, said gunmen jumped in front of the car, pulled him from it, and drove off with their two captives all within 15 seconds.
Several Westerners are currently being held hostage by insurgents in Iraq, including an American, a Briton and two Canadians who are members of a Christian peace group.
Carroll was the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group Reporters without Borders.
Iraqi and US investigators were hunting Tuesday for a US journalist kidnapped in Baghdad as a French hostage who escaped after five weeks of captivity in Iraq arrived back in France.
Jill Carroll, 28, a freelance reporter working for the Christian Science Monitor, was seized by gunmen on Saturday after calling by the office of a prominent Sunni politician, the US newspaper confirmed on Monday.
Her interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, 32, was shot dead and his body abandoned nearby by the kidnappers, while her driver got away.
The incident was reported by AFP on Saturday, but the agency, in common with other foreign and US news outlets, did not identify Carroll in line with a Monitor request as efforts were launched to find her.
"We are urgently seeking information about Ms Carroll and are pursuing every avenue to secure her release," said Monitor editor Richard Bergenheim.
Carroll's driver, quoted in a story posted on the Monitor's website, said gunmen jumped in front of the car, pulled him from it, and drove off with their two captives all within 15 seconds.
Several Westerners are currently being held hostage by insurgents in Iraq, including an American, a Briton and two Canadians who are members of a Christian peace group.
Carroll was the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group Reporters without Borders.
Five of the kidnap victims four Iraqis and Enzo Baldoni of Italy were killed by their abductors.
The others were released.
Frenchman Bernard Planche, a 52 year old engineer, managed to evade his captors on Saturday.
He landed at late Monday at a military base in France where he was met by his daugher and niece, along with Foreign Minister Philippe Douste Blazy.
Blanche, who escaped from a farmhouse west of the capital, said he was "delighted to return to civilisation and to French soil."
The hostage developments followed a twin suicide bombing against the Iraqi interior ministry that killed at least 28 policemen.
The Iraqi branch of Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack in an Internet message, saying it was to avenge the "torture" of Sunni Muslims in interior ministry facilities.
Abuse scandals came to the fore in November and December when US and Iraqi forces discovered two overcrowded interior ministry detention centres.
Some inmates had reportedly been tortured.
Meanwhile in Washington, the White House Monday denied that the US government has been negotiating with insurgents and Saddam Hussein loyalists in Iraq, but acknowledged that it was reaching out to those who until now have rejected the political process.
"Part of our strategy, a critical element of our strategy, is to broaden participation in the political process," White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters.
"We have been reaching out to the rejectionists."
The spokesman was reacting to a New York Times report Saturday that said the United States has stepped up contact with some Iraqi insurgent groups in a bid to exploit tensions between home grown rebels and foreign militant groups such as Al Qaeda.
Washington wants to encourage the Sunni Arab minority to join in a government of national unity in a bid to undermine Sunni support for insurgents and allow for the start of withdrawal of US led coalition forces.
In addition to the human cost of the war, with 2209 US servicemen killed and over 16000 wounded, the Iraq war will likely cost the United States anywhere between one and two trillion dollars, according to a new study co authored by a Nobel Prize winning economist.
The research made public Monday by Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University, a 2001 Nobel Prize laureate and former chief economist at the World Bank, and economy professor Linda Bilmes of Harvard University, argued that current official assessments of the war cost fail to consider key expenses likely to dog the US budget for years to come.
The family of Jill Carroll, a US woman journalist abducted in Iraq, issued an emotional appeal Monday for her release after her captors threatened her with execution.
"Jill is an innocent journalist and we respectfully ask that you please show her mercy and allow her to return home to her mother, sister and family," Carroll's family said in a statement.
Earlier, the Qatar based Arabic television station Al Jazeera showed a videotape of Carroll taken by her kidnappers, who said they would kill her if female prisoners in Iraq were not freed within 72 hours.
Carroll, 28, a freelance reporter working for the Christian Science Monitor, was seized by gunmen in Baghdad on January 7.
Her interpreter was shot dead during the abduction, while her driver got away.
"Jill is a kind person whose love for Iraq and the Iraqi people are evident in her articles," the family statement said.
"She has been welcomed into the homes of many Iraqis and shown every courtesy.
From that experience, she understands the hardships and suffering that the Iraqi people face every day," it said.
"Jill is a friend and sister to many Iraqis and has been dedicated to bringing the truth of the Iraq war to the world."
Carroll was the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group Reporters without Borders.

Angry Sunni Arabs protested Tuesday at a raid on a Baghdad mosque by US and Iraqi soldiers looking for a kidnapped US woman reporter, the latest victim in a series of abductions of Westerners in Iraq.
The demonstration came as Iraqis celebrated the Muslim Eid Al Adha holiday a day after a twin suicide bombing at the interior ministry, claimed by Al Qaeda, that left at least 28 policemen dead.
Waving banners and chanting anti US slogans, about 700 people rallied in the gardens of the Umm al Qura mosque in the west of the capital to denounce the Saturday night raid.
"The attack on the Umm al Qura mosque is an attack on Muslims and Islam," read one of the banners at the protest.
The US military said the raid was linked to the hunt for kidnapped Jill Carroll, a freelance journalist working for the Christian Science Monitor.
Lieutenant Colonel Barry Johnson, a US military spokesman, said the raid was ordered "as a direct result of a tip by an Iraqi civilian that activities related to the kidnapping were being carried out inside the mosque."
The 28 year old reporter was seized by gunmen on Saturday after calling by the office of a prominent Sunni politician in the neighbourhood.
Her interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, 32, was shot dead and his body abandoned nearby, while her driver got away.
"Both Iraqi and coalition forces raided the mosque in the early morning hours in order to minimize the impact on worshippers and the surrounding neighborhood," Johnson said.
Six people were detained for questioning, he added.
The Sunni Committee of Muslim Scholars which is based at the mosque, confirmed that one of its members, Yunis Aikali, and five mosque guards were arrested in the raid.
In a statement, the committee also accused US soldiers of desecrating the mosque and carrying away files containing the names of members.
"We call on the occupiers to withdraw from Iraq because they are the reason for every crime and the death of every innocent in Iraq," Harith al Aubaidi, a member of the committee said in his sermon at the prayers ahead of the protest.
Ashraf Qazi, the UN special representative in Iraq, also deplored the raid.
"This again underlines the importance of all parties respecting the sanctity of holy sites and places of worship," he said in a statement.
Iraqi security forces, meanwhile, were on alert in western Baghdad looking for hostages, security sources said.
The US embassy said it had nothing new to report on Carroll.
The Christian Science Monitor said it was urgently seeking information about its reporter after confirming her abduction on Monday.
Carroll's driver, quoted in a story posted on the Monitor's website, said gunmen jumped in front of the car, pulled him from it, and drove off with their two captives all within 15 seconds.
Several Westerners are currently being held hostage by insurgents in Iraq, including an American, a Briton and two Canadians who are members of a Christian peace group.
Carroll was the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group Reporters without Borders.
Five of the journalist kidnap victims four Iraqis and Enzo Baldoni of Italy were killed by their abductors.
The others were released.
Frenchman Bernard Planche, a 52 year old engineer, held hostage for over a month and who managed to evade his captors on Saturday, was debriefed Tuesday by the DGSE foreign intelligence agency at a base near the Loire Valley city of Orleans.
In other developments, a Polish soldier was wounded and two rebels killed during a raid carried out by coalition forces near the town of Hamza, south of Baghdad, Poland's PAP news agency reported Tuesday.
Coalition forces captured four suspects wanted over the killing of a Spanish officer in 2004.
In Baghdad, two policemen were killed and two wounded in separate shooting incidents Tuesday, security officials said.
In Spain itself, police arrested 20 people across the country, mostly Moroccans, suspected of recruiting radical Islamist volunteers to fight in Iraq, national radio said.
In the United States, a new study co authored by a Nobel Prize winning economist, claimed that in addition to the human cost of the war, with 2209 US servicemen killed and over 16000 wounded the Iraq campaign will likely cost the United States anywhere between one and two trillion dollars.
An Arab television network ran a video showing kidnapped journalist Jill Carroll Tuesday with an accompanying message from her unnamed captors that she would be killed unless the United States freed all female prisoners in Iraq within 72 hours.
The group holding Carroll captive was not identified in the tape that was broadcast over Al Jazeera.
Although the 28 year old Christian Science Monitor reporter appeared to be talking on the tape, her words were not audible.
Carroll was kidnapped Jan 7 while on assignment and her captors had made no public comment or demand until the tape was shown Tuesday.
Her translator was shot dead but her driver was set free.
Her family issued a statement Tuesday afternoon pleading for "the speedy and safe return of our beloved daughter and sister."
"Jill is an innocent journalist and we respectfully ask that you please show her mercy and allow her to return home to her mother, sister and family," read the letter signed by her parents Jim and Mary Beth Carroll and her sister Katie.
"Jill is a friend and sister to many Iraqis and has been dedicated to bringing the truth of the Iraq war to the world."
News organizations withheld details of her abduction for several days to allow time for her newspaper and family to seek her release.
David Cook, her newspaper's Washington bureau chief and spokesman, said that the paper has had no contact with the kidnappers.
In the 20 second tape, Carroll was shown against a white background and appeared reasonably healthy, although tired.
An Al Jazeera news reader said that the network has appealed for Carroll's release.
U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the Bush administration was continuing "to make every effort" to free Carroll.
The Christian Science Monitor newspaper on Monday pleaded for the release of American reporter Jill Carroll, seized in Baghdad by abductors who gunned down her Iraqi translator.
Carroll, 28, a freelancer filing for the Boston,Massachusetts based paper, was abducted in western Baghdad on Saturday, apparently on the way to interview a prominent Sunni politician.
"We are urgently seeking information about Ms Carroll and are pursuing every avenue to secure her release," said Monitor editor Richard Bergenheim.
"The Monitor joins Jill's colleagues Iraqi and foreign in the Baghdad press in calling for her immediate and safe release," the paper said in a statement which named Carroll for the first time.
The incident was reported from Baghdad by AFP on Saturday, but the agency, in common with other foreign and US news outlets, did not identify Carroll in line with a Monitor request as efforts were launched to find her.
Carroll had reported from the Middle East for Jordanian, Italian and other news organizations for the last three years, the paper said.
"In recent months, the Monitor has tapped into her professionalism, energy, and fair reporting on the Iraqi scene," the Monitor statement said.
"It was her drive to gather direct and accurate views from political leaders that took her into western Baghdad's Adil neighborhood on Saturday morning."
The paper quoted unidentified relatives of Carroll as pleading for her release and asking her captors to "consider the work she has done to reveal the truth about the Iraq war."
In a dispatch for the American Journalism Review published last year, Carroll wrote that she moved to Jordan ahead of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 to get a feel for the story.
"All I ever wanted to be was a foreign correspondent," she wrote.
"So when I was laid off from my reporting assistant job at the Wall Street Journal in August 2002, it seemed the right time to try to make it happen.
"There was bound to be plenty of parachute journalism once the war started, and I didn't want to be a part of that."
Officials in Baghdad and the Monitor said Carroll was seized as she was on her way to interview prominent Sunni Arab politician Adnan al Dulaimi.
The body of her interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, 32, was later found in the same neighborhood.
An Iraqi defence ministry official said Enwiyah was able to tell soldiers that Carroll had been kidnapped before he died.
Carroll's driver, quoted in a story posted on the Monitor's website on Monday, said gunmen jumped in front of her car screaming "Stop!
Stop!
Stop!" and others jumped in and surrounded Carroll and Enwiyah.
"They didn't give me any time to even put the car in neutral," the driver, who requested anonymity, said.
"It was very obvious this was by design.
The whole operation took no more than a quarter of a minute.
It was very highly organized.
It was a setup, a perfect ambush."
A guard outside Dulaimi's office told AFP on Saturday he heard gunshots fired a short distance away and rushed to find the body of a slain man.
Dulaimi however told AFP he had no appointment to meet a Western journalist.
Several Westerners are currently being held hostage by insurgents in Iraq, including an American, a Briton and two Canadians who are members of a Christian peace group.
Carroll is the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group Reporters without Borders (Reporters sans Frontieres, or RSF).
Five of the kidnap victims four Iraqis and Enzo Baldoni of Italy were killed by their abductors.
The others were released.
RSF renewed its call for Carroll's release on Monday, and bemoaned the dangers faced by reporters in Baghdad.
"Journalists working in Iraq have once again been caught in a deadly ambush," the group said in a statement.
"The interpreters death confirms that the Iraqi press continues to be the chief victim of the infernal climate for the media in this country."
The Christian Science Monitor on Monday named a US journalist kidnapped in Iraq as freelancer Jill Carroll, who was on assignment for the US based paper when she was seized.
Carroll was abducted in western Baghdad on Saturday, by kidnappers who killed her Iraqi interpreter, the paper said in a statement, calling for her release.
The incident had previously been reported from Baghdad, but Carroll had not been identified.
The family of an electrical contractor believed killed by a militant group in Iraq is convinced he is dead, and is preparing a memorial service.
The Islamic Army of Iraq claimed that it killed Ronald Schulz last month, and a video on a Web site, purportedly posted by the group, showed a blindfolded man being shot in the back of the head.
His face was not shown and it was impossible to verify his identity.
The video also showed Schulz's identity card.
While U.S. officials have not confirmed Shulz's death, his sister, Julie Schulz, said Tuesday night that the family identified him from two videos reportedly posted by the group.
"Although his face was not visible, there are enough consistencies between the two videos and enough evidence that my family, in our hearts, believe that Ron is dead," Schulz said.
"We had hoped his body would be found so that we could bring him home.
But this has not happened."
The family is planning a memorial service on Jan 14.
Shulz, 40, was working as an electrical contractor when he was kidnapped.
Insurgents have kidnapped more than 250 foreigners in the past two years, aiming to force U.S. led troops to leave Iraq or prevent Arab nations from strengthening their ties with the Baghdad government.
Most recently, Jill Carroll, an American freelance reporter, was kidnapped in Baghdad shortly after she was leading office of a leading Sunni politician.
No claim of responsibility has so far been issued in Carroll's case.
Arabic television Al Jazeera said Tuesday the kidnappers of a US woman journalist abducted in Baghdad had threatened to kill her if female prisoners in Iraq were not freed within 72 hours.
The station broadcast a brief videotape of the journalist Jill Carroll, 28, a freelance reporter working for the Christian Science Monitor who was seized by gunmen in Baghdad on January 7.
Carroll, wearing a grey sweatshirt with her long brown hair loose, was shown alone in the video and speaking but there was no sound.
It was the first time she has been since since her disappearance.
The Qatar based station said the kidnappers identified themselves as members of a previously unknown armed group calling itself the "Brigades of Vengeance".
"Al Jazeera reiterates its rejection and condemnation of all forms of violence targeting journalists, and demands the release of the US journalist Jill Carroll," the station said.
Carroll's interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, 32, was shot dead and his body abandoned nearby by the kidnappers during the abduction, while her driver got away.
US forces have been hunting for the woman, and one day last week raided a mosque in the west of the capital after a tip that "activities related to the kidnapping were being carried out inside," triggering angry protests from Sunni Muslim clerics.
"We are urgently seeking information about Ms Carroll and are pursuing every avenue to secure her release," Monitor editor Richard Bergenheim said last week.
Carroll's driver, quoted in a story posted on the Monitor's website, said gunmen jumped in front of the car, pulled him from it, and drove off with their two captives all within 15 seconds.
Several Westerners are currently being held hostage by insurgents in Iraq, including an American, a Briton and two Canadians who are members of a Christian peace group.
Carroll was the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group Reporters without Borders.
Five of the kidnap victims four Iraqis and Enzo Baldoni of Italy were killed by their abductors.
The others were released.
Frenchman Bernard Planche, a 52 year old engineer, managed to evade his captors on the very day Carroll was abducted.
The mother of a US journalist abducted in Iraq made an impassioned plea for her release Thursday as the clock ran down on a threat by the kidnappers to execute her daughter.
Mary Beth Carroll said a video of her daughter Jill taken by her captors had given the family hope that she was still alive, though it "has also shaken us about her fate."
Jill Carroll was seized by gunmen in Baghdad on January 7.
They have threatened to kill her on Friday unless all Iraqi women in US military custody are released.
"I, her father and her sister are appealing directly to her captors to release this young woman, who has worked so hard to show the suffering of Iraqis," Carroll's mother said, reading the family's prepared statement on CNN television.
"Taking vengeance on my innocent daughter, who loved Iraq and its people, will not create justice.
To her captors, I say that Jill's welfare depends upon you, and so we call upon you to ensure that Jill is returned safely home to her family, who needs her and loves her."
Carroll also pleaded with the captors to "work with Jill to find a way to contact us with the honorable intent of discussing her release."
On the video broadcast Tuesday by the Al Jazeera Arabic television station, the 28 year old freelance reporter, wearing a grey sweatshirt, with her long brown hair loose, was shown alone and speaking, but there was no sound.
It was the first time she had been seen since her disappearance.
In Iraq on Wednesday, a justice ministry official said that six Iraqi women detainees were to be freed in the coming days.
US forces had earlier said they were holding eight Iraqi women because they presented "an imperative threat" to the security of Iraq.
Jill Carroll arrived in Iraq in 2003 and worked for a variety of news organisations from several different countries.
She began filing stories for the Christian Science Monitor, her current newspaper, early last year.
Her mother told CNN that Jill had traveled to the region to get a sense of the terrain and the culture ahead of the war.
"We could see the war was coming in Iraq, and she didn't want to be a parachute journalist, somebody who just comes in ,quickly.
She wanted to get to the Middle East early, learn about the people of Iraq, learn about the culture and the customs and the politics, so she could report well and accurately."
She said they had also discussed the possibility of her being kidnapped.
"I told her frankly how I felt if she would be kidnapped, and supporting her and knowing that she was doing what she loved and what she thought was very important to do, and that that would give me and her family comfort at this time and it does," Mary Beth Carroll told CNN.
She added: "I think she was a wonderful ambassador, is a wonderful ambassador, to the United States" for the Iraqi people.
"We know she's a strong woman and that her strength of character and her mind will get her through this," she said.
The Islamic Party, Iraq's main Sunni Arab party, called Thursday for Carroll to be released "as quickly as possible" and condemned "the abduction of innocent people."
A similar appeal came from the Washington based Council on American Islamic Relations, which said it was sending a delegation to Baghdad to make a public plea for Carroll's release.
"No cause can be served by harming those who only seek to convey the human suffering caused by war," the organisation said in a statement.
According to the media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, Carroll is the 35th media worker to be kidnapped in Iraq since the start of the war.
Five of the kidnapping victims four Iraqis and Enzo Baldoni of Italy were killed by their abductors.
The others were all released safe and sound.
Muslim leaders and her pleading mother appealed Thursday for the release of kidnapped American journalist Jill Carroll as Iraqi officials said six detained Iraqi women were due for release by the U.S. military, a condition set by the hostage takers who are threatening to kill their captive.
But the White House said no prisoner release appeared imminent and a major Sunni Arab clerical group said it could do little to help win Carroll's freedom because it did not know who was holding her.
The kidnappers of 28 year old Carroll, identified as the previously unknown "Revenge Brigade," have given until Friday evening for all Iraqi female detainees to be freed or they would execute her.
However, Iraqi kidnap groups often set such deadlines only to ignore them and continue holding captives.
New images showing Carroll surrounded by three armed and masked gunmen were aired Thursday by the Arab TV station Al Jazeera.
The 20 seconds of silent footage were from a tape of which excerpts were broadcast Tuesday with the 72 hour deadline.
Carroll's mother said the video images gave her hope that her daughter is alive but also have "shaken us about her fate."
"I, her father and her sister are appealing directly to her captors to release this young woman who has worked so hard to show the sufferings of Iraqis to the world," Mary Beth Carroll told CNN's "American Morning."
Iraq's deputy justice minister, Busho Ibrahim Ali, said six of the eight Iraqi women in custody are expected to be released next week, but he stressed that any release would "not be part of any swap with any kidnappers."
"I insisted that the Americans should bring (the women's) files and release them and they will be freed next week along with other detainees," Ali told Associated Press Television News.
He did not elaborate on who the other detainees were, but said the recommendation to free the women was made Monday.
Speculation that the Iraqi women may soon be freed raised hopes for the release of Carroll, a freelance journalist who was working for the Christian Science Monitor when she was seized Jan 7 in western Baghdad.
Her translator was killed.
U.S. military officials repeatedly refused Thursday to confirm whether any release was imminent.
In Washington, White House press secretary Scott McClellan said the Bush administration was working hard to secure Carroll's freedom but said no Iraqi detainees were expected to be released soon, citing information from the U.S. Department of Defense.
"Any time you have an American held hostage, wherever they are, they are a priority for the administration," McClellan said Thursday.
"And we want to see her safe return.
As I indicated yesterday, too, I don't think it's really helpful to go beyond that at this point."
Carroll grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and received an journalism undergraduate degree in 1999 from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
She worked as a reporting assistant for The Wall Street Journal before moving to Jordan and launching her freelance career in 2002, learning Arabic on the way.
Her newspaper's Washington bureau chief, David Cook, also urged the captors to contact them to discuss her release.
Cook would not say specifically if the newspaper would pay ransom.
"I think our policy would be that we would welcome contact from the captors," Cook told NBC.
"Either the family or the Monitor would be eager to talk to the captors."
Calls for Carroll's freedom were also made by Muslim leaders in Iraq plus a team of U.S. based Islamic advocates traveling to the Middle East to seek her release.
The Washington based Council on American Islamic Relations flew to the Jordanian capital, Amman, on Thursday and was planning to hold a news conference Friday in Baghdad.
The group said it hopes to reach Arab television audiences and persuade Carroll's captors to release her.
The Bloomfield Hills based Islamic Shura Council of Michigan, which represents about 20 Muslim groups in the state, told the Detroit Free Press that Carroll's kidnapping would not help the Iraqi cause.
In Iraq, leaders of three prominent Sunni Muslim groups demanded Carroll's release.
Iraq's insurgency draws the bulk of its support from Iraq's once dominant Sunni Arab community, which fell from grace once its Sunni benefactor, Saddam, was toppled.
"We condemn the abduction of journalists who are a means to convey the truth to the people," said Muthana Harith al Dhari, spokesman for the Association of Muslim Scholars, which is believed to have ties to some Sunni insurgent groups.
However, al Dhari, who is considered a hard liner in the association, said there was little that his group could do because it did not know who was holding her.
French journalist and former hostage Florence Aubenas, who was released in June after being held hostage in Iraq for 157 days, also called on Carroll's hostage takers to release her.
"She came to this country to do her job as a journalist and not anything else," Aubenas told Al Jazeera.
Carroll's mother said her daughter even discussed with her family the possibility of being kidnapped in Iraq, a country where more than 240 foreigners have been kidnapped and at least 39 killed since the 2003 U.S. led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.
"Those things have been said.
And she knows that we love her and support her," Mary Beth Carroll said on CNN.
"She knows that we can be strong for her."
The Pentagon said Thursday the release of female detainees from US military run facilities in Iraq is not imminent despite threats by kidnappers to kill an American journalist held hostage.
Kidnappers on Tuesday threatened to kill 28 year old freelance reporter Jill Carroll if the United States failed to meet a 72 hour deadline to free all female prisoners.
"I don't have any information on any imminent releases," said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman.
Iraq's justice ministry said Wednesday that six of eight women detainees held by US forces would be released within days, but it denied there was any link with the kidnappers' demands.
"I have no insight on that," Whitman said.
He said fewer than 10 Iraqi women were held in facilities run by the US military in Iraq.
He said Iraqi US review boards periodically assess whether prisoners, male or female, no longer pose a threat and should be released.
In Baghdad, a US military spokesman said some female detainees may be released "in accordance with the normal process."
"But they won't be released as a response to a demand by terrorists and criminal agents," said Brigadier General Donald Alston.
"We don't negotiate with terrorists and criminals."

US Senator John Kerry told US television Thursday that the fate of kidnapped US journalist Jill Carroll has overshadowed his visit to Iraq, becoming one of top issues discussed at his meetings with senior Iraqi officials.
The former Democratic presidential candidate, on a 12 day trip to Asia and the Middle East, told CNN television that he has held numerous discussions with top Iraqi officials in Iraq, including President Jalal Talabani, at which the fate of the missing US newspaper journalist was raised.
"Every single effort possible that can be made is being made to try to locate her, to try to find out what is going on ,to try to deal with this issue," Kerry said, as the clock ran down on a threat by kidnappers to execute Carroll.
"This young reporter, by all reputation over here in Baghdad, is somebody who has the interest of the Iraqi people at heart," he said.
Carroll was seized in Baghdad on January 7, by gunmen who threatened to kill her on Friday unless all Iraqi women in US military custody are released.
"My thoughts have been with her every single minute that I've been here," Kerry said from Baghdad.
"It's hard to be here and know that this is going on," he said.
The Democratic senator is on a tour of several countries, including Iraq and Afghanistan, to assess progress in the US "war on terror".
His itinerary also includes Pakistan, Jordan, Kuwait, Israel and India.
Six Iraqi women detainees are to be freed soon following a review of their case, a justice ministry official said Wednesday, as the captors of a US woman journalist demanded all female prisoners be freed.
"The decision has been taken and these detainees will be released in the coming days," according to the official who declined to be named.
US forces had earlier said they were holding a total of eight Iraqi women detainees because they presented "an imperative threat to the security of Iraq.
"All detainees have their cases reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether conditions still warrant their internment as security threats," the military added.
On Tuesday, Al Jazeera television showed a videotape of Jill Carroll taken by her kidnappers, who issued an execution ultimatum saying the US reporter would be executed within 72 hours if Iraqi women detainees were not set free.
The justice minister had asked in the past for the commission reviewing the cases of detainees to speed up its work on the women, the ministry official said.
"We asked that they either be charged or freed, and no proof has been found to implicate them in acts of violence," the official said.
The commission is comprised of representatives of the justice, interior and human rights ministries, and members of the US led military coalition.
Carroll, 28, who works for the Boston based Christian Science Monitor newspaper, was seized on a Baghdad street on January 7 by gunmen who shot dead her interpretor.
More than 12000 Iraqis are currently detained by coalition forces.
JILL CARROLL'S BRAVERY TO A WORLD increasingly suffused with media, the kidnapping of Jill Carroll in Baghdad is a reminder of the dangers that journalists face in the most dangerous war zone on earth and of the importance of foreign correspondents in explaining distant places to Americans.
Iraqi gangs, which seize foreigners because they are easy targets, harm their country by restricting the flow of information to the rest of the world.
By all accounts Carroll, a freelance writer on assignment for The Christian Science Monitor, has felt a deep sympathy for Iraqis.
She was learning Arabic, liked the food, and moved about with minimal protection.
She was visiting a dangerous neighborhood in Baghdad on Jan 7 to interview an Iraqi politician when her translator was killed and she was kidnapped.
Somebody with her sensibilities, willing to take risks, is just the kind of reporter that is needed to explain the turbulence in Iraq to Americans.
It is no surprise that the abduction has been denounced by many Iraqis.
Even some among the Sunni community, where opposition to the US invasion is highest, have come out against the kidnapping.
"We condemn the abduction of journalists, who are means to conveying the truth to people," Muthana Harith al Dhari, a spokesman for the Association of Muslim Scholars, said.
Accurate information about Iraq is of vital importance to Americans as they consider how long US troops should stay there.
The Iraqi perspective is best obtained from reporters with a toe in both cultures.
Beginning with the US invasion in 2003, 60 journalists have been killed in Iraq, making it by far the most dangerous place on earth to be a reporter.
One of them was Elizabeth Neuffer, foreign correspondent for the Globe, who died in an auto accident in the early stages of the conflict.
The danger has worsened as journalists have become targets by design instead of happenstance.
The Committee to Protect Journalists reports that most of the dead are Iraqi, doing their best to find the news in a society riven with violence.
The latest casualties reported on the committee website were Mohammed Haroon, a journalist once affiliated with the Saddam Hussein regime, and Firas Maadidi and Hind Ismail, reporters for a prodemocracy newspaper.
These journalists, had they lived, would have provided information and shaped opinions that could have promoted peaceful change in Iraq.
The men who abducted Carroll apparently have a different purpose to sow fear among news people.
Doing journalism in Iraq is a tough, exhausting, and dangerous craft.
Not to do it, however, would leave communication about the struggle of its people to the gunmen and suicide bombers.
An American Muslim advocacy group is traveling to the Middle East to plead for the safe return of a journalist facing death at the hands of her kidnappers.
The Council on American Islamic Relations is planning to hold one news conference Thursday in Amman, Jordan, and another Friday in Baghdad.
The group hopes to reach Arab television audiences and convince the captors of Jill Carroll, a freelancer for the Boston based Christian Science Monitor, to release her.
"We're taking a serious step on behalf of our community, and we are hopeful that our words will be heard and our appeal will be listened to," said Nihad Awad, executive director of CAIR.
"We have been reading about her work ,and though we don't know her, we know it is wrong to kidnap people and hurt innocent people."
Carroll, 28, was kidnapped Jan 7 in one of Baghdad's most dangerous neighborhoods.
She was being driven to meet a Sunni Arab politician, who failed to appear for the interview.
Carroll's translator was killed, but her driver escaped.
The group claiming responsibility has threatened to kill Carroll on Friday unless all Iraqi women in military custody are released.
A U.S. military spokeswoman, Sgt. Stacy Simon, said eight Iraqi women are currently detained.
She provided no further details.
White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Wednesday that Carroll's "safe return is a priority" and he did not want to talk about it further because of the sensitivity of the situation.
CAIR, based in Washington, works to promote a positive image of Islam and Muslims in the United States.
Iraq's main Sunni Arab party called Thursday for the release of US journalist Jill Carroll after her captors had threatened to kill her if Iraqi women prisoners are not freed.
"We call on the kidnappers to release the reporter as quickly as possible," the Islamic Party said in a statement which also condemned "the abduction of innocent people".
Carroll, a 28 year old reporter working for the Boston based Christian Science Monitor, was snatched from a Baghdad street on January 7 by gunmen who shot dead her interpreter.
On Tuesday, the Qatar based Arabic television station Al Jazeera showed a videotape of Carroll taken by her kidnappers, who issued an ultimatum saying they would execute their hostage unless the United States freed all Iraqi female detainees within 72 hours.
Iraq's justice ministry said Wednesday that six of eight women detainees held by US forces would be released within days, but it denied there was any link with the kidnappers' demands.
A leading US based Islamic rights group on Wednesday announced it was sending representatives to Baghdad seeking the release of Jill Carroll, the US journalist abducted in Iraq.
Carroll's captors have threatened to kill her unless the United States freed all female prisoners in Iraq within 72 hours.
On Tuesday, the Qatar based Arabic television station Al Jazeera showed a videotape of Carroll taken by her kidnappers, who issued their execution ultimatum.
The Washington based Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) said in a statement that because of the short deadline its delegation will hold a press conference late Thursday in Amman "to make a public appeal to the kidnappers for Carroll's freedom."
CAIR also plans a press conference in Carroll's home state of Michigan with local Muslim leaders to call for her release.
The group plans a second press conference in Baghdad on Friday, the statement added.
CAIR earlier issued a statement translated into Arabic and distributed to Middle Eastern media outlets calling for Carroll's "immediate and unconditional" release.
Carroll, 28, arrived in Iraq in 2003 and has been filing stories for the Christian Science Monitor newspaper since early last year.
Carroll was seized by gunmen in Baghdad on January 7.
Her interpreter was shot dead during the abduction, while her driver got away.
The sharing of Robert F. Kennedy Stadium by Major League Soccer champion D.C. United and the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball has resulted in a soccer pitch that isn't rectangular.
"It's clearly not acceptable, but we understand that it's been a challenge for everybody, and we just have to be patient," United president Kevin Payne said Tuesday.
"Nobody wants the field to be off."
Officials at United's 4 3 home loss to New England on Saturday filed a report with MLS saying the field was lopsided.
Two officials measured the field by walking it, and they determined that one corner to corner diagonal was about 6 meters longer than the other.
"It's unscientific, but the referees are pretty good at measuring by walking it off," MLS spokesman Dan Courtemanche said.
Even once that's fixed, there's another issue: the way the grass is mowed.
Right now, the pitch is set up in such a way that the lines cut in the outfield grass for the baseball team are at an odd angle for United games.
Normally for soccer, grass is mowed perpendicular to the sidelines, which helps officials by giving them a straight line against which to judge offside calls.
"It is sort of an optical illusion, confusing to everybody," Payne said.
"It's very hard on the linesmen."
One possible solution would be to change where the soccer field is set up, putting it parallel to the Nationals' first base line.
But that would mean the soccer field would have to be smaller, something Payne doesn't want.
"We certainly believe that everything will be worked out," Courtemanche said.
D.C. United and the Nationals are sharing RFK, a venue used for the 1994 World Cup and frequently a site of U.S. World Cup qualifiers, until 2008 while a new baseball stadium is being built.
When the soccer team plays, the baseball mound is lowered, and the infield dirt is covered with temporary turf.
Pitchers have had problems with the mound, which will be stripped down and rebuilt with new clay next week.
The problem with the possible misalignment of the field's shape was first reported by The Washington Post.
No doubt RFK Stadium will exude considerably more baseball charm on a night when the humidity isn't a thousand percent.
That's not a typo.
If 100 percent humidity is the point at which we start growing gills, then there has to be an exponentially higher scale of measurement when a dorsal fin appears and one starts developing a taste for bait.
But hot teams make for hot times.
The Washington Nationals, having won seven in a row and 10 of 11 before last night, and the Mariners, as hot as they've been all season, clashed for the first time ever last night, and the most remarkable aspect may be that no one swooned until the seventh inning.
Perhaps it was the humidity and a threat of thunderstorms that kept the D.C. crowd under 30000 less than two thirds of RFK's stated capacity of 45250 for baseball.
Perhaps Mariners Nationals isn't quite the same as Red Sox Cubs on the marquee of interleague matchups.
Or perhaps this place just doesn't get it yet.
Yeah, it's still early.
And school isn't out yet.
And the Nationals are the first team to play regularly in the nation's capital since Watergate was just an apartment complex.
So maybe we should cut the fans some slack for not being up to speed on recent developments.
Besides, the Nationals have virtually no season ticket base, given that the former Montreal Expos had probably less notice of their new situation than 20 percent of the General Motors work force will soon be getting.
Still, if a team is brand new in a town that supposedly has been thirsting, nay, lusting for major league baseball these past 34 years, and it's in first place and playing extremely well, shouldn't the crowds be bigger?
Certainly if the Mariners were in the Nationals' position first place in a division where every team is playing above .500 Safeco Field would be hosting thousands more than the 33718 fans Seattle has averaged at home through 29 dates this year.
That figure, by the way, puts the Mariners third in average attendance in the American League behind the Yankees and Angels, and fourth (behind the Red Sox, Yankees and Angels) in percentage of stadium capacity.
Through 31 dates, the Nationals are averaging about 2000 fewer at RFK, admittedly not one of the prime drawing cards as stadiums go.
Opened in 1961 as District of Columbia Stadium, one of the first multipurpose venues in the much copied soup tureen style that was all the rage for a generation, the Nationals' ballpark is indeed the team's best argument for the new half billion dollar home it wants.
Washington's football fans may have a soft spot for the place, but as a baseball park RFK is soulless, charmless and utterly unremarkable in its bland symmetry.
To which all real baseball fans should respond with a unanimous "so what?"
It shouldn't, absolutely shouldn't, be the stadium that matters.
Yet we've all been conditioned, not just by Major League Baseball but by every "brand" making a pitch for our attention, that packaging comes before content.
As a result, we lose perspective.
Consider, for example, that the 26 33 Mariners are the statistical equal, sometimes the better, of the 35 26 Nationals.
In batting average the Mariners are 12th of 14 American League teams, the Nationals 16th of 16 National League teams, in total hits, the Mariners are 13th, the Nationals 10th, in home runs, the Mariners are 13th, the Nationals 16th, in on base percentage, the Mariners 11th, Nationals 12th, in ERA, the Mariners eighth, Nationals seventh, in strikeouts by pitching staff, Mariners 14th, Nationals 15th, and in opponents' batting average, Mariners fourth, Nationals sixth.
Even after walking seven Nationals in the final two innings of last night's 9 3 loss, the Mariners, seventh in the AL in walks, have walked fewer batters than the Nationals, who are 11th in the NL.
What to make of all this?
"I honestly have no clue what anyone should take from that," said Mariners manager Mike Hargrove.
Hargrove is right not to read too much into numbers that are made malleable by many variables between leagues and even divisions within the leagues, not to mention the vicissitudes of the schedule.
Nevertheless, Seattle fans can appreciate there's not much difference statistically between the Mariners and a team that, for the moment, is a contending ballclub.
A bounce here, a break there, and the Mariners are maybe three games out of first place.
That their fans have responded so well despite a losing record this season is worth noting, though it's likely many of those fans are showing up because Safeco Field is a nice ballpark.
We'll never know how many fans the Mariners would draw if they played in a place like RFK Stadium, but I'd be willing to bet a decline of 5000 per game.
Which makes it imperative that they realize, at 26 wins and 33 losses, just how incredibly lucky they are.
For years, Washington hungered for a baseball team.
Now it has one, and a winning team at that.
But in a city where politics courses through the veins of the inhabitants where Republicans run the show and the man in the White House is himself a former baseball team owner it was probably too much to expect the Washington Nationals to usher in a bipartisan era of peace, love and understanding.
Sure, James Carville, the Democratic political consultant, can be spotted at games sitting in the same row as Andrew H. Card Jr., President Bush's chief of staff.
But now that George Soros, the billionaire liberal philanthropist who spent millions trying to defeat Bush last year, is competing for ownership of the team against bidders who include the likes of Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state, and Peter Fitzgerald, a Republican former senator, the mood on Capitol Hill isn't exactly Mom and apple pie.
Some Republicans went so far as to suggest that baseball could lose its antitrust exemption if it permits Soros, who would be a part owner with a group of investors headed by a local entrepreneur, to sign on a threat that immediately drew ridicule in the sports pages and outrage from Democrats.
By Wednesday, one Republican, Rep Tom Davis of Virginia, had backed away from that suggestion, saying he never intended any threat.
But Davis and other Republicans did not back down from their criticism of Soros who, they took pains to note, has been convicted of insider trading in France (a ruling he is appealing) and has supported ballot initiatives to legalize medical marijuana.
"We finally got a winning team," Davis said.
"Now they're going to hand it over to a convicted felon who wants to legalize drugs and who lives in New York and spent 5 million dollars trying to defeat the president?
How's he going to get him out to the opening game?
C'mon."
As if the feud over team ownership is not enough, the Nationals appear to be creating a sartorial quandary for some.
Certain Democrats, it seems, are feeling queasy about wearing the team's signature "W" caps, which evoke reminders of a certain former owner of the Texas Rangers whose middle initial just happens to be W.
The Washington Nationals finished their opening homestand tied for first place.
It can't get much better than that.
"We have a whole new outlook," catcher Brian Schneider said.
"Now anything seems possible."
Nationals players are obviously happy to finally have a true home after going virtually unwatched as the vagabond Montreal Expos the past two seasons.
But many questions remain about this team and baseball's future in the nation's capital.
With a payroll still under $50 million, the Nationals aren't likely to be able to stay in contention all season in the difficult National League East, and the newness of the sport's return after 33 empty summers will soon wear off.
Despite a face lift, RFK Stadium remains a relic that is far from fan friendly, and a new stadium on the banks of the Anacostia River not far from the Capitol won't be ready until 2008 at the earliest.
Meanwhile, the Nationals remain wards of Major League Baseball.
Commissioner Bud Selig says that he expects a sale to go through by midseason.
Earlier, the speculation was that it would be completed by May.
MLB bought the team for $120 million three years ago and hopes to sell it for triple that amount.
So far, eight groups have said that they are interested in buying the Nationals.
One is headed by Stan Kasten, the former president of the Braves, Hawks and Thrashers.
"I'd like to see him get it," Braves manager Bobby Cox said during his team's two game series at RFK.
"I think it would be good for baseball.
I was hoping he might be around while we were here."
Most of the prospective ownership groups are keeping a low profile.
That certainly isn't the case with the return of baseball to Washington, however.
President Bush threw out the ceremonial first pitch and more than 600 media members were on hand as the Nationals won their home opener 5 3 over Arizona before a sellout of 45596 at RFK Stadium.
"It was like a World Series," rookie outfielder Ryan Church said.
The Nationals swept the three game series with the Diamondbacks before losing twice to Florida and then splitting with the Braves.
All the crowds were larger than the best for the Expos last season, but the dip from the opener was dramatic considering that the Nationals have a season ticket base of about 22000.
"We just need to keep winning," said coach Tom McCraw, a player on the last Washington Senators team in 1971.
"That's the only way to keep people excited."

Aaron Harang allowed only one single in 6 1 3 innings and D'Angelo Jimenez had a pinch two run double in the Cincinnati Reds' 6 1 victory for a three game sweep of the New York Mets on Thursday.
With a combined four hitter, the Reds' record improved to 3 0 for the first time since 1990.
They last swept the Mets at home in 1995.
However, the Mets hadn't lost their first three games since 1964, their third year in existence.
Harang completed the sweep with one of the best performances of his career, allowing only three walks and Ramon Castro's second inning single before letting the bullpen take over.
The Mets failed to get an extra base hit.
Harang topped Kazuhisa Ishii, who allowed only two costly hits over 6 2 3 innings.
Wily Mo Pena hit a solo homer in the second, and Jimenez's double sparked a three run rally in the seventh.
Nationals 5, Phillies 4, 10 innings In Philadelphia, Jose Vidro led off the 10th inning with a homer, leading the Washington Nationals to their second straight win.
Vidro had three RBIs and Brad Wilkerson continued his torrid hitting, going 4 for 5 a day after hitting for his second career cycle.
Washington, which moved during the offseason after 36 years as the Montreal Expos, completed its first series by winning two of three.
The Nationals play their home opener at RFK Stadium on April 14 against Arizona.
Vidro hit a 1 2 pitch off Rheal Cormier (0 1) into the left field seats to start the 10th.
Chad Cordero (1 0) pitched two scoreless innings for the win.
As the Washington Nationals left the field with their 12th consecutive home victory on Saturday night, the sound system at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium played the theme music from "The Natural," a movie about mystical and magical occurrences in baseball.
Livan Hernandez, the starting pitcher who raised his record to 11 2, had taken the same walk to the dugout in the previous inning and waved his red cap to the 39881 customers applauding him.
Now, Marlon Byrd, the left fielder who was also cheered, was congratulated by his teammates for his two hits, his two runs batted in, his stolen base, his throw to cut down a runner at second base and his diving catch.
But Byrd got more than pats on the back when his teammate Jose Guillen sneaked up and smacked his face with a pie made of shaving cream.
"It means you played a good game," Byrd said with a smile over the blast of salsa music coming from the clubhouse stereo.
"I hope to get a whole bunch of those."
The Nationals have played many good games in this surprising season, their first here.
Despite a 9 5 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays on Sunday, Washington is in first place in the National League East, three games ahead of Atlanta.
Despite modest hitting the Nationals are second to last in the majors in runs they use pitching, defense and the managing of Frank Robinson to win, often coming from behind.
"A lot of people don't believe in this team," Hernandez said, referring to those outside Washington.
"I like it like that, because you can show people."
He recalled playing in Canada last season, when the team was the Montreal Expos and fans were few at Olympic Stadium.
"It's good when you've got 40000 people screaming for you," Hernandez said.
"It's different than 5000 people.
Everybody is happy about the fans and wants to say, 'Thank you."'
Hernandez and the Expos spent last season in last place while playing most of their home games in the province of Quebec and some of them in the territory of Puerto Rico.
Now they are thriving in the District of Columbia, but their franchise transfer still has many loose ends.
The team is still owned by Major League Baseball, which bought it for $120 million in 2002 and is brokering a sale among nine bidders.
The Nationals play in a 43 year old stadium that has many problems, including vandalism and theft from some players' cars in the parking lot when the team was on the road last week.
"Somebody's got to do a little better job," said Byrd, whose Cadillac Escalade was stolen.
Referring to other problems including long concession stand lines and turf disfigured by the Major League Soccer team that is a co tenant Tony Tavares, the team president, called RFK "an old dog."
"We've put a lot of lipstick on this pig, but people have fun," he said.
President Bush and Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state, were among the 110127 who attended the three game weekend series and pushed the season attendance total to 1166717, the ninth highest in the NL.
According to Major League Baseball, sales of merchandise bearing the Nationals' brand are among the top five of the league's 30 teams, even though the merchandise was introduced after the Christmas season, the peak period for such sales.
With a new stadium expected to open in 2008 and a location in the prestigious market of the nation's capital, the franchise could be sold for as much as $400 million.
Despite legal problems that limit their television exposure, a scattered and inconsistent radio network, a low payroll and few star players, the Nationals are outdrawing the Baltimore Orioles, their American League neighbors, who are about 40 miles away.
The Nationals are averaging 32409 fans a game, the ninth most in the NL.
The Orioles, despite spending most of the season in first place in the AL East, are averaging 30756, down from 33165 at the same point last season, when their team was not as successful.
Monica Pence, the communications manager of the Orioles, said it was too early to judge the impact of competition in overlapping markets.
"We feel we've already said all we wanted to say," she said.
"We expressed concern the Nationals would have a negative impact on our revenue and attendance."
The Nationals have already surpassed the single season attendance record of the old Washington Senators, who drew 1027216 fans in 1946.
They could threaten the Expos' best attendance of 2320651 in 1983.
Last season, the Expos drew 748587.
The Nationals' interleague games against Toronto this season were vestiges of the teams' geographic rivalry, developed when both were based in Canada.
The Expos' transfer was approved late last fall, and the schedule was already made.
Next season, the Nationals and the Orioles will play each other in their respective parks.
But, even with the Nationals in first place, skeptics wonder whether MLB will be able to sell the team quickly, have a new stadium built with public money and maintain two viable teams in the region.
How will the commissioner's office handle the finances this summer if the Nationals want to make trades to compete for a postseason spot?
Bob DuPuy, the president and chief operating officer of MLB and the overseer of the Nationals, said the commissioner, Bud Selig, hoped to have a "firmer feel" about the sale of the team before the All Star Game break, in about two weeks.
"You're never convinced a stadium is a sure thing until they throw the first pitch of the first game," DuPuy said.
"We've said all along there's room for two teams in that marketplace."
The Nationals' payroll of less than $50 million is among the lowest 25 percent in the majors, according to Tavares.
DuPuy said, "I would expect they will have" more money to spend because a profit of $20 million is projected this season.
Jim Bowden, the general manager of the Nationals, was more emphatic.
"There's no question that if the right deal is out there, we'll be able to increase payroll to get the piece to win," he said.
He added: "This is a great defensive team, one of the best defensive teams in the league, and one of the best bullpens.
And when you have pitching and defense, you usually win pennants.
We have that combination, and we are getting the breaks."
Bowden said Nick Johnson, the first baseman and cleanup hitter, "is having his breakout year," with 8 home runs, 42 RBI and a .320 batting average.
He said Ryan Church, who injured his shoulder Wednesday when he crashed into a wall while making a game ending catch in Pittsburgh, was a contender for rookie of the year, he is batting .325.
Chad Cordero, who leads the majors in saves with 25, said: "We like to be under the radar, but I think a lot of people are noticing now.
They're taking us seriously."
Robinson, a Hall of Fame player who was baseball's first black manager 30 years ago in Cleveland, is a serious man.
He will turn 70 on Aug 31, and his patience is short with many people, including pitchers who disagree with his maneuvers.
Tomo Ohka was one who objected, and he was traded for doing it.
"I can rub the players the wrong way," Robinson said.
But he has helped the team win by arguing successfully with umpires for a reversal of an opponent's home run and by challenging the pine tar on the glove of an opposing pitcher, as he did with Brendan Donnelly of the Los Angeles Angels two weeks ago.
When Angels manager Mike Scioscia confronted Robinson over Donnelly's ejection, Robinson challenged Scioscia, who is 23 years younger.
"I wasn't going to let him intimidate me," Robinson told reporters a day after the incident.
"I am the intimidator."
The managers' confrontation prompted Guillen to rush to Robinson's support in what almost escalated into a fight.
Since then, Guillen has broken out of a slump.
He twice hit two homers in a game last week, and he gave the Nationals a 2 1 lead in the third inning Sunday by diving home headfirst on an infield grounder.
"Jose is a very emotional kid," Robinson said.
"That may have got his adrenaline flowing a little more."
Guillen leads the team in home runs with 15 and is batting .301.
In nine major league seasons, he has played for seven teams, often leaving behind hard feelings.
"He's been given a bad rap," said Bowden, who traded for him.
"The guy's a winner.
He's emotional."
Now, like his new franchise, Guillen seems to have ceased his wandering and landed in a comfort zone.
The Nationals have the best home field winning percentage in the majors, .722.
Guillen, referring to the pie in the face celebration, said: "Winning is always fun.
You always try to do something to make the players happy.
Trust me, this happens only when you win and you have the year we're having.
So far, so good."
c. San Francisco Chronicle The Washington Nationals take some getting used to, from the tip of their caps (stolen from the second incarnation of the Senators) to the bottoms of their pseudo old school uniforms with the blocky block lettering and numerals (stolen, as near as we can tell, from the late 1950s Packers).
Indeed, when you think of how, as the Montreal Expos, they were systematically starved to death to make the Nationals possible ,well, you have a built in rooting interest for the new team to fail miserably.
But then you look at manager Frank Robinson, face of the franchise, and the kind of guy who does the Hall of Fame honor by letting himself be included, and with all that, you come to the realization that rooting for the Nationals might not be such a bad idea after all.
Or that when they finally do blow up, that he's well on his way to his next job.
Robinson is the living embodiment of baseball's conscience, of the class of African Americans who saved the game from its own smothering sterility and did so despite the most revolting racial inequities.
He took plenty, but gave back every bit of it and then some.
It is his intention to hand out a bit more to the Giants in this weekend's three game set that begins this evening.
Robinson was fun to watch as a player, fun to watch as a manager and even fun to watch when he was disciplining players for on field brawls.
In short, he just looks as baseball ought to want to look 69 going on 53, and looking ahead rather than behind because ahead still has the chance to be really interesting.
The Nats (a lame enough nickname, but exactly what you should get when you think "Nationals" evokes any kind of civic emotion) are still the Expos in every way but one they are playing in a new town.
The old one was a perfectly good baseball town treated badly by a series of bad owners, the last ones being the other 29 owners.
A decade ago, the Expos dealt away nearly the entire contents of what had been a superbly productive farm system, and replaced those contents with, well, nothing.
Even now, they are a fairly faceless lot, with the most recognizable name for local consumption being the mighty ex Giant and a half Livan Hernandez.
Robinson coaxed a couple of winning seasons out of the strip mined Expos before it all caved in last year, and a new challenge, however manufactured, has always worked for him.
In Cleveland, where he was not only the first African American manager but the man who came closest to carrying off the Indians' ridiculous all red uniforms, he took a bad team and drove it toward the middle of the standings.
In San Francisco, he took a hideous team and got it to win.
In Baltimore, he took a horrendous team and improved it by 32 wins in a season.
This is Robinson's fourth year with the Nats, and when he completes it, he will have finally managed the same team for four consecutive years.
If it continues at its current pace, this team will bring him 85 wins, give or take.
The Nats are an odd team in that they don't seem to have a readily definable shape.
Hernandez is the team's best pitcher by a margin as wide as his ,well, let's give that analogy a break for once.
The batting order has been more productive than its name recognition factor, which is good news both for veterans seeking a home such as Jose Guillen and Vinny Castilla, and Expo lifers such as Brad Wilkerson and Brian Schneider.
You, of course, don't care that much.
Your favorite team has a bullpen by convention, a left fielder who sends cryptic notes over the Internet while he recoups from what seems to be an endless series of knee surgeries, and a predilection for beating up on the harmless and losing 2 of 3 to everyone else.
The Washington Nationals mean next to nothing to you.
But credit must be awarded to teams, and men, who deserve it, and Frank Robinson remains on scholarship with anyone who has ever paid attention to the game.
Even his time in San Francisco helped set up the team for its run of glory in the late '80s.
So forgive him his uniform, and the tale of shame that helped make the Nationals possible.
Ignore the future, which as likely as not will have the Nats as a sick franchise struggling for attention in a football town.
Just look at the manager.
He may seem like a dinosaur, but the meteor hasn't yet hit the Earth that could make him extinct.
He is too smart, too headstrong, too wise to limp in.
Trust us on this Frank Robinson has plenty of miles left on the warranty.

It took 33 years for baseball to return to Washington, Nationals fans hope it will not take that long for most of them to see the team's cable TV games.
Nearly halfway through the season, the Nationals' games on the Mid Atlantic Sports Network, or MASN, are not being carried by Comcast and are seen only by consumers served by RCN Cable and DirecTV.
The dispute is almost identical to the one that kept the YES Network off Cablevision's systems in the New York metropolitan area from 2002 to early 2003.
Games are being blacked out in a large portion of the market.
One side (Comcast) is suing the other.
And one party (the Baltimore Orioles) has embarked on an advertising campaign to trump its rival.
But there are twists that make the Nationals' case more complex.
The Nationals are pawns in events they had no say in, that as the wards of Major League Baseball they could not influence.
The Nationals' television predicament is a result of the compensation package that kept Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner, from suing to block the Montreal Expos' move to Washington.
One part of the agreement gave him 90 percent ownership of (a stake that will be reduced to 67 percent, 1 percent a year for the next 23 years), with baseball owning the rest (or selling it to whoever buys the Nationals). will not carry Orioles games until 2007, but it began showing the Nationals in April.
So here is a network mostly owned by one team, carrying the games of a second team it did not want in its market, but doing so as part of a sweetheart deal under which baseball will also guarantee the value of the Orioles if Angelos sells.
Now that is Moneyball.
A total of 81 Nationals games will be on local broadcast stations this season and 76 on MASN.
For their troubles, the Nationals are guaranteed about $20 million in annual rights fees from MASN, not bad for an innocent bystander in a legal war.
As happy as the deal might have made Angelos, it displeased Comcast, which, in addition to being the largest cable operator in the United States and the dominant one in the Orioles and the Nationals' market, owns all or part of various entertainment and sports networks, including four Comcast SportsNets.
One of those sports networks has the rights to carry Orioles games through the 2006 season.
Comcast has refused to carry and alleged in a lawsuit filed in county circuit court in Maryland that the Orioles' deal with baseball violated its rights to match third party offers for the team's cable rights beyond 2006.
"Comcast is trying to protect its monopoly," said Bob Whitelaw, the executive vice president and general manager of MASN.
"It's that simple.
They're the only regional network in the area, and they've stated publicly that a market with 6.6 million cable households doesn't need another regional sports network."
It is odd, he said, that Comcast started the second regional sports network in Chicago, and is an investor and the operating partner in the Mets' new network, which will start next year and be the fourth one in the New York market.
The Orioles went on the offensive earlier this month.
In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, they accused Comcast of violating cable law by showing preference to Comcast SportsNet by not carrying a competitor.
The Orioles also charged that Comcast illegally sought equity in to carry it and intimidated rival cable companies into not making deals with it.
The Orioles insist that Comcast's right to match competing offers has not been violated, because no outside bids were made, or solicited, for the cable games.
The team's reasoning stems from the mid 1990s, when Angelos created TCR, a television company that sold Orioles cable rights to Home Team Sports, which Comcast eventually acquired knowing that after the 2006 season, those rights would revert to the Orioles, which could do as they pleased with them.
The Orioles argue that is the fruit of forward legal thinking: that it is not a new network, but a successor to TCR, with a new brand name.
And, if is not new, but a reinforced TV company into which baseball is investing $75 million, then Comcast's right to match an outside bid was not set off.
It is elegant thinking, and maybe, in Comcast's view, a fancy subterfuge around the definition of a new network.
A Comcast spokeswoman declined to comment.
Comcast's problem with the Orioles is a lengthy legal detour from the mostly happy tale of the Nationals, who lead their division with a 44 31 record, and whose cable games have been held hostage to the battle between Angelos and Comcast.
Fans are frequently irrelevant in these disputes, which come down to money.
Comcast wants leverage and may view the Nationals as fruit from a poisoned tree, so why carry them?
And if Comcast is as ornery as Cablevision, disenfranchised Nationals fans may have to wait until next year's opening day to see their team on local cable.
The Washington Nationals are on pace to earn a pre tax profit of $20 million this season, reversing the fortunes of one of baseball's biggest economic underperformers during the past decade and increasing the potential value of the franchise as Major League Baseball attempts to sell it, according to Nationals officials and people involved in the sale.
The projected profits are fueled by robust attendance, strong sponsorship and television deals, and one of the lowest player payrolls in baseball.
The Nationals have swung from a $10 million loss last year as the Montreal Expos into the top half of teams, ranked on the basis of revenue and profits, according to people who closely follow baseball economics.
"I think $20 million might be conservative," said Andrew Zimbalist, who teaches economics at Smith College and writes frequently about baseball.
"If they go to the postseason, you can add another $5 million or $10 million.
And when they get the new stadium, it will go up even more."
The team's financial success could play a major role in determining the Nationals' sale price.
MLB, which bought the franchise for $120 million in 2002, has received eight bids, most of them believed to be between $300 million and $400 million.
MLB officials say they hope to reach a decision on a new owner this summer and are currently interviewing prospective buyers.
Most MLB teams sell for between two and three times their revenue, according to investment bankers, so the Nationals' projected revenue of approximately $129 million this year could push the sales price to $400 million or more.
"It could end up toward the high end of the range," said Scott Levine, a sports team valuation expert and director at Stout Risius Ross Inc., a Detroit based financial advisory firm.
Levine said he thinks the price also could go higher given what he called "the ego factor" among the bidding groups.
"You are dealing with people worth billions of dollars," he said.
"To some extent, this is an expensive toy."
The Nationals play in 44 year old Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, which seats 45250 and has none of the cash generating amenities such as club seats and luxury suites modern sports stadiums and arenas feature.
Washington has pledged to build a $535 million stadium along the Anacostia River in return for baseball's decision to move the team here.
Some sports experts cautioned that the Nationals' financial success could be fleeting.
"You went from a greatly depressed market in Montreal to one where pent up demand was dramatic," said David Carter, who teaches sports business at the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business.
"Where you will really be able to tell how financially successful this team will be is in the next several years, where we find if the revenue numbers are sustainable."
"They are enjoying every bit of their honeymoon, but everything looks great when you are in first place or within striking distance of first place," said Raul Fernandez, one of the partners in the MCI Center sports complex, which includes the arena and the Washington Wizards, Capitals and Mystics.
"But building great franchises takes dedication, effort and smart moves over a longer period of time than half of a season."
Nationals President Tony Tavares, who declined to comment publicly on specific revenue numbers, said he had counted on the excitement over baseball's return to Washington after a 34 year absence when he calculated his projections on how the franchise would fare financially in its first season in the city.
He might not have counted on the team being in first place in the National League East Division this late in the season, which could also spur attendance.
The Nationals, who this month surpassed the 1 million mark in attendance, are averaging 31912 tickets sold per game, 13th highest in the league and one spot ahead of the Baltimore Orioles, who are selling 30756 tickets per game, according to league statistics.
That puts the Nationals on track to sell about 2.5 million tickets this year.
With about 22000 season tickets sold per game, at an average price of $24 per seat, plus an average walk up crowd of more than 8000 per game, Washington will generate nearly $60 million at the gate this year after local taxes.

Jerry Bush remembers the day baseball died as if it were yesterday, not 34 years ago, not a lifetime ago.
It was Sept 30, 1971, at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, the final game for the Washington Senators before their hated owner, Robert Short, moved the team to Arlington, Texas, to become the Rangers.
With two outs in the top of the ninth and the Senators ahead, hundreds of angry, frustrated, memento hunting fans piled onto the field, raced around the bases and tore numbers off the scoreboard.
Bush, a 17 year old high school senior at the time, pulled up a chunk of emerald sod and kept it in a shoe box in his bedroom for years.
Over the next three decades, he flirted with other teams: the Orioles, the Yankees.
But like a scorned lover who just can't get over it, none of them stuck in his heart.
None until this year.
On Thursday, Bush will join 45500 other fans at RFK Stadium for the sold out home opener of the newly minted Washington Nationals, formerly the Montreal Expos, who have brought baseball back to this baseball starved city.
"I'm getting goose bumps when I hear the name Nats on the radio," said Bush, a middle school technology teacher in Montgomery County, Md., who unashamedly wears his Nationals baseball cap and jersey to school some days.
In this buttoned down city of transients, power brokers and the politically obsessed, giddy displays of nostalgia are not the norm.
But baseball has a way of doing that to grown men and, occasionally, women.
"Everywhere I go, people stop me to talk baseball," said City Councilman Jack Evans.
"They yell from cars.
They grab me at meetings.
I see people wearing the hats all over the city.
At a Ward 7 event on Friday, two dozen people, mostly men 40 and over, said how proud they were to have a team back."
Never mind that few here can name more than a player or two on their new team.
Never mind that the club drew just 748550 fans in Montreal last year, when it finished last in the National League East with a 67 95 record.
Never mind that the Nationals' hat features a lone "W" above the bill, an uncomfortable reminder to some people in this overwhelmingly Democratic city of their Republican president.
A new day has dawned in a new city.
The Nationals are 5 4 and tied for first in their division.
The honeymoon has begun.
While the common folk buy team T shirts and hats, the rich and powerful have been buying up behind the dugout seats.
Already, the Nationals have sold more than 22000 season tickets, prompting confident team officials to project total attendance of 2.5 million for the year.
"The good news is we haven't had to aggressively market the team yet," said Chartese Berry, the Nationals' vice president for communications.
"We were just absolutely bombarded by folks who were interested."
The home opener will have all the trappings of a Washington event.
President George W. Bush once a part owner of the Texas Rangers will throw out the ceremonial first pitch, using the final ball from the final Washington Senators game, which they forfeited to the Yankees because the fans stormed the field.
There will be a flyover of military jets.
And Chris Matthews plans to tape his Thursday edition of "Hardball" on MSNBC from the RFK field.
This being Washington, protests are also expected.
Parents who want the city to spend money on schools instead of a new baseball stadium.
Advocates seeking congressional voting rights for the city.
(Washington has only one non voting seat in the House.)
Critics of President Bush.
Opponents of the war in Iraq.
(The Nationals are trying to negotiate a deal to let the National Guard advertise and recruit at the stadium.)
"I think Robert Kennedy would appreciate that," Mayor Anthony Williams, whose entire public schedule on Thursday will involve baseball events, said of the protests.
The big question for marketing gurus and baseball fanatics alike is how long the love affair will last.
Could one abysmal Expos like season kill it?
It may come down to people like Jim Mauro.
A Pittsburgh native who has lived in Washington for 25 years, he has continued to cheer for his beloved Pirates.
This year might be different.
At an Orioles game in Baltimore this month, Mauro, a lawyer, glanced up at the scoreboard and noticed that the Phillies were leading the Nationals.
And he noticed something else: a pang of dismay with his new home team.
"It was an epiphany," said Mauro, 60, the president of a youth baseball league in northwest Washington.
"I felt like I was becoming a Nationals fan.
And I felt guilty about the Pirates."
Major League Baseball on Wednesday rejected as "wholly unacceptable" a stadium financing plan approved the day before by the Washington City Council, throwing into grave doubt the city's plans to bring the former Montreal Expos here next season.
Baseball's statement came in response to legislation the Council approved late Tuesday night requiring that half of the riverfront stadium's projected $280 million construction costs be paid for privately, delivering a stinging rejection of a deal struck by Mayor Anthony Williams and baseball officials to finance the ballpark almost entirely with tax dollars.
On Wednesday, a grim Williams expressed pessimism that his plan could be salvaged.
"I do think baseball is in jeopardy," he said.
"The dream of 33 years is now close to dying."
Critics of Williams' plan said he was exaggerating the threat that Major League Baseball would take the team, renamed the Nationals, to another city.
They said baseball had few alternatives, since the Nationals are scheduled to play next season in Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington while their new home is built.
Once the team is in Washington, the city's negotiating position will be strengthened, they argued.
But in a statement, Bob DuPuy, president of Major League Baseball, called the legislation "wholly unacceptable" and gave the city until Dec 31, the previously agreed upon deadline, to approve the original financing deal.
After that date, baseball said, it will begin considering other sites.
"The legislation approved by the District of Columbia City Council last night does not reflect the agreement we signed," the statement said.
DuPuy said baseball had stopped promotional activities for the Nationals and would refund deposits for season tickets.
Under the deal Williams reached with baseball owners to bring the Expos to Washington next spring, less than 20 percent of the stadium would have been financed by private funds, specifically through rent payments from the team.
Amid the uncertainty, the one clear thing on Wednesday was the stark and surprisingly forceful message the Council sent about growing public resentment toward the high cost of sports stadiums.
With land acquisition and service improvements, Williams had projected that the total stadium package would cost $440 million.
But the city's chief financial officer has put the cost closer to $535 million, and other estimates have gone higher.
Cox News Service WASHINGTON On the day when Washington's new baseball team won its first exhibition game, President Bush honored Jackie Robinson in a congressional ceremony on Wednesday and welcomed the champion Boston Red Sox to the White House.
The ceremony marking the Red Sox first World Series win since 1918 was an upbeat event despite political overtones.
Pitcher Curt Schilling, who presented Bush with a team jersey, campaigned for the president last year.
But team executives backed Massachusetts Sen John Kerry.
John Henry, a Kerry backer and the team's principal owner, was ill and skipped the event.
Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein also endorsed Kerry, saying last year, "It's been four days and I'm finally starting to believe the Red Sox won the World Series and I still can't believe George Bush is president of the United States."
Epstein attended the White House south lawn event, but sat with the audience instead of joining the team and Bush on stage.
Massachusetts Sens Kerry and Ted Kennedy, two of Bush's harshest critics, attended the event, though Kerry was late in arriving from the Robinson ceremony at the Capitol.
Bush spotted Kerry as he arrived.
"Good to see you," Bush told his former foe.
"I like to see Senator Kerry, except when we're fixing to debate.
If you know what I mean."
Bush, former managing partner of the Texas Rangers, greeted the Red Sox with a jab aimed at the fact that they had not won the championship since 1918.
"So, like, what took you so long?" he joked, noting that Woodrow Wilson was president the last time the Red Sox won the World Series.
Bush praised the Red Sox for their hustling style of play and touted their organization for its long standing charitable programs, including The Jimmy Fund.
Just before welcoming the team to the White House, Bush participated in a Congressional Gold Medal ceremony for the late Robinson, the first black to play in Major League Baseball.
"This is a guy who inspired little 7 year olds to dream of wearing 42 and dashing for home in Brooklyn," Bush said, "and a 7 year old like me hoping to get his Topps baseball card, even though I was a Giants fan."
"He was an amazing guy.
And his story was powerful then and it is powerful today," Bush said.
The baseball events came as the Washington Nationals, who moved to the city from Montreal during the off season, defeated the New York Mets 5 3 in their first exhibition game in Florida.
Bush is expected to throw the ceremonial first pitch when the Nationals play their first regular season home game on April 14.
The name of a prominent Democrat will also be associated with that game.
The Nationals will play in Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, named for the late Democratic senator and attorney general.
Ken Herman's e mail address is khermancoxnews.com
The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post: It is time for Major League Baseball to stand up to Peter G. Angelos.
Mr Angelos, majority owner of the Baltimore Orioles, has used the threat of litigation and a flair for brinkmanship to cast a pall over the start of Washington baseball's first season in 34 years.
The city's new team, the Nationals, begins regular season play Monday, with a home opener set for April 14, and it remains without a deal to televise its games.
Whatever the local enthusiasm for the Nationals and it appears to be enormous the absence of a television broadcasting outlet is an impediment that will undercut early attempts to market the new team and give it a running start.
This is unacceptable, and it is largely the doing of Mr Angelos.
Mr Angelos opposed bringing baseball to Washington on the grounds that it might further damage his Orioles franchise, whose fortunes have nose dived in the 12 years since he purchased the team.
In that he may have a point, last week, the Orioles reported that ticket sales were running 12 percent behind last year's level.
He has insisted that Major League Baseball should compensate him for the revenue he believes the Nationals will leech from the Orioles.
According to published reports, he has already received from baseball officials a guaranteed minimum price of $365 million should he decide to sell the Orioles.
That's more than twice the amount Mr Angelos paid for the franchise in 1993 not bad for a team whose attendance has plummeted on his watch.
If baseball officials want to indemnify Mr Angelos for his anticipated financial losses, that's fine but not if the compensation would come at the Nationals' expense.
Yet with negotiations in the eleventh hour, the Orioles' owner has insisted on a prejudicial television broadcasting arrangement that would hold the Nationals' financial fortunes hostage to his own whims indefinitely.
Claiming a highly dubious exclusive right to broadcast all baseball in this region, Mr Angelos says Nationals games could be shown on his own Orioles regional network, in return for airing its games, he says he would offer the Washington team a "fair and appropriate fee" but not an equity stake in the network or a percentage of broadcast profits.
In fact, such a deal is a rip off that would deflate the Nationals' value and imperil the task of finding a buyer for the franchise an orphan that is now the collective property of baseball's 29 team owners.
What prospective Nationals' owner would cede control of broadcasting rights to a rival to say nothing of a rival as truculent as Mr Angelos?
Might as well trade away the team's best sluggers and star pitchers.
Mr Angelos has threatened to sue unless he gets his way.
Evidently hoping to avoid the drawn out, bare knuckled litigation for which he is notorious, baseball officials have kept negotiations alive.
But the talks have gone on for six months, and time's up.
The season starts next week, and Washington's baseball starved fans want to tune in.
Lawyers say Mr Angelos's legal position is weak.
It's time for Major League Baseball to fix a sensible broadcasting deal for the Nationals whether or not Mr Angelos will play ball.
The Washington Nationals will make their debut in the nation's capital when they host the New York Mets in a major league baseball exhibition game on April 3.
The game will be played at RFK Stadium, which will serve as the Nationals' temporary home before their new stadium is constructed.
Formerly the Montreal Expos, the Nationals were officially relocated to Washington last month.
After the move was approved the team's future in the District of Columbia briefly seemed in jeopardy when stadium funding hit a snag, but local officials have since approved a plan for public funding of a 400 million dollar stadium.
Major League Baseball owners Friday conditionally approved the relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington for the upcoming season.
The approval was "subject to all conditions set forth in the Baseball Stadium Agreement," signed by the Expos and Washington Mayor Anthony Williams.
The agreement calls for the District of Columbia government to enact funding for a new ballpark by December 31.
"This is another important step in finalizing the relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington DC," baseball commissioner Bud Selig said.
"We are looking forward to finishing the last few steps, including the sale of the ballclub, and the rebirth of the club as the Washington Nationals."
The last time a major league club moved cities was after the 1971 season, when the Washington Senators became the Texas Rangers.
Until a new ballpark is built, Washington will play at RFK Stadium.
Still without approval from baseball club owners or the city they plan to call home, the Washington Nationals were born Monday in a sea of red, white and blue.
These are not your grandfather's Washington Nationals, because those Nationals played in the American League and were alternately called the Senators.
The new National League Nationals were named not only before they have approval to play in the nation's capital, but also before they have a new owner.
Major League Baseball, the owner of record, has moved so slowly on the transfer and the sale of the team that a new owner isn't guaranteed to be in place in time to make marketing plans for next season or to have a say in off season player decisions.
For what some people expect to be $400 million to $500 million, the new guy doesn't get to name his team.
"We need a name for marketing," Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, said Monday.
"We're not going to have an owner for some time.
What if we don't have an owner by the start of spring training?"
Nearly 30 individuals or groups have submitted expressions of interest in buying the team.
Baseball expects about half of that number to bid seriously when the time comes to put up their money.
One owner said Monday that he believed the leading contender for the team was Mark Broxmeyer, a Long Island builder, but another hopeful said there was no way anyone could be a leading contender because the first dollar hasn't been bid.
If there is a leader in the bidding, having nothing to do with finances, it could be the group headed by Stan Kasten, who for many years was the president of the Atlanta Braves.
Kasten has been exploring multiple opportunities in multiple sports, but if he decides to reach for the Nationals, he would have an advantage over other prospective buyers.
Why?
Study recent baseball history.
The winning bidder for the Boston Red Sox three years ago was John Henry's group, which was loaded with baseball people who had a close relationship with Commissioner Bud Selig.
He might not have known it at the time, but Cablevision's Charles F. Dolan never really had a chance.
Kasten has had a good, long relationship with Selig.
The Washington bidding will be a show worth watching.
Not long after Major League Baseball took control of the Expos, baseball people talked about an eventual sale bringing in $400 million, giving the other 29 teams a rewarding payday for their $120 million purchase.
Then the economy turned south, and some people felt baseball would be fortunate to get $200 million.
Maybe that's why baseball officials dragged their feet in deciding where to put the Expos.
They were trying to wait out the economy.
Time hasn't done much for the economy, but it did give baseball time to find a knight on a big white horse.
The Washington mayor, Anthony Williams, came riding in and pledged that the District of Columbia would build a new ballpark for the new team, whatever the cost, which some estimates say could exceed $600 million.
The new owner, whose team will play at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium for the first three seasons, will have what might be the best stadium deal ever.
The Nationals will pay nothing for the construction of the park, pay $3.5 million a year for rent and receive all stadium related revenue from tickets, concessions, parking, signs and naming rights fees.
The prospect of getting that combined revenue and money from a regional sports network to be shared with the Baltimore Orioles will drive up the sale price.
A financial investment adviser said Monday that he would never advise a client to pay $400 million for the Nats, although maybe $300 million, but he acknowledged the possibility that some bidder might make a $400 million bid if he really wanted the team and wanted to break away from the crowd.
Just like the old Nationals, who became the Senators in 1957, these Nationals will have the right to change their name.
"When they move into the new stadium, the owner will have the right to petition to change the name," DuPuy said.
Club owners are expected to approve the team's move within the next two weeks, whether or not baseball officials have concluded an agreement with Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner, on compensation for intruding on what he considers his turf.
The Washington city council will vote on stadium financing next month.
Meanwhile, even though no owner is in place to decide which players he might want or how much he would spend on them, Jim Bowden continues to do his job as interim general manager.
Bowden has already demonstrated his acumen in running a low budget operation, having served as general manager of the economically deprived Cincinnati Reds for 10 1/2 years.
And in the space of a few days last week, Bowden signed half an infield's worth of free agents third baseman Vinny Castilla and shortstop Cristian Guzman and traded for a productive, if volatile, outfielder in Jose Guillen.
Bowden hasn't been told if he can exceed the $41 million payroll with which the Expos opened last season, but baseball officials have estimated that the Nationals will take in at least $100 million more in revenue than the Expos did.
That should give Bowden a little more to play with.
Even if he doesn't know who the new owner will be.
Baseball fans in the nation's capital can start dreaming again about their first opening day in 33 years.
The District of Columbia Council voted 7 6 Tuesday to approve legislation clearing the way for the Montreal Expos to move here next season and be renamed the Nationals.
The measure allows the city to sell up to $584 million (euro436 million) in bonds for construction of a 41000 seat stadium about a 1.6 kilometers (one mile) south of the Capitol, and for renovations to RFK Stadium, where the team will play next year.
Ticket and team merchandise sales were to resume Wednesday.
They were suspended for a week because of uncertainty caused by changes the council had made in the city's agreement with the team.
"The Nationals are finally rounding third and heading for home," said Mayor Anthony A. Williams, who negotiated the move with major league baseball officials.
Williams said he will sign the bill as soon as it reaches his desk, leaving only baseball commissioner Bud Selig's approval of the RFK renovations for the move to become final.
The Nationals' home opener on April 14 would be the first regular season major league game in the city since the Senators left to become the Texas Rangers after the 1971 season.
The city almost struck out a week earlier when the council amended Williams' deal with baseball officials to require that half the construction costs be paid privately, or it would be voided.
Baseball officials balked at the provision and threatened to take the team elsewhere if the original deal wasn't approved by Dec 31.
But Williams won the necessary votes after he, Cropp and baseball officials compromised during a day of intense negotiations Monday.
The final bill calls for the city and baseball to split the cost of insurance that would limit the city's liability on cost overruns or construction delays.
That amendment, introduced by Cropp, also reduces compensatory damages for the first year if the stadium is finished late.
Instead, the Washington Nationals would not have to pay $5.3 million (euro3.96 million) in rent if the ballpark is not ready for the 2008 season and the team has to remain at RFK.
A second amendment, approved 10 3, deletes a sunset provision that would have canceled the deal if there was no private financing.
Baseball officials were pleased with the vote and the guarantees that the stadium would be built as planned, Selig said.
"We are also pleased that our discussions with Washington's elected leaders over the last several days have helped each side better understand the concerns of the other," Selig said.
"We are now more confident than ever of a long and productive relationship with the city of Washington as we move forward with this great project."
Williams sent Cropp a letter Tuesday, noting his commitment to include private financing in the stadium package.
If there is no better proposal, Williams wrote, he will use a proposal from the Cleveland based Gates Group that would provide $100 million (euro74.66 million) in return for parking revenues near the stadium.
Supporters of the measure also made some parliamentary maneuvers to ensure the bill could not be reconsidered next year, when three new members who oppose the stadium project begin their terms.
The Montreal Expos can move to Washington, change their name and never play the Canadian national anthem again, but they cannot seem to go anywhere without the New York Mets following along for a photo op.
Despite everything that has changed with this vagabond franchise, its trusty sidekick remains the same.
More than 35 years after the Mets welcomed the Expos to the major leagues and more than five months after they ushered them out, the Mets once again rode shotgun into history on Wednesday.
The spring training schedule makers have quite a sense of symmetry.
The Expos played their first regular season game against the Mets in 1969 and their last game against the Mets on Oct 3, so it was only fitting that the Washington Nationals would play their first game against the Mets on opening day in the Grapefruit League.
If anyone missed the nostalgic significance of the event, the Mets will travel to Washington for the Nationals' first game at RFK Stadium, an exhibition on April 3.
By the end of the regular season, these two National League East companions will have met 26 times.
"It's getting really weird," Washington outfielder Brad Wilkerson said.
"It's always us and them."
In the first regular season game between thesefranchises, Tom Seaver started for the Mets at Shea Stadium and Coco Laboy powered the Expos to an 11 10 victory.
In their last meeting, Tom Glavine started for the Mets at Shea and Todd Zeile homered to deal the Expos an 8 1 defeat.
On Wednesday at Space Coast Stadium, Glavine started again for the Mets and the Nationals came back for a 5 3 victory.
"To start the last game and start the first game," Glavine said, "that's pretty cool."
The Mets can take solace in lessons of the past.
When they dropped the opener to this franchise in 1969, they went on to win the World Series.
"Maybe that's an omen for our team," said Mets outfielder Ron Calloway, who came over from the Expos this winter.
"Or maybe it's just a reach."
To celebrate their first game, the Nationals wore their regular season home uniforms instead of their batting practice jerseys.
They got their first hit from shortstop Christian Guzman and their first home run from outfielder Jose Guillen, both off season acquisitions.
The Nationals have sold 20000 season ticket packages in Washington, but they drew a more modest sellout of 7558 in Viera on Wednesday.
After the third inning, there was still a traffic jam outside the stadium, with ticket holders trying to get into the grass parking lot.
"There is a lot of enthusiasm and anticipation," Washington manager Frank Robinson said.
"There is interest in this ball club that hasn't been there before."
The Nationals were not the only players on a new team.
Doug Mientkiewicz started his first game for the Mets at first base and made a nifty scoop on a double play.
Kazuo Matsui started his first spring training game at second base and successfully charged two grounders, bare handing one and short hopping the other.
Carlos Beltran was in the Mets' lineup for the first time and went 1 for 3 with a searing single.
"I was a little nervous," Beltran said.
"But that's just me."
With Mike Piazza and Cliff Floyd back in Port St. Lucie, and Mike Cameron rehabilitating from wrist surgery, Beltran was the second most popular reason to watch Wednesday's game.
"Whenever I throw my last warm up pitch, I always turn around to make sure everybody is ready," Glavine said after working two shutout innings.
"To see the new guys we had out there, and to see Carlos in center field, it was a good feeling."
Even the Mets' rookie manager, Willie Randolph, was bouncing out of the dugout to greet players coming off the field.
After the Mets hired Randolph in November, one of the first congratulatory calls he received was from Robinson.
And after Randolph put on a Mets' uniform for the first time last month, one of his first calls was to Robinson.
This game will undoubtedly be remembered as the Nationals' introduction to baseball, but it also included two African American managers who have relied on each other for support.
"I think Willie is going to do really well," Robinson said.
Randolph seemed much more comfortable than Omar Minaya, the Mets' general manager, who could be forgiven for forgetting for a day which organization signs his paycheck.
Minaya, the Expos' general manager the past three years, helped make the Nationals a competitor and the Mets a contender.
In the first of many reunions with his former team, Minaya wore a blue hat with a white M on the front.
The hat was not a new style released by the Mets.
It was worn by the Montreal Royals, Jackie Robinson's first professional baseball team.
"I'm happy today, and I'm also a little bit sad," Minaya said.
"I'm happy for Washington, but I'm sad for Montreal.
It can be sort of emotional.
There is a lot of newness here today."
As a sign that not everything had changed, the former first round draft choice Aaron Heilman allowed three runs in two innings for the Mets, wasting a pair of run scoring hits from Jason Phillips.
Felix Heredia, who frustrated Yankees' fans last season, gave up the winning run in the sixth.
Heredia did not get any help from his former Yankees' teammate, infielder Miguel Cairo, who booted a ground ball at third base to score the run.
The Mets and the Yankees have had many players go back and forth across town over the years, but the Mets and the Nationals share a more common history.
The two franchises always seem to be starting over at the same time, and often on the same field.
The city's top two political leaders cleared the way Monday night for Major League Baseball in the nation's capital, after daylong negotiations to guarantee the construction of a stadium that baseball officials demanded to relocate the former Montreal Expos here.
The city's mayor, Anthony A. Williams, and the City Council chairman, Linda W. Cropp, agreed, together with baseball officials, to alterations in the deal the mayor made with Major League Baseball in September that used mostly taxpayer dollars for stadium construction.
Cropp wanted to minimize the use of public money to build a stadium, which has been estimated to cost as much as $585 million.
The compromise will be voted on Tuesday by the full 13 member council at its last meeting of the year.
Cropp persuaded fellow council members last week to adopt an amendment requiring private financing for the new stadium, where the renamed Washington Nationals team would play.
The compromise reached late Monday assures that 50 percent of the stadium will be privately financed, said the mayor's spokesman Chris Bender.
Several private financing possibilities already have been investigated by city officials, Bender said, including a parking meter plan that is expected to generate $100 million in upfront revenue for the city.
If no other private deals are found, Bender said, the city expects to sign onto the parking arrangement offered by the Cleveland based Gates Group.
In return for assurances that private financing is viable, Cropp said she would drop her legislative language requiring a specific amount of private financing, a demand which had aroused the ire of baseball supporters since they feared that it would torpedo the team's chances of moving here.
Baseball officials also agreed to reduce the $19 million in damages the city would incur if the new stadium, to be built by the Anacostia River in Southeast Washington, did not open by March 2008.
Instead, the city would forfeit a $5 million yearly rental payment it would earn when the Nationals team plays at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, which it is set to do beginning in 2005.
Baseball officials also agreed to split the cost of construction insurance with the city to limit taxpayer liability, Bender said.
Williams said that having a team was not just about baseball, but also "about revitalizing the Anacostia River, creating new jobs, bringing in new tax revenues and creating a new source of civil pride."
The White House said Thursday it hoped that the city of Washington and Major League Baseball could still reach an agreement that would bring a professional team to the US capital city.
US President George W. Bush, an avid fan and former team owner, "thought it was great that baseball would be coming to Washington," spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters.
"Hopefully, they'll be able to work things out."
The District of Columbia Council has voted to require private financing for at least half the construction costs of a new ballpark for the Nationals the former Montreal Expos, who are due to kick off next season in their new city against Arizona on April 14.
"The legislation is inconsistent with our carefully negotiated agreement and is wholly unacceptable to Major League Baseball," MLB president and CEO Bob DuPuy said in a statement a day after Tuesday's vote.
In the initial agreement between the team and Washington Mayor Anthony A. Williams, the city was to be responsible for 531 million dollars in bonds to finance the stadium plan.
But under the legislation approved by the council, 50 percent of the costs must come from private financing, or the approval for the plan expires.
With the new provision in place, the Nationals may have to reopen bidding for a permanent home if private financial obligations are not met.
Asked whether Bush supported public financing for sports stadiums, McClellan replied: "Those are local decisions."
Iraqis nervously came out to vote Sunday in their first multi party elections in half a century, defying the threat of attacks by insurgents bent on sabotaging the vote.
Shortly after polls opened, a suicide bomber struck in Baghdad, killing one person and injuring another four, despite massive security precautions across the country.
A steady stream of people in Shiite Muslim and Kurdish areas took part in the first elections since the overthrow of former dictator Saddam Hussein almost two years ago.
But there were immediate signs of Sunni Muslim strongholds rejecting the vote.
Interim President Ghazi Al Yawar was among the first to vote, casting his ballot in Baghdad just a few hours after a rocket attack on the US embassy in the capital that killed two Americans.
"Thank God, Thank God.
Blessed are the Iraqi elections.
We greet all Iraqi people and urge them not to give up their rights, to vote for Iraq, elect Iraq and not to give up on Iraq," said Yawar.
Sunni Muslim insurgents have vowed to wreak havoc on the vote to choose a 275 member national assembly which will wire a new post Saddam constitution.
A suicide bomber blew himself up near a polling centre in the Mansur district of western Baghdad, killing one person was killed and four wounded.
Sporadic explosions and machine gun fire were heard across the centre of the capital in the early morning.
A mortar was also fired near the US military base in the northern city of Kirkuk just before polling stations opened.
In Shiite dominated southern Iraq voters appeared to be turning out enthusiastically Taha Lufta waited outside a station at the Al Amaali school in the southern city of Basra when it opened at 7:00 am (0400 GMT).
"I came here to be first and encourage the people to vote," he said.
"I'm an old man.
I want to be a model for others."
Lufta said he had voted for the Shiite list the United Iraqi Alliance "because it includes Islamists, and we want an Islamic constitution in Iraq."
The alliance has the key backing of Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani, the spiritual leader of Iraqi Shiites and is expected to be the biggest single bloc in the new assembly.
Long lines of people were also reported outside voting stations in Kurdish strongholds such as Arbil in the north of the country.
But the head of the local council in the Sunni Muslim stronghold of Samarra said nobody would vote there because of safety fears.
"Nobody will vote in Samarra because of the security situation," said Taha Hussein.
An AFP correspondent said there were no election staff at polling stations and police could not be seen on the streets of the city where US forces battled insurgents in October.
An American serviceman and civilian staff member were killed and five wounded in the embassy attack late Saturday thatst of the country and the authorities banned travel between provinces.
On Saturday, the authorities extended for one month the state of emergency under which it can order curfews and other special measures.
US President George W. Bush joined Iraqi leaders in appealing for the population to brave the insurgent threats to make the election a success.
US President George W. Bush and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan both appealed for Iraqis to brave the violence and vote.
Bush warned Saturday that "terrorists" were bent on wrecking the Iraqi election.
"The terrorists and those who benefitted from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein know that free elections will expose the emptiness of their vision for Iraq," Bush said.
Earlier Annan made a special plea to Iraqis saying: "Please exercise your democratic rights on Sunday.
Whatever your feelings about how the country reached this point, this election offers an opportunity to move away from violence and uncertainty toward peace and representative government."
But with world attention fixed on the turnout, the impact of the attacks added new uncertainty to the outcome.
US military leaders have warned that despite the huge security clampdown more attacks, particularly by suicide bombers.
Iraqi police guarded polling stations with the army forming a second ring and rapid reaction force units from the 150000 US troops in Iraq playing a support role.
The Iraqi election commission on Friday predicted a 57 percent national turnout.
A poll by the Washington based International Republican Institute said it would be 63.8 percent.
Sunday was also the final day for Iraqi exiles, many of whom fled Saddam's rule, to take part in voting in 14 countries across the world.
In a sharp contrast to the rest of Iraq, no citizens went to the only voting center in the battle ravaged city of Fallujah on Sunday, a Xinhua correspondent said.
"No one headed to the voting center till now, and most people here said they were afraid of US soldiers densely deployed in the city," he said.
With loud speakers, US marines kept on calling on local people to go to the polling station, but the much alienated Fallujans apparently declined to do so.
US and Iraqi forces stormed the city last November to clear it of insurgents, forcing some 200000 citizens to take refuge in makeshift tents in nearby villages.
On the eve of the election day, two more polling centers, in al Risala and al Shurta districts, were set up in an effort to leave an impression that no province will be marginalized in the elections.
The vast Anbar province, where Fallujah is situated, has not seen any electoral advertisement.
Insurgents have in the past days targeted polling centers instead.
People believed that the interim government could not even open a voting center as it would be an easy target for armed groups widespread in the territory.
Sunday's nationwide polls opened on Sunday morning, ushering in a new course of the oil rich but violence shattered country.
The 275 seat National Assembly will be formed by proportional representation of votes with a one year mandate.
It will choose a transitional government and draft a permanent constitution put for a national referendum by Oct 15.
A new government and parliament will then be elected through another ballot by the end of this year under the guidance of the constitution.
A female voter was killed and a second woman and her child were wounded in a mortar attack on a polling station in the northern Iraqi town of Balad, police said, raising the election day death toll to six.
"One woman was killed, another female was wounded along with her child in a mortar attack on a voting centre in Balad at 8:45 am (0545 GMT)," a police officer said.
A second mortar attack also struck near another polling station in Balad, predominently Shiite town in the middle of the Sunni Muslim heartland.
A suicide car bomber hit a polling station in western Baghdad Sunday morning shortly after the beginning of the landmark elections, killing a policeman.
Two Iraqi soldiers and two civilians were wounded in the attack outside Zahraa School, being used as a voting center, police said.
A mortar struck a voting centre in Baghdad's Shiite slum of Sadr City Sunday, killing four voters and wounding seven others on Iraq's election day, police said.
"A mortar struck a polling centre, killing four and wounding seven," said police lieutenant Mohamed Hamid.
The attack hit a voting centre in the Shiite slum of 2.5 million people, where the country's long oppressed religious majority were exercising their right to vote for the first time since the downfall of Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003.
A suicide bomber killed one person and wounded four others near a polling centre in Baghdad's upmarket Mansur district Sunday as Iraq's historic vote unfolded, the interior ministry said.
The blast happened outside a voting station near the near the popular al Saad restaurant in Mansur, in the western part of the capital, the ministry said.
US commanders have warned of suicide attacks, car bombs and mortar and rocket fire on Iraq's first free election in half a century as insurgents try to wreck the milestone event.
In the southern city of Basra, a mortar shell landed near a polling station but there were no reports of casualties.
A bomb exploded at a polling station in central Basra shortly after voting began on Sunday, said reports from the southern Iraqi city.
No reports on casualties were immediately available from the blast at a school which was turned into a polling station, a police spokesman was quoted as saying.
A suicide bomber struck in an upmarket neighbourhood of Baghdad on Sunday and mortar attacks and gunfire erupted around the country as Iraqis went to the polls for their first free election in 50 years.
One person was killed and four others wounded when a bomber blew himself up near a polling centre in Baghdad's upmarket Mansur district in the western part of the capital, the interior ministry said.
Police and soldiers had stopped the bomber as he tried to enter the sealed off cordon around the polling station when the attacker detonated his explosives belt, a US military officer said.
US commanders have warned of suicide attacks, car bombs and mortar and rocket fire on Iraq's first election since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein almost two years ago as insurgents try to wreck the milestone event.
Six explosions jolted the northern Iraqi city of Mosul although the general hospital had no immediate word on casualties.
Heavy security was in place around polling stations in the city, riven by insurgent violence since November.
Iraqi soldiers surrounded polling stations, and it was difficult for people to move around the city.
At one polling centre in northern Mosul visited by AFP the station was deserted except for the workers inside.
Arms fire also reverberated in the northern flashpoint city of Baquba, an AFP correspondent said, as the streets remained empty shortly after the opening of polls.
It was not clear what was the cause of shooting in the city that has been the site of fierce clashes in the past between US forces and insurgents.
One voting centre at the Al Hussan bin Ali school in central Baquba was empty as US armoured vehicles cruised the city.
In the southern city of Basra, a mortar shell landed near a polling station but there were no reports of casualties.
A suicide car bombing and a series of blasts rocked Iraq's capital Baghdad and other major cities Sunday as voters began to cast ballots in the elections for a transitional parliament amid heavy security.
A suicide car bomber hit a polling station in western Baghdad Sunday morning shortly after the voting began, killing a policeman and injuring four others, including two Iraqi soldiers and two civilians.
The attack occurred at a checkpoint outside Zahraa School, being used as a voting center, police said.
A string of explosions were heard in the center of the capital after the bombing.
The nature of the blasts and whether they caused casualties were unknown.
In Baghdad's Shiite slum of Sadr City, a mortar struck a voting center, killing four voters and wounding seven others, police said.
In the southern city of Basra, a mortar shell landed near a polling station but there were no reports of casualties.
A wave of blasts also jolted the religiously mixed city of Baqouba, about 50 km northeast of Baghdad, within the first two hours of the election.
The blasts were believed to be mortar fire in different parts of the city.
Baqouba has a mixed Sunni Arab, Shiite and Kurdish population and has been an insurgency hotspot.
In another previous insurgent stronghold, Fallujah, the streets were deserted except for US troops and Iraqi security forces.
Five polling centers were open in the town, but so far no voters have turned up.
The polls opened on a chilly, dark morning at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) and were due to stay open until 5 p.m. (1400 GMT).
An estimated 100000 policemen and soldiers were deployed across the country and traffic restrictions were imposed in many cities to ensure a smooth process.
Iraqis will elect a 275 seat National Assembly, which will in turn choose a transitional government and draft a permanent constitution to pave the way for a new government and a new parliament to be elected by the end of this year.
Iraqi officials hope for a turnout of at least 50 percent to lend legitimacy to the results.
But many Iraqis, intimidated by insurgent groups which vowed to turn the election into a bloodbath, may keep away from polling stations for fear of life.
A female voter was killed and a woman and her child were wounded in a mortar attack on a polling station in the northern Iraqi town of Balad, police said, raising the election day death toll to six.
Hours before Iraqis headed to the polls for a momentous vote, a rocket struck the U.S. Embassy compound Saturday inside the heavily fortified Green Zone, killing two people and shattering the relative calm of election eve in the capital.
The rocket attack marked a rare direct hit for insurgents, who frequently target the sprawling embassy complex but have never before killed anyone inside.
The stunning strike came despite a massive nationwide security clampdown, complete with Iraqi army tanks rumbling through the capital for the first time since the fall of Saddam Hussein.
Elsewhere in the country, several bombings and attacks on polling places marred the day before elections.
But the kind of large scale insurgent offensive that some had feared did not materialize.
Authorities expect the violence to worsen Sunday, when voters will be particularly vulnerable as they venture to some of the more than 5200 polling places.
"I think we'll see millions of people across Iraq vote tomorrow," said Lt. Gen. Thomas F. Metz, operational chief for the more than 150000 coalition troops here.
During his weekly radio address Saturday, President Bush hailed Iraqi voters, who he said were "standing firm" despite threats.
His remarks were aired shortly before the embassy was struck.
"Tomorrow's elections will happen because of their courage and determination," Bush said.
"In the face of assassination, brutal violence and calculated intimidation, Iraqis continue to prepare for the elections and to campaign for their candidates."
Iraqis are scheduled to choose a 275 member transitional national assembly, 18 provincial councils and, in three northern provinces, a Kurdish Parliament.
U.S. and Iraqi security forces spent Saturday setting up cordons around polling stations in an effort to protect voters.
"We are on the lookout," said Brig.
Gen. Adil Molan Ghaidan, police chief in Diyala province northeast of Baghdad.
More than 14 million Iraqis are eligible to vote, but turnout is unpredictable amid the violence that has swept across large swaths of Iraq and amid the deep fissures among the nation's three major groups Shiite Muslims, Sunni Muslims and ethnic Kurds.
This tense capital, its streets devoid of most civilian traffic but bristling with edgy U.S. soldiers and Iraqi forces wearing black ski masks, was oddly quiet through most of Saturday.
Anxious troops wary of suicide car bombers trained weapons on the few vehicles that were on Baghdad's usually gridlocked streets, ordering many drivers to halt and submit to searches.
At one major intersection, an Iraqi armed personnel carrier incongruously offered free rides to children.
Security measures included restrictions on driving, a shutdown of Baghdad's international airport and the closure of the country's borders.
Repeated reports circulated that insurgents had stolen police trucks or ambulances and were planning to launch suicide attacks from those vehicles.
A roadside bomb killed a U.S. soldier in western Baghdad, authorities reported.
After nightfall, military trucks rolled through Baghdad's streets shining high power spotlights and warning residents on loudspeakers to stay indoors during the new curfew hours and heed the government's ban on driving.
Sporadic bursts of gunfire resounded through the darkened streets.
The rocket attack that struck the embassy compound occurred shortly before 8 p.m., triggering a wail of sirens from the Green Zone, a sealed off swath of central Baghdad that is home to Western diplomats, contract workers, U.S. troops and others.
The Iraqi Independent Electoral Commission, which runs the elections, is also housed there.
According to a U.S. statement, the rocket struck a building connected to the embassy's annex in Saddam's former Republican Palace.
The huge palace houses much of the embassy's office space.
The Baghdad embassy, one of the largest U.S. missions in the world, is said to be home to some 3000 employees, including a huge security contingent along with diplomats, representatives of assorted U.S. agencies and Iraqi staff.
The facility sits behind two cordons of concrete blast walls and a series of security barriers, checkpoints and body searches all testament to its presence in one of the world's most hostile environments for U.S. personnel.
The embassy, which opened last June after sovereignty was returned to an Iraqi interim government, is the first U.S. mission here in more than a decade.
Many embassy workers are housed in nearby prefabricated trailers protected by blast walls and sandbags, the trailers remain vulnerable to mortar and rocket attacks.
It was not clear precisely where the rocket hit.
Outside the capital, a suicide attack earlier in the day in the small Kurdish town of Khanaqin, near the Iranian border, heightened fears that insurgents may try to infiltrate polling stations with bombs or suicide belts.
The bomber killed eight people near a police station after detonating an explosives laden vest.
Six others were injured, according to a source at the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, a leading Kurdish political party.
Despite the increased security presence, insurgents hit five polling centers around Baqubah, an ethnically divided regional capital northeast of Baghdad.
Mortars struck two schools in the city, homemade bombs damaged two others, and gunmen sprayed a fifth with bullets and rocket propelled grenades.
Scores of attacks have targeted polling places across Iraq in recent days, officials said, but mostly the buildings have been empty and casualties have been low.
In and around the city of Kirkuk in the north, seven election centers were attacked with small arms fire or mortars, according to Lt. Col Yadgar Mohammed, operations room director for the Iraqi national guard in Kirkuk.
In southern Basra, U.S. and Iraqi troops sealed off borders with neighboring countries, padlocking gates leading to Iran, blocking roads to Kuwait and closing the Um Qasir sea port leading to the Persian Gulf.
In Baghdad, hundreds of young men showed up near the Convention Center for $200 a day jobs guarding polling stations.
"I've been without a job ever since the war, so I signed up for this job because it seems to be honorable and I'd like to a part of it," said Abass Mihseen, 42, a former Iraqi Army officer.
"Maybe it's a new start for my career."
At a schoolhouse being used as a polling center in Baghdad's Sadr City neighborhood, election workers pushed aside metal desks and set up cardboard voting booths.
"Everything is ready for tomorrow," said Dhia Fakhir, 38, manager of the voting center.
"Nobody resigned."
By late afternoon, Carlos Valenzuela, the top U.N. adviser to the electoral commission, declared that matters were proceeding apace.
"So far, things are going ahead of schedule," said a cautious Valenzuela, flanked by bodyguards in Baghdad's cavernous convention center.
But election preparations were not as smooth in other parts of the country, particularly in Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland to the north and west of the capital.
Sunnis have dominated Iraq for decades but have lost power to rival Shiite and Kurdish groups in the new order following the U.S. led toppling of Saddam, himself a Sunni.
Many Sunni clerics and politicians are vowing to boycott the vote, viewing it as another step in their minority community's marginalization.
Insurgents, believed to be mostly Sunni Arabs, have vowed to kill anyone who votes.
Mohammad Jobouri, head of the electoral commission in largely Sunni Salahuddin province, predicted that only 10 percent of voters would turn out in Tikrit, Saddam's birthplace.
It is possible that no one will vote in the restive city of Samarra, he added.
(Optional add end) "It's all because of the bad security, violence and terrorist attacks recently," he said.
Some Shiite clerics have preached that anyone who does not vote today will face the wrath of God.
The Shiite religious and political leadership views the elections as a means of gaining their long denied place of power in Iraq, where they are in the majority.
Kurds are also encouraging people to vote despite the threats.
Throughout Iraq, people vowed not to be intimidated.
"This is going to be a free and honest experiment," said Amir Moosa, 42, of Basra.
"We do not fear threats.
Even bombs won't stop us.
It is our destiny."
Times staff writers Alissa J. Rubin in Baghdad and Tom Hamburger in Washington and special correspondents in Samarra, Basra, Kirkuk and Baghdad contributed to this report.
A suicide bomber wearing an explosives belt walked up to an Iraqi polling station on Saturday and set off a blast that killed a child and seven adults, including three soldiers, said police and the US military.
The attack was one of a series by insurgents in which at least 18 people were killed on the eve of Iraq's historic election despite massive security measures across the country.
The suicide bomber approached workers putting up protective barriers around the voting centre in Khanaqin, a town near the border with Iran.
The blast killed the child, the three soldiers and four of the workers and wounded seven more workers, the sources said.
The polling centre is close to the headquarters of a Turkmen political party.
In Sulimaniyah, an official with the Kurdistan Patriotic Union said the attacker had been identified as a Sudanese member of Iraq's most wanted man Abu Musab al Zarqawi's network.
"It was a Sudanese member of Al Qaeda," Molla Bakhtiar, a member of the party's political bureau, told reporters.
Neither US nor Iraqi authorities could confirm the statement.
Zarqawi, a Jordanian born fugitive with a 25 million dollar US price on his head, has taken a high profile role opposing the elections and threatening "all out war" against everyone involved.
In Samara, 120 kilometres (75 miles) north of Baghdad, a soldier and a policeman were killed in clashes with insurgents, police said.
Four soldiers and two civilians were also wounded.
Insurgents have stepped up attacks on political parties, security forces and civilians in the run up to Sunday's election, the first since the fall of former president Saddam Hussein almost two years ago.
As well as the suicide bomber, the US military said an insurgent was killed trying to attack a power station.
Four police were shot dead just before midnight Friday on the main road between the towns of Baiji and Shorgat, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of the capital, police said.
Four polling stations in Baiji faced bomb attacks on Saturday and two on Friday night in Shorgat.
US forces clashed with insurgents in the Sunni stronghold town of Ramadi, west of Baghdad, and one civilian was killed, a hospital doctor said.
American forces were deployed across the city.
Three voting stations were opened and almost immediately came under rebel attack.
One policeman was shot dead in an attack on a polling station Saturday in Moqdadiya, 105 kilometers (65 miles) north of Baghdad.
Insurgents attacked a police patrol at Salman Pak, just south of Baghdad, on Saturday killing two security forces, police said.
Gunmen opened fire on a polling station in the Jamia district of western Baghdad wounding one woman, police said.
US and Iraqi forces fought insurgents in Baghdad and a heavy bursts of gunfire erupted in the centre of the capital as a convoy of Iraqi soldiers moved from the Green Zone, the high security area that houses the Iraqi government and the US and British embassies.
The US military said Iraqi forces fought off an attack on a power station in the northern city of Mosul on Friday night, killing one insurgent.
The group of Al Qaeda's frontman in Iraq Abu Musab al Zarqawi claimed responsibility Saturday for a suicide attack at an Iraqi polling station and vowed to spill more blood on election day, according to a statement posted on an Islamist website.
"A lion from the martyrdom seeking brigade of the Al Qaeda Group of Jihad in the Land of Two Rivers carried out an attack against the Americans and their agents in the Khanaqin region," said the statement, whose authenticity could not be verified.
"This is only (a small) part of what our virtuous sheikh Abu Musab al Zarqawi promised," the statement said.
"We warn for the last time that tomorrow will be a bloody day for the Jews, the Christians, their agents, and anyone who agrees to play the American Allawi game," added the statement in a reference to Iraqi interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi.
Iraqi police and the US military said that a suicide bomber wearing an explosives belt walked up to an Iraqi polling station in Khanaqin, a town near the border with Iran, and set off a blast that killed eight people, including a child and three soldiers.
The attack was one of a series by insurgents in which at least 18 people were killed on the eve of Iraq's US backed election despite massive security measures across the country.
An official from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) in the Kurdish town of Suleimaniyah said the attacker had been identified as a Sudanese member of Zarqawi's network.
"It was a Sudanese member of Al Qaeda," Molla Bakhtiar, a member of the party's political bureau, told reporters.
Zarqawi, a Jordanian born fugitive with a 25 million dollar US price on his head, has threatened to attack anyone involved in Sunday's polls.
Insurgents killed at least 19 Iraqis and bombed polling stations on Thursday in a fierce campaign to wreck Sunday's general elections.
With the election only three days away, violence has been escalating.
The flurry of attacks, following a helicopter crash that killed 31 US troops on Wednesday, were concentrated on the heartland of Iraq' minority Sunnis.
In the deadliest attack on Thursday, a car bomb hit an Iraqi army patrol near a polling station in Samarra, a mainly Sunni Muslim city.
Seven Iraqis were killed and five others wounded, police said.
In Baquba, 60 km northeast of the capital Baghdad, a suicide car bomb hit the headquarters of a provincial government, killing five people.
South of Baghdad, in the so called triangle of death, a homemade bomb killed five Iraqis and injured 15 on the road between Mahmudiyah and Latifiyah.
Gunmen killed a policeman in an attack in Musayyib, south of Baghdad, and a roadside bomb killed a police officer in Baiji.
One US Marine was killed in action and four others wounded while conducting security and stability operations in Babil Province, according to the US military.
Three small bomb blasts occurred at polling stations in Iraq's southern city of Basra on Thursday, but no one was hurt, according to a British army spokesman.
With about 40 polling stations destroyed by insurgents, even the distribution of ballot boxes for Iraq's 13 million eligible voters, about half of the country's population, underscored the grim security situation.
In the Shiite holy city of Najaf, Iraqi police, US troops and Iraqi security forces sealed off an area within a one kilometer perimeter around a school to be used as a polling station when ballot papers were brought in.
Several guerrilla groups, including a faction led by Abu Musab al Zarqawi, have declared war on the poll, vowing to kill anyone who votes.
The militant group Army of Ansar al Sunna issued a "final warning," saying anyone who votes would be marked for death, either during or after the election.
"Those who don't pay heed will have only themselves to blame," the group said in a statement on the Internet.
The faction led by al Qaida ally Abu Musab al Zarqawi said Thursday on a website that it had executed a candidate of interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi's party and a video would be released later.
In the past two months, 22 members of Allawi's party were killed, according to party official Imad Shbib.
In the countdown to the election, the Iraqi security forces bore the brunt of the attacks.
While US forces worked to quell the insurgency, the US State Department has asserted that Iraqis will take "paramount" responsibility in providing security for the election.
"I think you will see on Election Day that most of the security is being provided by the Iraqis and the Iraqi forces," said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.
Boucher said US President George W. Bush was confident that the world would recognize the legitimacy of the election despite worries that it would be marred by a boycott by Sunni Muslims and violence.
US military commanders and Iraqi officials predict that violence will flare up as insurgents attempt spectacular new attacks.
Meanwhile, US President Bush and interim Iraqi President Ghazi al Yawar on Thursday discussed efforts to get Iraqis to vote despite growing violence.
This was the seventh conversation that Bush has had with Iraqi leaders since the beginning of 2003.
Despite Bush's confidence in the election, Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday that the election would not be fully democratic since one major ethnic group is to be absent.
Russia, a major player in the arena of world politics, said on Thursday that it would not send observers to monitor the election due to the security situation there.
Four hundred Iraqis have been killed so far this month and dozens of voting stations attacked across Iraq on Friday, a senior US military officer said Saturday.
The commander, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 400 Iraqi civilians, officials and security officers had been killed as part of a campaign of intimidation ahead of Sunday's election, the officer said.
As part of that campaign, insurgents have escalated their attacks on polling stations.
"It was,45 attacks on polling stations around the country yesterday," the officer said.
Iraq is on high alert for violence on the day of the election, the first free vote in decades.
A suicide car bomber killed five people Saturday in an attack on a political party's offices in the Iraqi town of Khanaqin near the border with Iran, police said.
Six police were killed in other attacks around Baghdad and strikes against poll stations were reported across Iraq on the eve of the country's historic election.
The US military said at least one insurgent was also killed.
A major gunbattle also erupted in central Baghdad as a convoy of Iraqi soldiers moved from the Green Zone, a high security area that houses the Iraqi government and the US embassy, towards one of the main bridges crossing the Tigris river.
A child and four adults were killed in the early morning attack in Khanaqin, which lies about 120 kilometers (100 miles) northeast of Baghdad, close to the frontier with Iran.
"The suicide bomber's car was packed with explosives when he drove into the headquarters of the Turkmen of Iraq Front," said Colonel Mahmoud Abdallah of the town's police.
Insurgents have stepped up attacks on political parties, security forces and civilians in the run up to Sunday's election, the first since the fall of former president Saddam Hussein almost two years ago.
Four police were shot dead just before midnight Friday as they drove on the main road between the towns of Baiji and Shorgat, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of the capital, police said.
Four other polling stations in Baiji faced bomb attacks on Saturday and two on Friday night in Shorgat.
Insurgents attacked a police patrol at Salman Pak, just south of Baghdad, on Saturday killing two security forces, police said.
Gunmen opened fire on a polling station in the Jamia district of western Baghdad wounding one woman, police said.
The US military said Iraqi forces fought off an attack on a power station in southwestern Mosul on Friday night, killing one insurgent.
Insurgents set off a car bomb and attacked polling stations and security forces in several Iraqi cities Friday, killing at least six people as Iraqi exiles across the globe began voting in their country's landmark election.
Four people were killed in a suicide car bomb attack at a power station in the southern Baghdad neighbourhood of Dura, while an Iraqi soldier and a policeman were killed in separate attacks in Samarra and Kirkuk Campaigning by candidates for Sunday's election officially ended on Friday, as Iraqi expatraites in 14 countries from the Middle East to Australia to the United States began voting in a three day process.
"Yes, we did it!" shouted Ali al Kabeer, clapping his hands after casting his ballot in Dubai and breaking into tears as he hugged his wife who also voted.
Kabeer, a commercial director, said he had "been waiting for this moment for 54 years," 24 of which he has spent in England and the UAE.
"I'm doing this for my children ,it's the first step in a thousand mile journey."
However, insurgents, including Al Qaeda frontman Abu Musab al Zarqawi, have vowed to wreck the country's first democratic vote in decades and there are fears the violence will pursue right through the election weekend and beyond.
At least 60 people have been killed in a spate of attacks across the country over the past two days alone, in additon to the killing of 31 US military personnel in a helicopter crash in western Iraq on Wednesday.
The Iraqi authorities have ordered tough security measures, including a curfew, sealing off the borders and the closure of Baghdad international airport from Saturday.
US President George W. Bush has urged Iraqis to brave death threats and seize what he termed an "historic opportunity" to vote, while a British newspaper reported the United States and Britain have privately agreed on a way of withdrawing their troops from Iraq.
Supporters of Zarqawi, Iraq's most wanted man, on Thursday posted a video on the Internet of their murder of a candidate in Iraq's elections from the party of US backed interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi.
The Al Qaeda Group in the Land of Two Rivers announced Sunday on a website that it had executed Salem Jaafar al Kanani, "secretary of the traitor Iyad Allawi", and a video would be released at a later time.
Allawi's party has had at least 22 of its members killed in the space of two months, party official Imad Shbib said earlier this month, adding that as many as 44 had been murdered since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in April 2003.
An Islamist group linked to Al Qaeda warned it would attack Iraqis involved in the general election even after voting was over.
"We have warned you not to go to the centres of this sordid comedy, called voting bureaus ,we renew our warning.
They will be the targets of the mujahedeen (Islamist fighters)," Ansar al Sunna said in a website statement.
In London, The Guardian newspaper reported US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his British counterpart Geoff Hoon have agreed on a so called exit strategy based on doubling the number of Iraqi police trainees and setting up Iraqi paramilitary units.
The pair were acting on recommendations from retired US General Gary Luck, who was sent to Iraq by the Pentagon last month to look at the failings of Iraq's security force.
On Thursday, with some 40 polling stations already destroyed by insurgent attack, even the distribution of ballot boxes for Iraq's estimated 14.1 million eligible voters underscored the tension hanging over the poll.
Ballot boxes were distributed to 5300 odd polling centres across the country, along with millions of ballot papers and tens of thousands of bottles of indelible ink which voters will be tagged with to avoid fraud.
The total number of electoral staff is expected to swell to 200000 on polling day.
Bush said the vote offered an "historic opportunity" for Iraqis to start building a truly democratic society after decades of brutal dictatorship.
"This is a historic opportunity for the people of Iraq to vote for a government," Bush said in an interview with Arabic televison station Al Arabiya.
The US military's top commander in Iraq, General George Casey, told AFP that the more Iraqi security forces come on line, the less visible America's 150000 troops will be.
Sunday's election has been marred not only by growing violence but also by a boycott by many Sunni politicians concerned that the election will cede power to the long oppressed Shiite majority.
However, a high turnout is expected among Shiites and Kurds ready to exercise their right to vote.
At least 30 people were killed in Iraq as insurgents intensified attacks on Iraqi and US targets, and election workers backed by troops started distributing ballot boxes for the vote in just two days' time.
The latest attacks Thursday came as Iraqi exiles voting in Australia and New Zealand became the first to vote in their country's historic national elections early Friday.
The exiles began casting votes as a British newspaper reported the United States and Britain have privately agreed on a way of withdrawing their troops from Iraq.
Militants have promised an all out onslaught against the election, but US President George W. Bush has urged Iraqis to brave death threats and seize what he termed an "historic opportunity" to vote in Iraq on Sunday.

Meanwhile, Iraqi exiles registered at three centres, in Sydney, Melbourne and the remote community of Shepparton in Victoria state on Friday and started casting their ballots.
In London, The Guardian newspaper reported US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his British counterpart Geoff Hoon have agreed on a so called exit strategy based on doubling the number of Iraqi police trainees and setting up Iraqi paramilitary units.
The pair were acting on recommendations from retired US General Gary Luck, who was sent to Iraq by the Pentagon last month to look at the failings of Iraq's security force.
New attacks across Iraq followed the deaths of 31 US military personnel in a helicopter crash in western Iraq on Wednesday.
In one deadly attack Thursday, a car driven by a suicide bomber rammed an Iraqi army patrol in Samarra, a mainly Sunni Arab city north of Baghdad where US and Iraqi forces launched a massive operation last October to wrest control from insurgents before the vote.
As security forces sealed off the sector to evacuate victims, a second car burst onto the scene from the direction of a nearby hospital.
Eight soldiers and three civilians were killed, police said.
In Baquba, north of the capital, a car bomb attack on a provincial government headquarters killed five people while the bodies of four executed Iraqi soldiers were found in the city of Ramadi.
South of Baghdad, in the so called triangle of death, a homemade bomb killed five Iraqis and wounded 15 on the road between Mahmudiyah and Latifiyah.
A US marine was killed in the same area.
With some 40 polling stations already destroyed by insurgent attack, even the distribution of ballot boxes for Iraq's estimated 14.1 million eligible voters underscored the tension hanging over the poll.
In the Shiite holy city of Najaf south of the capital, police, US and Iraqi forces sealed off a one kilometre (0.6 mile) perimeter around a school being used as a polling station as ballot papers were taken in.
Amid the relentless violence, the electoral commission pressed on with its mission in the closing hours of the campaign.
Ballot boxes were distributed to 5300 odd polling centres across the country, along with millions of ballot papers and tens of thousands of bottles of indelible ink which voters will be tagged with to avoid fraud.
The total number of electoral staff is expected to swell to 200000 on polling day.

In Washington, top Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy called for a withdrawl of at least 12000 US troops after Sunday's poll with a goal of a complete pull out next year.
Sunday's election has been marred not only by growing violence but also by a boycott by many Sunni politicians concerned that the election will cede power to the long oppressed Shiite majority.
However, a high turnout is expected among Shiites and Kurds ready to exercise their right to vote.
Former US president Bill Clinton called Thursday on Iraq's Shiite majority to reach out to the nation's Sunni minority if they win this weekend's election.
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he also said he was "totally against" the notion of setting a timetable for the withdrawal of US troops.
Insurgents set off a car bomb and attacked voting stations and security forces in several Iraqi cities Friday, killing at least six people as campaigning for the election wrapped up and voters began casting their ballots abroad.
Four people were killed in a suicide car bomb attack at a power station in the southern Baghdad neighbourhood of Dura, police and medical sources said.
"At around 9:00 am (0600 GMT), a black GMC approached the checkpoint at the entrance of the power plant.
There was only a driver inside the car, his face was masked," a policeman who witnessed the attack told AFP.
"He was stopped at the checkpoint and a few seconds later, the explosion went off.
We lost three comrades and one civilian was also killed in the blast," said the policeman.
He was speaking from Baghdad's Yarmuk hospital, where medical sources at the emergency department confirmed the death toll and added that three others policemen and a civilian were also wounded in the attack.
Campaigning by candidates for Sunday's election officially ended on Friday morning, as Iraqi exiles in 14 countries across the globe began voting.
Insurgents, including Al Qaeda frontman Abu Musab al Zarqawi, have vowed to wreck the country's first democratic vote in decades.
The Iraqi authorities have ordered tough security measures, including a curfew, sealing off the borders and the closure of Baghdad international airport from Saturday.
But they have also warned that the insurgent violence will pursue right through the election weekend and beyond.
An Iraqi policeman was killed and two civilians wounded in a host of attacks on buildings to be used as voting stations around Kirkuk, 250 kilometers (150 miles) north of the capital.
The policeman was shot dead by attackers as he stood guard at one voting station in the east of the city, police told AFP.
Kirkuk has a divided population of Kurds, Arabs, Turkmans and other smaller minorities and has seen mounting violence this week.
A car bomb attack went off near a school to be used as a polling station in the same Baghad neighbourhood where the power station was targeted.
A police officer said the blast had caused material damage but no casualties.
An Iraqi soldier was killed and another wounded when their patrol vehicle went over a mine near Samarra, in the Sunni Triangle north of Baghdad, police said.
Other attacks were reported in the triangle.
One man was wounded in an attack on another polling station at Al Dur and another civilian was injured in a mortar attack on a voting centre in Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown.
Dozens of voting stations have been attacked by insurgents who have put up posters and handed out leaflets warning Iraqis not to vote.
US soldiers also discovered three makeshift bombs in Baghdad Friday.
Five US soldiers and at least eight Iraqis were killed Friday in a string of attacks, two days before Iraq's landmark elections which insurgents have vowed to drench in blood.
A US helicopter also crashed in the Baghdad area, two days after the crash of a transport helicopter left 31 US troops dead, inflicting on the US military its heaviest loss in a single incident since the March 2003 invasion.
Lieutenant Colonel James Hutton said that three soldiers were killed and another wounded in the explosion of a makeshift bomb in a western district of Baghdad.
Another two soldiers were killed and three wounded Friday in two separate incidents in the capital, bringing to 1412 the total number of US servicemen who died in Iraqi since the invasion almost two years ago.
An OH 58 Kiowa Warrior, a reconaissance chopper from the same Baghdad based division, crashed in a southwestern district of the capital, but there was no word on the fate of the two man crew.
"At this time, we have no evidence of hostile fire playing a role in the helicopter going down," Colonel Keith Walker said in a statement.
Earlier Friday, four people were killed in a suicide car bomb attack at a power station in the southern Baghdad neighbourhood of Dura, police and medical sources said.
"At around 9:00 am (0600 GMT), a black GMC approached the checkpoint at the entrance of the power plant.
There was only a driver inside the car, his face was masked," a policeman who witnessed the attack told AFP.
"He was stopped at the checkpoint and a few seconds later, the explosion went off.
We lost three comrades and one civilian was also killed in the blast," said the policeman.
He was speaking from Baghdad's Yarmuk hospital, where medical sources at the emergency department confirmed the death toll and added that three other policemen and a civilian were also wounded in the attack.
The bullet riddled bodies of six Iraqi soldiers were found Friday in the western city of Ramadi, where two more people were killed and eight wounded in fighting between Iraqi forces and insurgents.
"The bodies of six soldiers, with their dog tags, were found in central Ramadi," a police officer told AFP on condition of anonymity.
It was the latest in a series of finds of bodies of apparently executed security personnel in the city.
Iraqi troops traded fire with the Sunni Muslim insurgents Friday, in a gunfight in which a soldier and a civilian were killed, Lieutenant Colonel Mahmud Mohammed said.
Four women and four children were also wounded by mortar fire Thursday night, said Doctor Alaa al Rawi of the city's hospital.
An Iraqi policeman was killed and two civilians wounded in a host of attacks on buildings to be used as voting stations around Kirkuk, 250 kilometers (150 miles) north of the capital.
The policeman was shot dead by attackers as he stood guard at a voting station in the east of Kirkuk, which has a divided population of Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen, police told AFP.

A police officer said the blast caused material damage but no casualties.
But an Iraqi soldier was killed and another wounded when their patrol vehicle ran over a mine near Samarra, in the "Sunni Triangle" north of Baghdad, police said.
Other attacks were reported in the triangle.
One man was wounded in an attack on another polling station at Al Dur and another civilian was injured in a mortar attack on a voting centre in Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown.
Dozens of voting stations have been attacked by insurgents who have put up posters and handed out leaflets warning Iraqis not to vote.
Chess legend Bobby Fischer could leave his Japanese detention cell by the weekend, his supporters said Tuesday, a day after Iceland's parliament voted to grant him citizenship.
Backers in Iceland, where Fischer played a historic series of matches against Boris Spassky of the former Soviet Union in 1972, rallied to Fischer's aid after Japanese immigration authorities detained him last July and ordered him deported to the United States.
Tokyo alleges he was attempting to board a plane for the Philippines with an invalid U.S. passport.
On Monday, Iceland's parliament awarded the erratic former chess champion citizenship with a vote of 40 in favor and two abstaining.
Masako Suzuki, one of Fischer's lawyers, said she expected Fischer would be released within the week.
"Unless something very unexpected happens, that would be the natural course of events," she said.
Fischer's Icelandic citizenship still needs a presidential signature for it to become final, but that was expected Tuesday, Suzuki said.
"It is clear that there is no need to detain him anymore," she said.
"He wants to leave Japan immediately."
Fischer, 62, is fighting a deportation order to the United States, where he is wanted for violating sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia by playing an exhibition match against Spassky there in 1992.
He has instead asked to be sent to Iceland.
Tokyo has so far refused, saying Japanese law only allows for Fischer's deportation to a country where he is a citizen.
Miyoko Watai, his longtime companion and the head of the Japan Chess Association, said Fischer was "very happy" to hear the news of the Icelandic parliament vote.
Japanese Justice Minister Chieko Nono told reporters that if Fischer has been granted Icelandic citizenship, it would be "legally possible to deport him to that country."
"We will consider (the possibility) and make an appropriate decision," she said on TV Tokyo.
Though a recluse over the past decade, Fischer has emerged from silence in radio broadcasts and on his Web page to express anti Semitic views and rail against the United States.
Since being taken into custody, Fischer has said he wants to unilaterally renounce his U.S. citizenship, demanded political refugee status and announced that he intends to marry Watai.
It wasn't immediately clear if going to Iceland would help Fischer avoid extradition to the United States if he is charged.
The two countries have an extradition treaty.
A federal grand jury in Washington is also investigating possible money laundering charges involving Fischer, Richard J. Vattuone, one of his lawyers, said this month.
Fischer was reported to have received US$3.5 million from the Spassky rematch.
He boasted at the time that he didn't intend to pay any income tax on the winnings.
In Washington, the State Department declined comment, citing laws governing rights to privacy in such situations.
Fischer has the authority to waive his privacy rights but has not done do.
Iceland's Parliament voted Monday to grant Icelandic citizenship to the American chess star Bobby Fischer, laying the groundwork, his supporters said, for his release from the Japanese prison where he has been held since last summer.
"We are most happy," said Einar Einarsson, a spokesman for a committee that has been trying to free Fischer from Japan, where he is being detained while he fights deportation to the United States.
Einarsson, who called Fischer "part of our modern saga and part of our recent history," said Fischer, the 62 year old chess champion, might be released "in only a few days" and that an Icelandic delegation planned to travel to Tokyo to escort him back to Reykjavik.
In Washington, the State Department had no comment on the case, although a spokesman noted that renunciation of American citizenship did not allow citizens to escape prosecution of crimes in the United States.
Monday's vote appears to be a resolution of sorts to the curious legal limbo that Fischer fell into in 1992 when, the United States says, he violated economic sanctions against Yugoslavia by accepting a $3.3 million fee to play an exhibition match there.
After that, the always reclusive, progressively more difficult Fischer dropped out of sight, living in Budapest and possibly the Philippines and Switzerland and emerging now and then on radio stations in Iceland, Hungary and the Philippines to rant in increasingly belligerent terms against the United States and against Jews.
This latest episode began in July 2004, when he tried to board a plane from Japan to Manila and was seized by the Japanese authorities and accused of trying to leave the country on an invalid passport.
He has been held in prison since then while the various governments, as well as a staunch group of supporters in the chess world, have tried to find some resolution to what has been a vexing and delicate jurisdictional issue.
But while the United States which is also investigating the possibility of charging him with tax evasion regards Fischer as a fugitive from justice, in Iceland he is seen as a national hero.
It was in Reykjavik in 1972 that he defeated the Russian world champion, Boris Spassky, in an electrifying Cold War chess contest that pitted East against West.
As much as the African American track star Jesse Owens' defeat of Hitler's Aryan athletes did at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Fischer's victory in Iceland seemed to symbolize nothing less than the triumph of one way of life over another in this case, democracy over communism.
It is partly for that reason, said Bjarni Benediktsson, chairman of the parliamentary committee that recommended last week that Fischer be granted Icelandic citizenship, that Parliament voted in favor of his request on Monday.
Iceland had already agreed to issue a resident's permit and special passport to Fischer, but that had not proved enough for the Japanese authorities.
His supporters said they had received assurances from Japan that with full Icelandic citizenship and passport, Fischer would be free to leave the country.
"It was very clear from the outset that he had a great influence here," Benediktsson said of Fischer, speaking by telephone from Reykjavik.
"A new generation of international chess players was born here in Iceland after the world championship match in Reykjavik, and it was very clear from the outset of this matter that the authorities in Iceland have very warm feelings toward this memory."
He emphasized that the granting of citizenship was considered only as a last resort, "after the applicant had exhausted all other possibilities" of gaining freedom.
He also said Fischer's "personal opinions on social issues" had not been a factor.
An official at the Immigration Bureau of the Justice Ministry said nothing had been decided yet about whether or how Fischer might be released.
But the official said it is legally possible that he could be sent to Iceland as a destination of repatriation under the deportation order, if he is granted citizenship there.
"This is a historic battle pitting the world's sole superpower bully against one lone man who had the courage to fight for his own freedom to think and speak as he chooses," John Bosnitch, chairman of the group, said in a statement.
In a telephone interview, Einarsson played down the significance of Fischer's reputation for misanthropy and his habit of making incendiary public remarks.
"Everyone knows his views, and he doesn't need to repeat them again," he said.
"He's like Rembrandt or Mozart one of these very big people so his personality is beside the point."
He said Fischer was likely to make Iceland his home, at least for the time being.
"I think he will stay in Iceland a lot, at least for the coming months, and then he will travel feely around the world although I don't expect he will be going to America."
The State Department expressed disappointment Tuesday over Iceland's move to grant citizenship to chess legend Bobby Fischer that could allow him to avoid a US prison sentence.
Fischer, currently detained in Japan, faces 10 years in prison in the United States for playing a 1992 chess match in Yugoslavia in defiance of US sanctions imposed over the Balkan wars.
But plans to ship him back to his native country became clouded after the parliament in Iceland, where he played an epic match in 1972, voted Monday to grant him citizenship.
"It's an arrangement that we're disappointed by," deputy State Department spokesman Adam Ereli told reporters.
"Mr Fischer is a fugitive from justice.
There's a federal warrant for his arrest.
"He's being detained in Japan, awaiting deportation.
And that's the step that we're looking forward to," Ereli said.
Japan said Tuesday it may let the 62 year old Fischer leave for Iceland.
An Icelandic supporter of Bobby Fischer said Tuesday he had paid a registration fee that would allow the American chess legend to settle in Iceland.
"It costs 20 dollars to register a new Icelandic citizen, and I've happily paid this for him," Fischer supporter Einar S. Einarsson said.
Iceland's parliament voted Monday to give Fischer citizenship as he fights an order to deport him from Japan to the United States.
Einarsson said Fischer's Icelandic passport was expected to be ready Wednesday.
It was not clear whether the passport would be issued in Iceland or through the country's embassy in Japan.
Einarsson said another Icelandic Fischer supporter, Saemundur Palsson, would arrive in Tokyo on Friday to accompany Fischer to Iceland.
Fischer's Japanese lawyer, Masako Suzuki, said she expected him to be released within the week.
"Unless something very unexpected happens, that would be the natural course of events," she said.
The 62 year old mercurial chess genius has been in Japanese custody since his arrest at in July.
He is wanted in the United States for violating sanctions against the former Yugoslavia by playing a chess match there.
The legislation to grant Fischer Icelandic citizenship was passed on Monday, and officially became law with the approval of Iceland's Presidential Authority and was confirmed in the Parliament Newsletter.
Linda Hartley, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Iceland, said the United States was disappointed Iceland had granted Fischer citizenship.
"There has been no official contact between the State Department and the Icelandic government since Friday, when the State Department sent a message saying it was disappointed with the foreigner's passport issued to Fischer," Hartley said.
"Bobby Fischer still remains an American citizen.
There is a process that people can go through to renounce citizenship, but as of today he has not done this," Hartley said.
Since being taken into custody in Tokyo, Fischer has repeatedly denounced the U.S. deportation order as politically motivated, demanded refugee status and renounced his U.S. citizenship.
There is widespread support for Fischer in Iceland, where he played the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky in a world championship match in 1972.
AP writer Eric Talmadge in Tokyo contributed to this report.
After a series of strategic moves worthy of one of his greatest matches, fugitive chess legend Bobby Fischer reached an agreement with Japanese authorities to avoid deportation to the United States on Wednesday.
He will instead be released after nine months in prison here and flown to freedom in Iceland as early as Thursday morning, according to sources familiar with the case.
The deal to free Fischer came after Iceland a chess loving nation that hosted his historic Cold War era victory over Soviet chess king Boris Spassky in 1972 granted Fischer citizenship this week in a move helping him evade trial in the United States.
Fischer, 62, a New York native, has dodged a U.S. arrest warrant since making an anti American "political statement" by playing a 1992 chess match in Yugoslavia in alleged violation of then standing U.S. sanctions.
Fischer evaded U.S. authorities for more than a decade with the help of global chess fans from Argentina to the Philippines, who offered him shelter even as Fischer ventured out every now and then into the public eye to offer scathing anti American and anti Jewish rants.
He was finally nabbed at Narita International Airport outside Tokyo last July for traveling on a voided U.S. passport.
But Fischer's alleged 1992 crime is not considered an extraditable offense in Japan, and U.S. authorities were instead counting on Japanese laws mandating deportation of persons detained for traveling on false documents to their countries of citizenship.
Fischer tried a number of failed countermoves to block an unwelcome homecoming to the United States including seeking refugee status, renouncing his U.S. citizenship and unveiling plans to marry his avowed companion Miyoko Watai, a four time Japan women's chess champion.
But he found his checkmate in Iceland, where, at Fischer's request, the parliament honored his intellect and "historic connection" with the tiny island nation stemming from his 1972 match there by awarding him Icelandic citizenship with a 40 0 vote on Monday.
It came despite U.S. protests.
"Mr Fischer is a true Icelander now," Iceland's ambassador to Japan, Thordur Oskarsson, told reporters in Tokyo.
For the wily Fischer, who long ago brought an unlikely pizzazz to the bookish game of chess, his narrow escape marks yet another stroke of strategic genius.
An eccentric personality known for his bizarre behavior at matches and brief adherence to a religious cult, he became a celebrated American hero after besting Spassky at the 1972 championship in Reykjavik.
But in the years following his early retirement from the game, Fischer grew to resent the United States, regaling it as part the "global Jewish conspiracy" despite the fact that his mother was Jewish.
Fischer has insisted from his Japanese jail cell that U.S. officials are persecuting him for his political beliefs.
His supporters here have noted that U.S. authorities only revoked his passport after he took to the airwaves in Manila on Sept 11, 2001, hailing the terrorist attacks on the United States as "wonderful news" and adding that "I want to see the U.S. wiped out."
Bobby Fischer, the fugitive chess legend, reached an agreement Wednesday with Japanese authorities to avoid deportation to the United States, his supporters said.
Sources familiar with the case said he will instead be released after eight months in prison here and flown to freedom in Iceland as early as Thursday morning.
The deal to free Fischer came after Iceland a chess loving nation that hosted his historic Cold War era victory over Soviet Boris Spassky in 1972 granted Fischer citizenship this week in a move to help him evade trial in the United States.
Fischer, 62, who grew up in New York, has dodged a U.S. arrest warrant since playing a chess match in Yugoslavia in 1992 in violation of U.S. sanctions at the time.
Fischer evaded U.S. authorities for more than a decade with the help of global chess fans from Argentina to the Philippines, who offered him shelter even as he ventured out every now and then into the public eye to offer scathing anti American and anti Jewish rants.
He was finally nabbed in July at an airport outside Tokyo for traveling on a voided U.S. passport.
Fischer's alleged violation of U.S. sanctions is not considered an extraditable offense in Japan.
American authorities were instead counting on Japanese laws mandating deportation of persons detained for traveling on false documents to their countries of citizenship.
Fischer made a number of failed attempts to block an unwelcome homecoming to the United States including seeking refugee status, renouncing his U.S. citizenship and unveiling plans to marry his avowed companion Miyoko Watai, a four time women's chess champion in Japan.
But Fischer found success in Iceland, where, at his request, the parliament honored his "historic connection" with the tiny island nation, voting 40 to 0 Monday to grant him citizenship.
The move came despite U.S. protests.
"Mr Fischer is a true Icelander now," Iceland's ambassador to Japan, Thordur Oskarsson, told reporters in Tokyo.
Japanese officials agreed to allow Fischer to travel to his adopted homeland as long as he withdraws a still pending lawsuit he filed against the Japanese government to block his deportation.
John Bosnitch, chairman of the Tokyo based Committee to Free Bobby Fischer, said Fischer would do so Thursday morning before heading directly to the airport to board a flight to Iceland via Copenhagen.
"The people of Iceland have rescued Bobby Fischer from injustice," Bosnitch said.
The case had become an irritation for Japan, with Fischer alleging falsely, according to the Japanese that he had been physically abused by his captors.
A Japanese official familiar with the case said the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo had been informed of the decision to allow Fischer's release.
Fischer's resentment of the United States is well known.
He has said he regards it as part of the "global Jewish conspiracy," despite the fact that his mother was Jewish.
He has insisted from his Japanese jail cell that U.S. officials are persecuting him for his political beliefs.
Fischer entered Japan on a valid 90 day visa in April 2004, according to a copy of his passport on his Web site.
On Nov 6, 2003, he had gone went to the U.S. Embassy in Bern, Switzerland, and was given additional pages to his passport.
But a letter dated December 2003 from the U.S. Embassy in the Philippines, where Fischer has a daughter, advised him that his passport was being revoked.
Fischer, according to Bosnitch, never received the letter.
Now U.S. officials are preparing for a legal rematch.
They have suggested that they may file new tax evasion charges against Fischer who has publicly stated that he has not paid U.S. taxes since going into self imposed exile 12 years ago, including taxes on the $3 million he won during his rematch against Spassky in Yugoslavia.
Such charges, U.S. officials say, may fall under extraditable crimes in Iceland.
Iceland said Wednesday it hoped to give detained chess legend Bobby Fischer a passport before the weekend after granting him citizenship in a move that could allow him to avoid a US prison term.
Icelandic Ambassador to Japan Thordur Oskarsson told AFP that Iceland formally presented documents Wednesday to Japan's foreign and justice ministries confirming the US born genius's Icelandic citizenship.
On issuing him an Icelandic passport, the ambassador said: "I would say we want to deliver to him before the weekend."
"The passport is almost ready, but no exact time has been fixed," Oskarsson said, adding it would be issued at the Icelandic embassy in Tokyo.
Fischer, 62, known for his eccentric behavior and outspoken criticism of the United States, has been detained in Japan since July when he tried to fly out of Tokyo to the Philippines on his revoked US passport.
If he returns to the United States, he will face 10 years in prison over a chess game in 1992 in Yugoslavia in defiance of US sanctions imposed over the Balkan wars.
Iceland had earlier sent him a passport which showed residency status but not full nationality, a document not deemed sufficient to save him from deportation to the United States.
The chess legend is famous in Iceland for a 1972 match against Boris Spassky, then a Soviet citizen, in the capital Reykjavik at the height of the Cold War.
On Monday, with Japan looking set to deport Fischer, the parliament in Iceland voted to grant Fischer citizenship.
Japan's Justice Minister Chieko Noono said Tuesday it was "legally possible" to send Fischer to Iceland as long as he gets Icelandic citizenship.
The US government expressed disappointment over Iceland's move, calling Fischer a "fugitive from justice" who had a federal warrant for his arrest.
Supporters of Fischer, who is staying at the Ushiku immigration lock up northeast of Tokyo, have said he has lost weight and become ragged in detention, growing a long beard.
He was placed into solitary confinement for four days earlier this month in a tussle with guards over an egg.
Japan said Tuesday it may let detained chess legend Bobby Fischer leave for Iceland, which offered the maverick genius citizenship to prevent his deportation to the United States where he faces prison.
"I have received a report that according to the immigration control law, it is legally possible to send him there as long as he obtains Iceland citizenship," Justice Minister Chieko Noono told reporters.
"I think immigration authorities will consider the case appropriately," she said without elaborating.
Fischer, 62, was on Monday made a citizen by the parliament of Iceland, where he is famous for a 1972 match.
The American dethroned Boris Spassky, then a Soviet citizen, in the capital Reykjavik at the height of the Cold War.
Fischer, known for his eccentric behavior and outspoken criticism of his country, played a rematch against Spassky in 1992 in Yugoslavia in defiance of US sanctions imposed over the Balkan wars.
He faces 10 years in prison over the chess game if he returns to the United States.
Fischer has been in detention since July when he tried to fly out of Tokyo to the Philippines on his revoked US passport.
All 40 members of Iceland's parliament who cast their votes were in favor of making Fischer a citizen, while two deputies abstained and 21 were absent.
"When I briefed Mr Fischer about the legislation over the phone this morning, he told me, 'Oh good,'" Masako Suzuki, the chess giant's main lawyer, told AFP.
"'Anyway, getting the majority is important,'" Fischer was quoted by the lawyer as saying.
"Now, I am going to ask the Iceland embassy to issue a passport as an Icelandic citizen for him," Suzuki said.
Fischer had previously looked set to be sent to the United States.
Iceland had earlier sent Fischer a passport which showed residency status but not full nationality, a document not deemed sufficient to save him from deportation.
Fischer's supporters say the erstwhile American hero has been singled out for his political views.
Fischer went on Filipino radio on September 11, 2001 to hail the "wonderful news" of the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington and to launch an anti Jewish tirade.
Iceland's decision rejoiced Fischer's supporters so much that they put his name plate on the table at an afternoon press conference in Tokyo hoping the chess legend would be able to attend it.
"Finally we got citizenship for Bobby," his Japanese fiancee Miyoko Watai told the news conference after meeting him Tuesday morning at the Ushiku immigration lock up northeast of the capital.
Fischer's supporters say he has lost weight and become ragged in detention, growing a long beard.
He was placed into solitary confinement for four days earlier this month in a tussle with guards over an egg.
"He lost so much weight and he became aged very fast," his fiancee said in English.
"I think you will be surprised if you see him."
Watai, who heads the Japan Chess Association, became engaged to Fischer after his detention.
She said she planned to move with Fischer to Iceland once he is released.
"We will later consider if our marriage procedures will resume in Iceland as the procedures have been suspended," she said.
Japanese authorities have not accepted their marriage request, as the groom was in custody at the time of application.
After nearly nine months in a Japanese detention cell, chess legend Bobby Fischer appeared to have cleared the final hurdle on his way to freedom Tuesday but Japan's government wasn't immediately ceding defeat.
In a major breakthrough for Fischer, who is being held for allegedly traveling on a revoked U.S. passport, Iceland's parliament on Monday granted the former world champion and notorious eccentric full citizenship, opening the way for him to leave Japan for that country.
Masako Suzuki, one of Fischer's lawyers, said that she expected Fischer to be released within the week.
"Unless something very unexpected happens, that would be the natural course of events," she said.
Iceland is where Fischer won the world championship in 1972, defeating Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union in a classic Cold War showdown that propelled Fischer to international stardom.
Bolstered by the news, supporters visited Fischer at the immigration detention center where he remained in custody on the outskirts of Tokyo.
Miyoko Watai, his longtime companion, said Fischer was "very happy" after hearing the news.
Japanese Justice Minister Chieko Nono was quoted on the daily Yomiuri Shimbun's Web site as saying that if Fischer has been granted Icelandic citizenship, it would be "legally possible to deport him to that country.
We will consider (the possibility)."
Following his arrest in July at Tokyo's Narita airport, Fischer and his team of lawyers had fought an order that he be deported to the United States, where he is wanted for violating international sanctions against the former Yugoslavia by playing a high profile, and lucrative, exhibition match.
Fischer, 62, has since lived up to his reputation as unpredictable he has said he wants to unilaterally renounce his U.S. citizenship, demanded political refugee status and announced that he intends to marry Watai, who heads Japan's chess federation.
None of the moves swayed Japanese officials, however, who took an increasingly hard line position with him.
Fischer's fight took a major turn for the better this month, when a delegation of Icelandic supporters visited him and pushed officials to allow his release.
Iceland's government granted him a special passport, and, when Tokyo indicated that wasn't enough, on Monday granted him full citizenship.
The process still required a formal presidential signature, which was expected later Tuesday, Suzuki said.
"It is clear that there is no need to detain him anymore," she said.
"He wants to leave Japan immediately."
Fischer became an icon when he dethroned Spassky in a series of games in Reykjavik to claim America's first world chess championship in more than a century.
But a few years later he refused to defend the title against another Soviet, Anatoly Karpov.
He then fell into obscurity before resurfacing to play an exhibition rematch against Spassky in the former Yugoslavia in 1992.
Fischer won the rematch on the resort island of Sveti Stefan.
But the match was played in violation of U.S. sanctions imposed to punish then President Slobodan Milosevic.
If convicted, Fischer, who hasn't been to the United States since then, could face 10 years in prison and a fine of US$250000 (euro190000).
A federal grand jury in Washington is also investigating possible money laundering charges involving Fischer, Richard J. Vattuone, one of his lawyers, said this month.
Fischer was reported to have received US$3.5 million from the Spassky rematch.
He boasted at the time that he didn't intend to pay any income tax on the winnings.
It wasn't immediately clear if going to Iceland would help Fischer avoid extradition to the United States if he is charged.
The two countries have an extradition treaty.
"If the United States wants to charge Bobby with something now, 13 years after the event, they are welcome to do so," John Bosnitch, head of the Free Bobby Fischer Committee, told reporters at a news conference.
Though a recluse over the past decade, Fischer has emerged from silence in radio broadcasts and on his Web page to express anti Semitic views and rail against the United States.
His supporters say he is being hounded because of his strongly anti U.S. government views.
"As he did when he won the world chess championship in 1972, Bobby has shown that individual freedom will always win," Bosnitch said earlier in a statement.
Japan said Tuesday it may allow detained chess legend Bobby Fischer, who faces prison if he is deported to the United States, to go to Iceland where he has been granted citizenship.
"I have received a report that according to the immigration control law, it is legally possible to send him there as long as he obtains Iceland citizenship," Justice Minister Chieko Noono told reporters.
"I think immigration authorities will consider the case appropriately," she said without elaborating.

Lawmakers in Iceland are likely to grant citizenship to mercurial chess genius Bobby Fischer, a member of a parliamentary committee studying the issue said Wednesday.
Legislator Gudrun Ogmundsdottir told The Associated Press that a citizenship motion would probably be approved by the nine member committee on Thursday.
If it passes, it will go before Iceland's 63 member parliament, the Althingi.
"I think that parliament may approve of the citizenship as early as tomorrow," said Ogmundsdottir, a member of the opposition Alliance Party.
"Somebody would then go over to Japan with the passport, which would enable him to travel here or anywhere in the world," she added.
Fischer, 62, is in a Japanese detention cell awaiting deportation to the United States, where he is wanted for violating economic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia by playing a highly publicized chess match there in 1992. Mizuho Fukushima, leader of Japan's opposition Social Democratic Party, said senior immigration officials told her that Fischer would be allowed to go to Iceland if he is given citizenship there.
There is widespread support for Fischer in Iceland, where he played the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky in a world championship match in 1972.
Iceland's parliament voted last month against granting Fischer citizenship, offering him a special foreigners' passport and residence permit instead.
But Japanese officials have so far declined to release Fischer.
Several Icelandic politicians indicated Wednesday that parliament was now likely to grant Fischer citizenship.
"I can't speak for the whole party, but think few if any members of Parliament are opposed to granting Fischer citizenship," said Drifa Hjartardottir, a lawmaker with the Independence Party, which governs as part of Iceland's coalition government.
"We will not stand in the way of Fischer getting citizenship and want this issue to be resolved as quickly as possible," said Ogmundur Jonasson, a lawmaker with the Left Green opposition party.
"The worst thing we can do, both for Iceland and for Fischer, is to wait any longer."
Since being taken into custody in July for allegedly trying to leave Japan on a revoked U.S. passport, Fischer has lived up to his reputation for unpredictability.
He has repeatedly denounced the U.S. deportation order as politically motivated, demanded refugee status, unilaterally renounced his U.S. citizenship and said he wants to become a German national instead.
He has also applied to marry a Japanese woman who heads this country's chess association and is his longtime companion.
Einar S. Einarsson, the former CEO of Visa Iceland who is one of Fischer's most fervent supporters, said he was optimistic.
"We're meeting them at 9:40 tomorrow and we want them to take the final step," he said.
"It's been like a chess game and there's only one move left before checkmate."
Iceland's parliament voted Monday to grant Icelandic citizenship to the American chess champion Bobby Fischer, laying the groundwork, his supporters said, for his release from the Japanese prison where he has been detained since last summer.
"We are most happy," said Einar S. Einarsson, spokesman for a committee that has been fighting to allow Fischer to leave Japan, where he is being held in prison while he fights deportation to the United States.
Einarsson, who called Fischer "part of our modern saga and part of our recent history," said that the 62 year old chess champion might be released "in only a few days" and that an Icelandic delegation planned to travel to Tokyo to escort him back to Reykjavik.
Monday's vote appears to be a resolution of sorts to the curious legal limbo that Fischer fell into in 1992, when, the U.S. government says, he violated economic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia by accepting a $3.3 million fee to play an exhibition match there that year.
After that, the always reclusive, progressively more eccentric Fischer dropped out of sight, living in Budapest and, possibly, the Philippines and Switzerland.
Now and then he emerged on radio stations in Iceland, Hungary and the Philippines to rant, in increasingly belligerent terms, against the United States and against Jews.
He surfaced in earnest in July 2004, when he attempted to board a plane from Japan to Manila and was seized by the Japanese authorities.
He was accused of trying to leave the country without a valid passport.
Since then he has been held in prison while various governments, as well as a staunch group of supporters from the chess world, have tried to find a resolution to what has proved a vexing and delicate jurisdictional issue.
But while the United States which is also investigating the possibility of charging him with tax evasion regards Fischer as a fugitive from justice, in Iceland he is seen as a national hero.
It was in Reykjavik in 1972 that he defeated the Russian world champion, Boris Spassky, in an electrifying Cold War chess contest that pitted east against west.
Just as the African American track star Jesse Owens' triumph over Hitler's Aryan athletes did at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Fischer's victory in Iceland seemed to symbolize nothing less than the triumph of one way of life over another in this case, democracy over Communism.
It is partly for that reason, said Bjarni Benediktsson, chairman of the parliamentary committee, who last week recommended that Fischer be granted Icelandic citizenship, that the full parliament voted in favor of his request on Monday.
Iceland had already agreed to issue a resident's permit and special passport to Fischer, but these alone did not prove enough for the Japanese authorities.
Fischer's supporters said they had received assurances from Japan that, with full Icelandic citizenship and passport, he would be free to leave the country.
"It was very clear from the outset that he had a great influence here," Benediktsson said of Fischer, speaking by telephone from Reykjavik.
"A new generation of international chess players was born here in Iceland after the world championship match in Reykjavik, and it was very clear from the outset of this matter that the authorities in Iceland have very warm feelings toward this memory."
Benediktsson emphasized that the granting of citizenship was considered only as a last resort, "after the applicant had exhausted all other possibilities" of gaining freedom.
He also said that Fischer's "personal opinions on social issues" had not entered into his government's decision.
In a telephone interview, Einarsson played down the significance of Fischer's reputation for misanthropy and his habit of making incendiary public remarks.
"Everyone knows his views, and he doesn't need to repeat them again," Einarsson said.
"He's like Rembrandt or Mozart, one of these very big people, so his personality is beside the point."
Einarsson said that Fischer was likely to make Iceland his home, at least for the time being.
"I think he will stay in Iceland a lot, at least for the coming months, and then he will travel freely around the world although I don't expect he will be going to America."
A parliamentary committee voted Friday to grant citizenship to fugitive U.S. chess star Bobby Fischer, putting the issue up for a vote by all legislators.
"The matter has been finished," said Gudrun Oegmundsdpttir, a member the General Committee.
"It will now go before the parliament on Monday for the vote."

Iceland's parliament voted Monday to grant citizenship to fugitive U.S. chess star Bobby Fischer.
The legislation, passed with 40 lawmakers voting "aye" and two abstaining following a brief debate, became law immediately.
"I am very pleased with this, and I think that the dignity of the parliament has increased," Fischer's supporter Saemundur Palsson said.
He said Fischer, 62, would be informed of the vote Tuesday morning in Japan, where he has been detained awaiting deportation to the United States on a warrant for violating economic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia by playing a chess match there in 1992.
"I hope that he will stop cursing the Americans now.
It has gotten him into so much trouble," Palsson said.
Einar S. Einarsson, another of Fischer's key supporters, said he spoke to the mercurial chess genius earlier Monday.
Fischer hoped the vote process would be quick, Einarsson said, and "I don't think it could have been much quicker."
The bill went through the required three readings in 12 minutes.
Officials at the Office of Immigration said a passport for Fischer could be ready as early as Tuesday.

In Washington, the State Department had no comment on the case, although a spokesman noted that renunciation of American citizenship did not allow citizens to escape prosecution of crimes in the United States.

This latest episode began in July 2004, when he tried to board a plane from Japan to Manila and was seized by the Japanese authorities and accused of trying to leave the country on an invalid passport.
He has been held in prison since then while the various governments, as well as a staunch group of supporters in the chess world, have tried to find some resolution to what has been a vexing and delicate jurisdictional issue.

He also said Fischer's "personal opinions on social issues" had not been a factor.
In Tokyo, the Committee to Free Bobby Fischer praised the Icelandic Parliament, saying it had "made history by standing up to the earth's sole superpower."
"This is a historic battle pitting the world's sole superpower bully against one lone man who had the courage to fight for his own freedom to think and speak as he chooses," John Bosnitch, chairman of the group, said in a statement.
In a telephone interview, Einarsson played down the significance of Fischer's reputation for misanthropy and his habit of making incendiary public remarks.

Chess genius Bobby Fischer, now in a Japanese detention cell awaiting deportation to the United States, will be allowed to leave Japan for Iceland if that country grants him citizenship, an opposition party leader said Wednesday.
Mizuho Fukushima, head of the Social Democratic Party, said senior immigration officials told her that Fischer could go to Iceland instead of the United States if he is given citizenship there.
Fischer is wanted by Washington for violating economic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia when he played a high profile chess match at a resort there in 1992.
"They said that if he had citizenship, there would be no problem," she said after the meeting with immigration officials.
Fukushima, a member of Parliament, later met with Iceland's ambassador to Tokyo.
Iceland recently issued Fischer a special passport and residence permit to help resolve the standoff over his status.
Fischer became world chess champion in a 1972 match in Iceland against the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky, and some of his Icelandic supporters have campaigned to help him out of gratitude for putting Iceland in the global spotlight.
The Iceland passport is one used by foreigners, however.
Iceland's parliament voted two weeks ago against granting Fischer citizenship, and it's unclear whether lawmakers plan to reconsider this.
"The decision on citizenship lies with Parliament," said Illugi Gunnarsson, an advisor to the Foreign Minister David Oddsson.
Since being taken into custody in July for allegedly trying to leave the country on a revoked U.S. passport, Fischer has lived up to his reputation as unpredictable.
He has repeatedly denounced the U.S. deportation order as politically motivated, demanded refugee status, unilaterally renounced his U.S. citizenship and said he wants to become a German national instead.
He has also applied to marry a Japanese woman who heads this country's chess association and is his longtime companion.
Officials, meanwhile, have taken a hard line with him.
Fischer, 62, is being held in detention just outside Tokyo pending the outcome of a lawsuit challenging the deportation order.
Officials say they do not know how much longer that could take.
Most detainees at the center are deported or allowed to leave Japan within about one month, but Fischer has been in custody for eight months.
Fukushima said Fischer, an outspoken critic of the U.S. government, was being treated unfairly.
"There is no need to keep him in detention," she said.
"If this was any other person, I'm sure it would have turned out differently."
Her protest came after a member of Japan's leading opposition party, the Democrats, grilled government officials in Parliament over the case.
Fukushima said her party also intended to pursue the issue further in parliamentary debate.
During questioning in Parliament on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura denied allegations Tokyo is trying to please the United States by being tough.
"I do not recall being asked by the United States to do anything about Fischer," Machimura told the committee.
"So I don't think the Justice Ministry is interpreting the law out of consideration for the United States."
A parliamentary committee in Iceland voted to grant citizenship to fugitive U.S. chess star Bobby Fischer, putting the issue up for a vote by all legislators.
"The matter has been finished," Gudrun Oegmundsdottir, a member the General Committee, said after Friday's vote.
"It will now go before the parliament on Monday for the vote."
Fischer, 62, has been detained in Japan awaiting deportation to the United States, where he is wanted for violating economic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia by playing a highly publicized chess match there in 1992.
One of Fischer's supporters in Iceland said the Japanese government had confirmed it would allow him to go to Iceland if citizenship was granted.
"This is great news," said Fischer supporter Saemundur Palsson.
"They had been waiting on confirmation from Japan that Fischer would be let go if he had Icelandic citizenship.
This arrived to me this morning."
There is widespread support for Fischer in Iceland, where he played the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky in a world championship match in 1972.

"We are currently organizing a fundraising for the party that will go out to meet him," said Einar Einarsson, former CEO of VISA Iceland and one of Fischers strongest supporters.
"We might need to bring his girlfriend Miyoko Watai over too, as well as John Bosnitch, his supporter now in Japan, so there are expenses involved," Einarsson said.
"Fischer has money, but he can't get at it from where he is now."
Chess legend Bobby Fischer, who faces prison if he returns to the United States, can only avoid deportation from Japan if Iceland upgrades its granting of residency to full citizenship, a Japanese lawmaker said Wednesday.
Mizuho Fukushima, head of the opposition Social Democratic Party, told a press conference that Japanese immigration officials are opting to deport Fischer to the United States unless Iceland grants him nationality.
Fischer, 62, known for his maverick behavior and outspoken criticism of his country, may face 10 years in prison if convicted of violating US sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia by playing there in 1992.
Fukushima met Masaharu Miura, chief of the justice ministry's immigration bureau, who had told parliament Tuesday that the chess genius could only be deported to his country of origin the United States.
The socialist leader said of the prospect of Fischer going to Iceland: "Mr Miura told us that it would be okay if Iceland gives him citizenship.
"The Social Democratic Party will bring up the issue at the parliament and will work to let the Japanese public know about the case," she said.
Iceland has offered residency to Fischer, who is famous in Reykjavik for dethroning the Soviet Boris Spassky there in 1972 at the height of the Cold War.
Iceland has sent him a passport which shows residency status but it has not offered him nationality.
Socialist leader Fukushima, who is also a well known human rights lawyer, is scheduled to meet the Icelandic ambassador on Thursday.
Fischer's supporters accuse the United States of piling pressure both on Japan and Iceland so it can get ahold of the chess legend.
The supporters say Fischer would not receive a fair trial in the United States due to his controversial past statements, such as hailing the September 11, 2001 attacks as "wonderful news" and anti Jewish remarks.
"Mr Fischer would be free if he were not Mr Fischer," said Masako Suzuki, his lawyer.
But even if Iceland offered Fischer citizenship, his case would still be in legal limbo because of his US nationality.
An immigration official at the justice ministry said that a person with two nationalities is usually deported to the country whose passport he or she used to enter Japan.
That would mean the United States for Fischer.
Fischer has been held since July when he attempted to fly out of Japan on an allegedly invalid US passport, but from detention he has been unable to renounce his US citizenship.
A renunciation would make him a man without a country.
He has sought political asylum in Japan and applied for a German passport on account of his German father, but neither route has been successful.
Fukushima said justice ministry officials told her that they had not discussed Fischer's case with their US nor Icelandic counterparts, after opposition allegations that Japan was caving in to US pressure.
Fischer is little known in Japan.
The media has largely ignored his plight even though in detention he became engaged to the head of the Japan Chess Association.
A parliamentary committee met here Thursday to discuss granting citizenship to Bobby Fischer, but made no decision, saying it needed more information from Japan, where the mercurial chess genius is being held in custody.
Legislator Gudrun Ogmundsdottir had said the citizenship motion would probably be passed by the nine member committee Thursday, then be placed before Iceland's 63 member parliament, the Althingi.
But during Thursday's meeting the committee said it was awaiting more documents from Japan to be sure he would be let go if given citizenship in Iceland.
If so, an Icelandic passport would be delivered to Fischer in Japan, enabling him to travel wherever he wanted.
The parliamentary committee is expected to meet again soon.
Fischer, 62, is in a Japanese detention cell awaiting deportation to the United States, where he is wanted for violating economic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia by playing a highly publicized chess match there in 1992. Mizuho Fukushima, leader of Japan's opposition Social Democratic Party, said senior immigration officials told her that Fischer would be allowed to go to Iceland if he is given citizenship there.
There is widespread support for Fischer in Iceland, where he played the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky in a world championship match in 1972.
Iceland's parliament voted last month against granting Fischer citizenship, offering him a special foreigners' passport and residence permit instead.
But Japanese officials have so far declined to release Fischer.
Several Icelandic politicians indicated Wednesday that parliament was now likely to grant Fischer citizenship.
"I can't speak for the whole party, but think few if any members of Parliament are opposed to granting Fischer citizenship," said Drifa Hjartardottir, a lawmaker with the Independence Party, which governs as part of Iceland's coalition government.
"We will not stand in the way of Fischer getting citizenship and want this issue to be resolved as quickly as possible," said Ogmundur Jonasson, a lawmaker with the Left Green opposition party.
"The worst thing we can do, both for Iceland and for Fischer, is to wait any longer."
Since being taken into custody in July for allegedly trying to leave Japan on a revoked U.S. passport, Fischer has lived up to his reputation for unpredictability.
He has repeatedly denounced the U.S. deportation order as politically motivated, demanded refugee status, unilaterally renounced his U.S. citizenship and said he wants to become a German national instead.
He has also applied to marry a Japanese woman who heads this country's chess association and is his longtime companion.
Chess legend Bobby Fischer was on Monday granted citizenship by the parliament of Iceland, a move which could allow him to avoid deportation from Japan to the United States where he is wanted for violating sanctions against the former Yugoslavia.
"It is done.
The decision is valid from today," Atli Gislason, a deputy from the Left Green movement, told AFP.
Fischer, 62, who is in detention in Japan, faces prison if he returns to the United States.
The former grandmaster, known for his maverick behavior and outspoken criticism of the United States, may face 10 years in prison if convicted of violating US sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia by playing there in 1992.
But last week Mizuho Fukushima, head of the Japanese opposition Social Democratic Party, told a press conference that Japanese immigration officials would not deport Fischer to the United States if Iceland grants him nationality.
All 40 members of parliament who cast their votes were in favour of the motion to grant Fischer citizenship, while two deputies abstained, and 21 were absent.
Iceland had previously sent Fischer a passport which showed residency status but not full nationality, a document not deemed sufficient to save him from deportation to the United States.
Fischer's link to Iceland dates back to 1972, when he defeated Russian Boris Spassky in a world championship match, which ended a long domination of the game by Soviet players and was hailed as a Cold War victory in his native United States.
He was taken into custody in Japan last July for trying to leave the country on an invalid US passport.
India's western state of Maharashtra banned the sale and use of plastic bags Wednesday, saying they were the main cause of blocked drains during week long floods which killed 1099 people.
Environmentalists and urban planners have blamed the flooding caused by unprecedented monsoon rains in the state's capital Mumbai in July on poor drainage.
"These (plastic bags) tend to choke drainage and sewage systems.
The cabinet has now decided to ban the sale and usage of plastic bags in the state," the state's Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said at the state assembly.
"In the recent floods, the collected water could not flow out properly due to poor drainage systems," he said.
Mumbai, a city of 15 million people and the financial and entertainment capital of the country, has a century old drainage system built by India's former British colonial rulers.
The poor drainage system clogged with plastic bags and garbage combined with unchecked development along natural inland waterways, Deshmukh said.
"The situation will not improve until we stop using plastic bags," he said.
People had to wade through stagnant water during the floods which led to the outbreak of water borne diseases across Mumbai and neighbouring areas, killing more than 315 people after the water receded.
However, companies can continue to make plastic bags in the state as long as they are sold elsewhere, Deshmukh said.
"The manufacture of plastic will be allowed (in Maharashtra) and these may be sold only outside the state," Deshmukh said.
A period of 30 days would be provided to hear public opinion and suggestions, he added.
The plastics manufacturing industry said it would oppose the government's move.
"Plastics usage is not the culprit.
The civic administration failed to ensure proper roads and effective drainage systems.
If plastics usage was the issue, why was south Mumbai not flooded," said Harpal Singh, president of the Plastics manufacturing industry nationwide.
There are 1800 small units manufacturing plastic bags across the country, Singh said.
Changing people's mindset is the key to reducing the use of plastic bags, Hong Kong's Secretary for Environment, Transport and Works Sarah Liao said on Monday, adding Hong Kong's supermarkets will offer more incentives to urge customers use fewer plastic bags.
Speaking on a talkshow of a local radio station, Liao said the proposed plastic bag tax was a complex issue which had to be examined carefully.
On the plastic bags recovery trial, Liao noted dozens of housing estates and supermarkets had joined the scheme, which has cut the plastic bag use by 5 percent.
The government is liaising with supermarkets on providing more incentives to customers to reduce plastic bag use, and a new promotion will be launched soon, she added.
Liao stressed there was a need to introduce product responsibility schemes to lower the environmental risks, and the battery recycling scheme launched last week has shown manufacturers, importers, retailers and consumers are willing to share the responsibility.
She said product responsibility schemes on tires and rechargeable batteries are being explored, while studies on drink containers and electrical appliances will be carried out this year.
A ban against bistros providing plastic bags free of charge will be lifted at the beginning of March, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) announced Monday.
The EPA has recently amended its policy of restricting the use of plastic bags and disposable dining utensils after evidence showed the policy has failed to cut short plastic consumption since its implementation July 1, 2001.
According to official tallies, plastic bags used by bistros has skyrocketed, surging from 5793 tons per year before the implementation of plastic restrictions to the current level of over 10000 tons, EPA officials said.
Under the original policy, six different types of businesses and shops department stores and shopping centers, wholesale stores, supermarkets, chain convenience stores, chain fast food stores, and bistros and restaurants were banned from offering customers plastic bags thinner than 0.06 mm and from offering free plastic bags with a thickness of over 0.06mm.
Consumers were required to pay for plastic bags over 0.06mm thick, and the use of "thick" plastic bags led to the growth of plastic consumption due to Taiwanese people's special dining customs, EPA officials said.
For instance, it is common for people to contain and carry food in plastic bags, which are mostly unrecyclable after carrying greasy food.
The amended policy therefore resumed the use of thin plastic bags at bistros and restaurants as part of efforts to curb plastic consumption.
Other business stores are not subject to the ban's suspension.
Meanwhile, encouraged by the fact that the amount of disposable plastic tableware used actually shrank 85 percent since the EPA began putting into place plastic restrictions over three years ago, the administration is scheduled to impose a ban on governmental agencies and schools from using disposable tableware at dining places on July 1.
It is estimated that the new ban will contribute to a reduced consumption of some 2600 tons of plastic per year.
The EPA proposed the amended policy Monday, which also rules a ban against the use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in the production of all kinds of packing bags and cling films.
PVC is described by Greenpeace International as a "toxic plastic" because it produces toxic substances at every stage of its manufacture, consumption and dumping.
Taiwan's PVC demand has amounted to around 700000 tons annually.
From September, the ban on PVC use will be put into effect, according to the amended policy.
The French Ecology Ministry launched on Monday a program designed to reduce household rubbish by 15 percent over the next five years and by nearly a third by 2015.
French Ecology Minister Nelly Olin urged the public to spurn supermarket plastic bags and to think about the increasing amount of plastic packages they are throwing out daily.
According to the ecology ministry, each one in France now throws out, on the average, 360 kilo of trash a year and only 12 percent is recycled and 6 percent transformed into compost, far behind its neighbor countries like Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands, which all have household waste recycling systems.
The program will cost 2.5 million euros, said the ministry.
The government of the western Indian state of Maharashtra on Wednesday banned the manufacture, sale and use of all plastic bags, saying they choked drainage systems during recent monsoon rains.
Environmental groups welcomed the ban, but said it wasn't enough.
Plastic manufacturers said 100000 people would lose their jobs.
Manufacturers and stores selling plastic bags will be fined 5000 rupees (US$111, euro92), while individuals using bags face penalties of 1000 rupees (US$22, euro18), said the state's top elected official, Vilasrao Deshmukh.
Deshmukh said the ban was prompted by the indiscriminate use of plastic bags, which blocked sewage and drainage systems during record monsoon rains in July.
Flooding and landslides killed more than 1000 people in the state.
The ban is to take effect Sept 24.
Until then, residents of the state can file objections and suggestions, Deshmukh said.
Other Indian states have already banned the use of thin plastic bags 20 microns or .002 centimeters thick used by shoppers.
Last month, some prominent Bombay residents, including movie producers, sued the state government for responding slowly to the crisis created by record rains last month that paralyzed India's financial and entertainment capital.
Residents blame haphazard planning, bad drainage and poor roads for the flooding and landslides.
"The ban is long overdue and very welcome," said Debi Goenka, an environmentalist with the Bombay Environmental Action Group.
Bombay is the capital of Maharashtra state.
"But to say the flooding was just because of plastic bags is stupid," Goenka said.
"This has to be a first step."
Environmental groups have demanded preservation of open spaces and regular cleaning of drains and garbage.
Arvind Mehta, managing committee member of the All India Plastic Manufacturers Association, said more than 1000 manufacturing plants would be forced to shut down in the state, putting 100000 people out of work.
"The government is passing the buck.
We are being made scapegoats," Mehta said.
"The waste management system and people's littering habits should be corrected."
Kenya's largest supermarket chain said Wednesday it has begun using new biodegradable bags in response to growing environmental concerns about pollution by discarded flimsy plastic shopping containers.
"We are trying to keep away any hazards and it's also part of our social responsibility to care for the environment," said Mercury Anyango, a spokeswoman for Nakumatt, Kenya's leading retailer of groceries and household products.
The biodegradable bags, which were launched last week, are also plastic but specially treated to make them decompose more quickly than older versions which can 1000 years to disintegrate, she told AFP.
"Nakumatt started using the new product because the normal plastic bag is a problem for the evironment and has therefore chosen to support the world environment program by using the degradable bags for packing goods," she added.
Nakumatt uses more than 30 million bags every year at a cost of over 40 million shillings (524 million dollars) and Anyango said the change will cost 20 percent more.
In February, the Nairobi based UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and Kenyan Nobel Peace laureate Wangari Maathai warned that Kenya faced a growing public health risk from the sea of bags swamping the country.
Plastic shopping bags that are not disposed of properly block gutters and drains, choke farm animals and marine wildlife and pollute the soil, they said.
In addition, they "provide several million habitats for mosquitoes to breed that increase the risk of malaria," Maathai said at the time, noting that the disease was a leading cause of infant mortality in Kenya and throughout Africa.
According to the state run Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis (KIPPRA) and the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA), at least two million plastic bags are distributed each year to people shopping in supermarkets and kiosks in Nairobi alone.
Another supermarket chain, China Resources Vanguard, announced here Thursday to reduce distribution of plastic shopping bags.
This is the third voluntary agreement signed after similar agreements with Wellcome and PARKnSHOP in February and March.
China Resources Vanguard pledged to reduce plastic bag distribution at its retail outlets by at least 15 percent in one year.
Hong Kong Permanent Secretary for Environment, Transport & Works Keith Kwok said the government is pleased to see the three major supermarket chains are committed to reducing plastic bags by about 90 million in a year.
"We are also encouraging other supermarkets and major retail chains to join the voluntary scheme," Kwok said.
The active involvement of supermarket chains will help change consumer behavior over time, he said, adding a large number of plastic shopping bags are disposed of at landfills each day.
The implementation of voluntary agreements will reduce this kind of waste at the source.
In the longer term, the government plans to prohibit free distribution of plastic bags and impose a levy to deter their use through legislation.
It will consult the trade and the public before taking it forward, Kwok said.
Japan announced a draft plan Monday to stop retailers from giving out plastic bags for free amid efforts to improve the environment in the nation where the landmark Kyoto Protocol was sealed.
The proposal by the environment ministry would cut back on Japan's widespread use of plastic bags either through legislation or agreements with industry to end free distribution.
"If everything goes as scheduled, the bill to ban free distribution of plastic bags will be sent to the parliament in 2006 at the earliest," an environment ministry official said.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry plans to present its own report on the bag issue on Thursday after which the two ministries will finalize details.
Plastic bags are regularly distributed without asking by Japanese merchants.
According to a survey by the Kyoto government, 10 percent of the plastic garbage in the western city comes from bags given by retailers.
"There are no similar nationwide statistics, but we expect charging for plastic bags will reduce a significant amount of garbage from households," the environment ministry official said.
The Japanese government faces an uphill battle to meet its target under the Kyoto Protocol of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions six percent by 2008 2012 from the 1990 level.
It hopes to achieve the goal partly by reducing the amount of household rubbish.
A Bangladeshi national task force has recommended the law against the use of polythene shopping bags should be strictly enforced and measures should be taken to popularize jute bags.
"Law enforcers should strictly and regularly block market entrance of polythene bags and nylon net bags being widely used recently," the task force was quoted by New Age as saying on Thursday.
The task force formed in January recommended that a technology of making shopping bag of yarn, innovated by the Jute Research Institute, should be forwarded for commercial production, New Age reported.
It stressed the need for widespread media campaign to make people aware of environmental hazards of polythene bags and motivate them to use safer alternatives.
Polythene bag came into Bangladeshi market in 1982 and became more popular than other bags for its low price and easy portability.
But they have been blamed for a number of environmental hazards including water contamination, clogging of drains and sewerage lines in and around the cities and soil degradation across the country.
Considering the rapid environmental degradation caused by polythene, civil societies launched a movement against it and finally the government declared a ban on the production, distribution and marketing of such shopping bags with effect from Jan 1, 2002.
But the banned polythene bags staged a comeback in different forms and types as no suitable, low cost and user friendly alternatives can be promoted so far in wider scale.
Nylon net bags have also made their way recently.
Taiwan conservationists Tuesday protested at a government decision partially to lift a ban on free plastic bags, saying the move is a setback for environmental protection efforts.
The cabinet level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) announced Monday that from March 1, private restaurants will be allowed to distribute plastic bags to customers free of charge.
"This is a big step backward in domestic environmental education," said Chou Chun ti, head of an environmental protection body grouping mothers.
The EPA launched the first stage of a two part ban in July 2002 when public catering facilities including canteens in government and state enterprises, military units, schools and public hospitals stopped using polystyrene and were banned from using plastic bags.
The second stage was imposed in January 2003 on private restaurants and shops including department stores, supermarkets and fast food outlets.
EPA officials found that over the past year, private restaurants which consume at least half Taiwan's plastic bags had ignored the ban since the agency had too few staff to implement the policy thoroughly.
"The EPA should figure out some solutions to solve the problems rather than dropping it when it has been half way done," Chou said.
The EPA said the overall policy had been a success because the amount of used plastic bags has been reduced to 19000 tonnes each year, from 27000 tonnes previously.
Environmental activists have long complained that Taiwan is drowning in a sea of plastic, with more than 16 million bags a day handed out on the island.
LOS ANGELES Paper or plastic?
It might not matter soon.
Supermarket shoppers could end up paying for selecting either bag if Los Angeles politicians follow a San Francisco proposal and the advice of some environmentalists to recoup the cost of cleaning up grocery sack litter.
San Francisco officials are considering a fee of 17 cents per bag in a bid to encourage Bay Area shoppers to bring their own sacks.
Los Angeles city leaders also want to get rid of grocery bag blight.
Hoping to avoid drastic measures, Councilman Ed Reyes wants manufacturers of plastics and officials in grocery chains to partner with him on bag cleanups and recycling programs.
"San Francisco has the wherewithal to charge that much.
San Francisco has a different income group," Reyes said.
"Here in Los Angeles, I would rather work with the industry before we get into that."
Reyes' proposal to create a task force on plastic bags will likely go to the full City Council next week after being approved Wednesday by the council's Environmental Quality and Waste Management Committee.
Reyes hopes the task force will hold its first meeting in March and produce recommendations 60 days later.
So far, plastics industry representatives have said they will participate in Reyes' task force particularly in light of the proposed fee in San Francisco, which they oppose.
"The bag manufacturers in the last few years have gotten together and realize there is an issue," said Donna Dempsey, executive director of the Film and Bag Federation.
"We're willing to work toward that goal."
All sides agree that plastic bags are a blight on the Los Angeles River, where hundreds of white sacks float on the shallow water, stick to rocks and dangle like Spanish moss from tree branches.
City officials were spurred to action by a new mandate to cut trash from the river and from Ballona Creek by 10 percent each year, starting this year, at an estimated cost of $120 million.
Plastics make up more than half of all the trash in the river, and plastic bags alone constitute slightly more than one third of the litter.
Unlike paper or wood or other organic garbage, plastics don't biodegrade.
They cause environmental damage by breaking into smaller pieces that are eaten by fish and wildlife.
Plastic bags also clog the screens installed on storm drains that filter trash from runoff.
"Plastic is the single most important component of the litter.
It's also the most environmentally damaging," said Kosta Kaporis, an engineer with the Bureau of Sanitation.
"It's aesthetically the worst."
Los Angeles River ad hoc committee staffer Lupe Vela is in charge of task force preparation and hopes to bring industry representatives to the table first to see if they can develop voluntary programs.
Right now only about 5 percent of the plastic used in grocery bags is recycled.
Some grocery stores have bins in which to deposit used bags, and some offer a discount 5 cents or less for shoppers who bring their own bags.
And bags can't be mixed with curbside recyclables.
They stick to bottles and cans, and they clog sorting equipment.
Yet there is a demand for the raw material by companies that use old sacks to make more bags or plastic building materials.
The task force will likely talk about ways to collect and recycle bags.
Members are virtually certain to consider public education campaigns to get people to stop littering, to bring their own reusable bags when they shop, and to participate in neighborhood cleanup programs.
But some question whether voluntary, public private programs will deliver the kind of dramatic cut in plastic litter that is needed for the city of Los Angeles to meet trash regulations.
"I'm skeptical that the plastics industry is going to be capable of coming up with a solution that involves fewer numbers of plastic bags being sold," said Mark Murray, executive director of Californians Against Waste, which has pushed San Francisco and Los Angeles authorities to consider fee per bag systems.
He points to the success in Ireland, where use of plastic bags dropped by 90 percent a year after the nation imposed a fee of 15 cents per bag.
Though Reyes champions the partnership with industry and the community now, he said he is open to tougher means to get bags out of the Los Angeles River.
"Maybe we'll come up with a fine or a tax for the plastic bags, and give the bag some value, so people will think twice before throwing it on the streets."
The Ugandan government is considering a total ban on polythene bags after a 50 percent excise duty has failed to reduce their production and usage, reported local press on Tuesday.
Minister of State for Trade Richard Nduhura was quoted as saying that the rampant use of polythene bags has led to environmental disasters like blockage of drainages, suffocation of children and animals and soil degradation.
"An excise duty of 50 percent was imposed on plastics in June 2002.
It has not deterred indiscriminate use of the plastics, prompting us to take drastic measures," Nduhura said at a meeting on plastics waste management and development of environmentally degradable plastics in Kampala which was attended by delegates from eight African countries.
He added that the government was still looking at optional measures like controlling importation, production, usage and disposal of polythene bags.
I've gotten more than 70 e mails responding to my Tuesday column about the San Francisco Commission on the Environment's resolution urging the Board of Supervisors to force supermarkets in the city to charge shoppers 17 cents apiece for bags.
Roughly one third of these readers love the idea, saying it will cut down on waste and trash.
Some say the proposal doesn't go far enough, that fees should apply to other stores and bags.
Roughly one third hate the idea, saying it's a government plot to raise taxes.
The remaining third might warm to the idea, but have some questions and reservations.
Today, I'll share some of these comments, but after this, please, no more feedback on bag fees.
The European scene: More than a dozen e mails came from people who live or have lived in Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, Norway or South Africa, where charging for shopping bags is common.
Virtually all of them said it's a minor expense or inconvenience, but well worth it.
"My native Germany charges a fee for these bags, and people respond in the best way for the environment they bring their own tote bags!
When I came to the U.S. seven years ago, I was astonished (and disgusted) by the practice of using new bags on each trip.
And while I have to admit that I easily fell into this behavior myself, the proposed legislation reminded me that bringing my own tote bag is an easy way to be a good citizen of our one and only planet Earth," says Franziska Marks.
"I am an Irish citizen living in S.F.
I remember the same excuses being trotted out when this was first introduced in Ireland (in 2002).
The key difference is that the retailers embraced this change as a way to tout their 'green' credentials by offering a free, sturdy shopping tote to each club member for a limited time to carry their groceries (enabling free advertising).
It really has dramatically reduced the level of plastic bag waste all over the country," writes Ray Walsh.
Pooper scoopers: Many readers told me they put their old bags to good use.
One even sent me a photo of her kitchen recycling center, rigged to hold plastic bags.
"Everybody I know uses plastic grocery bags for garbage bags.
They use them to go to the dog park, empty the kitty litter, and a dozen other things.
If you don't get plastic bags with your groceries, then you would have to buy plastic bags.
So it sort of defeats the purpose," writes Jim Knowles of Alameda.
"Considering the estimated 85000 dogs in San Francisco, has anyone factored the additional citywide expense in cleaning up poo that people will refuse to pick up in a 17 cent bag three times a day?" asks Melinda Graves.
"For about eight years, I have reused bags many times because I want to do my part for our environment.
In fact, for one month, I kept count of how many times I reused a single bag.
Seventeen times in one month meant that 17 bags were not sent to the dump!" writes Charlotte Pederson.
I feel a book coming on: "101 Uses for Old Bags."
Fuzzy math?
My column explained that the San Francisco Department of the Environment came up with the 17 cents by dividing the environmental cost of used grocery bags ($8.5 million annually) by the estimated number of plastic and paper bags distributed in San Francisco supermarkets each year (50 million).
The $8.5 million is the departments' estimate of what it costs the city to sweep up and dispose of bags, plus what it costs Norcal Waste Systems to remove plastic bags from its recycling and composting system.
Some readers point out that city residents already pay for these costs through taxes and garbage collection fees.
"Shouldn't the amount that is presently being paid for garbage service be taken into consideration when determining how much it really costs the city?
Or are residents supposed to pay twice for the same service?" asks David Schnapf.
Engineer Neil Lillemark says the city's calculation ignores two facts: Some of the 50 million bags distributed each year get reused and don't go immediately into the waste stream, and a fee would cut bag consumption (and thus the city's costs).
Using certain assumptions, he suggests that "10 cents a bag would be a more fair estimate of the charge which should be applied if they were to go this route."
Some readers suggested it would be more economically efficient to ban free bags, but to allow grocers to sell them for those who forget or choose not to use their own.
That would eliminate the cost of creating a system to collect, track and distribute the fees.
Mark Westlund, spokesman for the environment department, said the 17 cent fee is not set in stone, and if a bag fee went into effect, a reduction in taxes and/or garbage fees "certainly could be on the table."
He adds that the department "would be open to any ideas that would address the issue."
Bad bagger behavior: Several readers said grocers could reduce waste if they simply instructed their baggers to use fewer sacks.
"Baggers can be careless, often double bagging for no reason, or putting one or two items in a bag that could have fit into another bag.
It's probably faster to use a lot of bags instead of trying to figure out how to make the best use of each bag, but it's so wasteful," says Sarah Stockton of Daly City.
Paul Smith, a vice president of the California Grocers Association, explains: "We try to minimize breakage to product."
If a bag breaks when a customer is moving it from store to car or car to kitchen, most stores that are members of his association will replace the contents for free.
"There are marketing reasons why we do this," he says.
However, "There are retailers who are right now evaluating their clerk and bagger training to (encourage) reduction of bags."
Good question: Ford Kanzler of El Granada writes: "I've often wondered why food markets don't sell reusable cloth bags at the check stand (along with) all the impulse purchase junk."
Who knows where that bag has been?
Mike McHugh fears reusing bags may be unhealthful.
"A new bag is clean!
Customers can return home with their items confident that their purchases have been protected from dirt and germs.
An old reused bag cannot guarantee such a situation.
It may be dirty, even if you can't see the dirt with your eyes.
It might have held raw meat that may have bled ever so little onto the sides of the bag.
The bag might even have previously been used to carry poisonous substances!" he writes.
Point of interest: When Ireland imposed a 15 cent charge on all plastic shopping bags in 2002, it exempted a number of bags, including those that hold raw meat.
Why just supermarkets?
Some readers wonder why the proposal applies only to grocers.
"Saving the environment can be done in many ways," writes Catherine Ying.
"Instead of making our life more complicated by charging for shopping bags, why don't we start with something that is more of a luxury, such as Diaper Genie," which wraps dirty disposable diapers in plastic bags.
"What about stores like Walgreens that try to put every little item in a bag even if the customer is a woman with a large handbag," writes Beth Wells of San Francisco.
And how about restaurants that put food "in those toxic Styrofoam boxes and then put the box in a bag."
"What bugs me is that my Chronicle is delivered every day in a plastic bag.
They are limited in their re use I don't have a dog and don't travel that often, as they make excellent wrappers for shoes or slippers," writes Doug Stewart.
Chris Blaser, The Chronicle's circulation vice president responds: "Our policy is to only deliver newspapers in plastic bags on rainy/heavy fog days.
Our other general rule is to bag when the forecast is mixed.
"We do, however, have some carriers who bag more frequently (of their own initiative) in an effort to assure that the paper is in good condition.
We do notify any of these carriers to stop bagging (except on rainy days) whenever we receive a call from a customer.
We also make sure the plastic bags we buy come primarily from recycled materials."
Westlund says the city might consider extending bag fees "to other areas like fast foods, drug stores, etc. Right now (it's) strictly supermarkets."
Tanzania is on the way to handle the increasing plastic waste through establishing a recycling plant believed to be the first one in east and central Africa.
Minister for Industry and Trade Juma Ngasongwa was quoted by local newspaper Daily News on Thursday as saying that the Tanzanian government has set aside 1.5 million US dollars to operate the recycling plant as the first phase of the country's multi million dollar anti plastic litter project.
The plant is expected to start operating in May this year, with the capacity of recycling every day about 10 tons of plastic bags, bottles and other industrial waste from collection centers.
Plastic litter has become an environmental hazard in the east African country where the public have not been made aware of disposal methods.
The abandoned plastic bags and containers can be spotted in many towns, blamed for clogging sewage and drainage systems.
It is also reported that cows died after eating this material.
Kenya is being swamped with a flood of discarded plastic shopping bags that pose a growing public health risk and should take steps to ban the popular lould be banned and a hefty levy slapped on thicker ones to rid Kenya of an increasing environmental and health menace," the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said.
The call came in a study of Kenya's solid waste management presented to UNEP governors who are currently meeting at the agency's headquarters here and was backed by Wangari Maathai, last year's Nobel Peace Prize.
Discarded plastic bags "provide several million habitats for mosquitoes to breed that increase the risk of malaria," she said, noting that the disease was a leading cause of infant mortality in Kenya and throughout Africa.
Maathai, who serves as Kenya's deputy environment minister, pledged to push the Kenyan government to adopt measures to reduce the use of plastic bags.
Earlier this week, Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki told UNEP officials that his government would address the problem posed by the bags but Maathai said she wanted action now.
"If I had my way, we would have started that immediately" she told reporters.
In addition to exacerbating the mosquito problem, plastic bags block gutters and drains, choke farm animals and marine wildlife, pollute the soil, can ruin Kenya's dramatic natural vistas and can take 20 to 1000 years to decompose.
In Europe, Ireland introduced a similar bid to cut down the use of plastic bags in March 2002, then dubbed a "plastax".
By August that year, shoppers had already cut the use of plastic bags by 90 percent, the environment ministry announced.
The government announced that the funds raised from a tax on plastic bags would be used for an office for environment enforcement, implementing a national waste prevention programme and the disposal of fridges and freezers.
Rwanda and South Africa are moving towards a similar policy, according to UNEP officials.
The state run Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis (KIPPRA) and National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) said at least two million plastic bags a year were being distributed to shoppers in Nairobi alone, many of which were not disposed of properly.
More than 48 million thin plastic bagsng at a rate of 10 percent per year to feed massive consumer demand at home and in neighboring countries, the study said.
The Rwandan government has launched a national war against plastic bags as an attempt to maintain the environment and clean up the country, President Paul Kagame told reporters Monday.
Kagame who participated in the clean up of the Kigali city said that his government had endorsed the ban on all plastic bags and anyone who still owns them ought to face penalties.
"We want people to use traditional baskets and give the land a breathing space," Kagame said.
"We have a real problem with plastic and we are linking this with our efforts to protect our rivers and lakes," Mugorewera Drocella, minister of lands and environment told reporters.
However, shop owners feel the government's decision was to hostile and too heavy for them.
"We have now resorted to using newspapers as packing bags until the government shows us what to be used," one businessman in the capital city Kigali said.
In San Francisco, the free grocery bag soon might go the way of the full service gas station.
City officials are considering charging grocery stores 17 cents apiece for the bags, 90 percent of which are plastic and are blamed by environmentalists for everything from clogging recycling machines to killing marine life and suffocating infants.
Although the environmentalists are not as concerned about the effect of recyclable paper bags on the environment, the proposal would include them, too, with the idea of reducing waste in general.
In turn, the fee would be passed on to the consumer.
Proponents of the surcharge hope this will persuade shoppers to give up the convenience of the disposable sack.
"Yes, it's going to be a pain the ass, but that's part of the point," said Mark Murray, executive director of Californians Against Waste.
"One thing we've learned is that sending a financial signal to the marketplace tends to modify behavior much better than voluntary approaches."
Trade groups representing grocers and the plastics industry predictably aren't crazy about the idea.
"We think essentially it's an unnecessary and misguided approach," said Tim Shestek, spokesman for the American Plastics Council.
"This tax is going to hurt those who can least afford it."
The proposal, set to be considered by the Commission on the Environment on Tuesday, imitates efforts around the world to stem the use of plastic bags known in China as "white pollution."
Ireland, South Africa, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai and Taiwan are just a few of the places where the government either bans plastic bags outright or charges a fee to use them.
Trade groups contend that the results of those efforts are mixed.
In Ireland, for example, there is anecdotal evidence of increased shoplifting as people bring in their own bags and higher sales of boxes of plastic bags, which consumers use for everything from pet waste to trash cans.
Murray said the local effort is the first in California after an Assembly bill to levy a statewide 2 cents charge on nonrecyclable disposable bags failed last year.
"We've attempted to pursue this at a state level, but the lobbyists for the retail industry are too strong," he said.
After being considered by the commission, the proposal would move to the mayor's office or the Board of Supervisors in search of legislative sponsors.
A spokesman for Mayor Gavin Newsom said the mayor is reviewing it.
Meanwhile, the proposal has at least one potential champion on the Board of Supervisors, the newly elected Ross Mirkarimi, who helped found the city's Department of the Environment, which is overseen by the Commission on the Environment.
"We all have a responsibility to promote a healthy and sustainable environment, and by doing that, it means we need to help change people's patterns, and that even means their shopping patterns," said Mirkarimi, who will take office in January.
"This is a sensible user fee."
The proposal, which takes the form of a resolution urging the mayor and board to take action, also suggests expanding the surcharge in the future beyond grocers to include drug stores, dry cleaners, newspapers and other retailers.
According to the Department of the Environment, consumers lug home about 50 million bags from San Francisco grocery stores each year.
Of those, 90 percent are nonrecyclable plastic.
A report prepared in support of the proposal by Robert Haley, recycling program manager for the environment department, says plastic bags gum up recycling and composting machines at Norcal San Francisco's waste management provider resulting in $1 million in extra costs and lost revenue from the sale of recyclable materials.
The bags account for 2 percent of the city's total "waste stream," and picking up and disposing littered bags cost an additional $7.4 million annually, according to the report.
It notes that an estimated 12 million barrels of oil go into the production of plastic bags, while 14 million trees are felled to make their paper counterparts.
Paul Smith, vice president of the California Grocers Association, said the proposal is strongly opposed by the industry group.
"We're not sure where it came from or ,where the 17 cents is going to go.
There's not really a lot of accountability," Smith said.
According to the proposal, grocers would be able to keep half of the fee and would be expected to spend it on city approved programs, such as discounted reusable shopping bags.
Shestek, the American Plastics Council spokesman, said some of the costs attributed to plastic bags could be recouped by sending plastic bag waste to companies that can use it as a raw material, such as decking and composite lumber producers.
Heidi Melander, president of the Northern California Recycling Association, a supporter of the proposal, said the fee was a tangible way the public can participate in helping reduce waste.
"We've been trained to want bags," she said.
"It's gotten out of hand everywhere you go, they force them on you, and they think you're weird if you don't take a bag.
We might not have control over the blister packaging around the electronic equipment we buy.
But we have control over taking that bag."
City officials are considering charging grocery stores 17 cents each for grocery bags to discourage use of plastic sacks.
More than 90 percent of consumers choose plastic bags, which are blamed for everything from clogging recycling machines to killing marine life and suffocating infants.
But the fee would also apply to paper bags to help reduce overall waste.
Promoting a healthy environment "means we need to help change people's patterns, and that even means their shopping patterns," said incoming city Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi, who takes office in January.
"This is a sensible user fee."
The city's Commission on the Environment will consider the proposal Tuesday.
Mayor Gavin Newsom is reviewing the idea.
The city's Department of the Environment estimates San Francisco customers bring home about 50 million bags each year.
That accounts for about 2 percent of waste, at an annual cleanup cost of about $8.4 million (euro6.45 million).
Grocers and the plastics industry oppose the measure.
"We think essentially it's an unnecessary and misguided approach," said Tim Shestek, spokesman for the American Plastics Council.
"This tax is going to hurt those who can least afford it."
State legislators defeated a bill last year that would have charged 2 cents on each non recyclable disposable bag.
The San Francisco proposal parallels efforts in Ireland, South Africa, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai and Taiwan, which ban plastic bags or charge a fee to use them.
Parts of Eritrea once littered by a sea of flimsy shopping bags are being cleaned up thanks to a new law that entered into force in January to help the Horn of Africa country protect nature.
In the capital Asmara and other outlying regions, the bags have been replaced by the cotton and nylon and Eritreans have no choice but to adapt to instead.
Since January, "those who import, produce, distribute or sell plastic bags are fined," said Wolde Yohannes, the head of environment wing in the ministry of land, water and environment.
Wolde did not give the amount of the fine, but several sources estimated that offenders can pay several thousands of nakfa.
Since a dollar here is worth 15 nakfa, such fines are hefty in the country where, according to an International Monetary Fund report, annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is 130 dollars (100 euros).
Authorities here are indeed determined to stem the problem.
Individuals are not fined if they are caught with a plastic bag.
They simply have to tell the authorities where they got the bag from, explained Wolde.
"If we find that individuals don't cooperate, they could also be fined," said Kibrom Asmarom, an official in the environment department.
Kibrom expressed satisfaction on people's respect on the law, nevertheless.
Authorities had a raft of reasons for declaring war on the flimsy bags that not only block gutters and drains, choke farm animals and marine wildlife, pollute the soil, but also ruin dramatic natural vistas and can take 20 to 1000 years to decompose.
"The animals were eating the plastic bags and dying," Wolde said.
Loss of livestock can be depressing in this poor country that regulary suffers from bouts of drought.
"The bags used to clog the drainage pipes.
And they were thrown everywhere, got stuck in the trees, and spoiled the landscape," he added.
As animals were dying and drainage getting choked before the law came into force, some areas around Asmara used to be covered by a sea of coloured plastic bags.
Unwittingly, goats and sheep chewed them, the officials said.
Authorities had better plans for the outlawed papers.
"We don't burn them, factories which make plastic use them for other purposes," said Wolde.
"Only a few people have complained about this ban," he added.
With a threat of fine, Eritrean in the streets of Asmara have no choice but to abide by this environmentally friendly law.
Others have even forgotten that plastic bags did exist and littered their streets and trash dumbing zones, just before January.
"People have already forgotten about plastic bags, they've moved on to other things," quipped one Eritrean.
While Eritrea has kicked out plastics, a much needed backing from anti plastic campaign rang at UN Environment Programme governor's meeting in Kenya last week, with Nobel Peace Laureate Wangari Maathai leading a league to ban the flimsy types.
Discarded plastic bags "provide several million habitats for mosquitoes to breed that increase the risk of malaria," she said, noting that the disease was a leading cause of infant mortality in Kenya and throughout Africa.
While in Europe, Ireland introduced a similar bid to cut down the use of plastic bags in March 2002, then dubbed a "plastax".
By August that year, shoppers had already cut the use of plastic bags by 90 percent, the environment ministry announced.
Uganda will soon ban the manufacture and importation of plastic bags and impose a hefty levy on thicker ones, an environment official has said.
Dr Aryamanya Mugisha, head of Uganda National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), was quoted on Monday by local press as saying that the measure would get rid of the increasing environmental and health menace.
"We are banning polythene bags and it is a matter of time for them to become history," Mugisha said on Sunday in Nairobi, Kenya where he is heading a NEMA delegation.
He said that the NEMA had made recommendations to the cabinet to ban the plastic bags about five years ago.
Mugisha said a ban on plastic bags is among proposals aimed at reducing the use of polythene, adding that but the tax imposed on the plastic bags about two years ago has not helped in restricting their use because their price is still very low.
He said he expected the ban on plastic bags to be effected later this year.
Rwanda imposed a ban on the manufacture and importation of polythene bags last year, while the United Nations Environment Program is working with the Kenyan government to ban plastic bags there in a new waste management strategy.
Uganda is one of the few countries in the Great Lakes region where plastic bags are not regulated.
Sources blamed the delay in effecting the decision on ban the manufacture and importation of plastic bags on the lack of political will and protecting those who have invested heavily in plastic bags.
The architectural team designing the World Trade Center (WTC) memorial presented an update on its plans Thursday afternoon.
Governor George Pataki and Mayor Michael Bloomberg joined the team of architects to present a more detailed description of what visitors will experience at the memorial and the surrounding plaza.
The updated design will not include any changes to the random listing of the victims' names.
The families of some rescue workers wanted their loved ones listed separately, though police officers, firefighters and paramedics will be identifiable by the insignia of their respective agencies.
"We have to have a memorial that really allows us to connect the sheer enormity of the Twin Towers, to the individuals that were taken from us," said Bloomberg.
Pataki praised designers for creating a fitting memorial to those who lost their lives at the WTC site.
He said the memorial will help tell the story of Sept 11 and the lost lives, so that future generations will understand the enormity of what happened here.
The new schematic design features a vast landscaped civic plaza, cascading voids with deeply recessed pools and an area for those lost but never identified.
"The primary responsibility that we have is to those who lost so much on that terrible day," said memorial designer Michael Arad.
"We want to show, to make clear, what a great loss we all suffered. "
In January, 2004, a 13 member jury selected "Reflecting Absence " by Michael Arad and Peter Walker as the design for the WTC memorial.
Over the past months, the design team, with associate architect Max Bond, embarked on the schematic design process to develop the physical and programmatic elements of the memorial.
The memorial, which will commemorate the nearly 3000 victims of the Sept 11 terror attacks and the 1993 bombing, is expected to be completed by 2009.
Don't look now actually, you can't look now but a great deal of decision making about the public realm at the new World Trade Center may disappear from public view behind closed boardroom doors.
The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation board met Wednesday for the first time before emerging for an introduction to the site by the architects Daniel Libeskind and Michael Arad.
Because the board includes Robert De Niro and Barbara Walters, there were many cameras and microphones to capture that moment in the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center, overlooking ground zero.
Images and sound bites convey a false sense of accessibility, however.
The truth is that the two hour meeting was closed to the public and the news media, since the foundation is a private corporation.
Officials have long complimented themselves sometimes with good reason on the openness and transparency of planning efforts at the trade center site.
But the future may hold opacity, or at least translucence, as the nonprofit foundation assumes more of the role that the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. has performed until now.
The impact of this shift has not received much attention, perhaps because the very name "Foundation" understates the new body's role and potential clout.
On the face of it, it sounds like a genteel, cup in hand group that will solicit charitable contributions that the development corporation, a state agency, cannot.
Indeed, the foundation will be a fund raising organization.
"All levels of gifts from $1 to $100 million will be sought and accepted," said its September 2003 application for tax exempt status under section 501(c)3 of the internal revenue code.
(With about $3.5 million now in hand, $496.5 million is still to be raised.)
But the foundation was given a broader range of powers in its April 2003 certificate of incorporation, beginning with its purpose: "To own, construct, operate and maintain a memorial and related structures and appurtenances on the site of the World Trade Center."
Own.
Construct.
Operate.
Maintain.
That is a lot of responsibility, with many implications for the way the public will experience the memorial, the interpretive memorial center and the museums and the theaters, since the foundation is also charged with "encouraging the development of cultural facilities as part of the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site."
The foundation has a lot of power to do these jobs.
It may "solicit, accept, hold, invest, reinvest and administer any gifts, bequests, devises, benefits of trusts and property of any sort, without limitation as to amount or value, and to use, disburse or donate the principal or income."
(A devise is a gift of real property by will.)
It may also "purchase, lease, receive, own, sell and convey real and personal property of all kinds."
But it does not have to let the public listen in.
"There is no law that requires that the board must be open," said Ira M. Millstein, a senior partner in the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges, who is counsel to the development corporation board and one of the foundation's directors.
The board could choose to operate more openly.
"This is a decision for the board to make," Millstein said.
"It's very difficult to have a hair down discussion with everyone watching.
On the other hand, we want to be completely transparent."
Wednesday's session was largely procedural, according to those who were there.
Deputy Mayor Patricia E. Harris became the 33rd director and Jason R. Lilien was named counsel.
Walters, the one reporter in the room, raised the issue of openness.
John C. Whitehead, the interim chairman, told board members that meeting minutes would be made public.
The Lower Manhattan Development Corp. maintains a virtual library of important planning documents on its Web site, www.renewnyc.com, and opens its monthly board meetings to the public and the press.
True, almost all the substantive work goes on behind the scenes.
But several useful civic purposes are served.
For one, the principals almost always attend.
This means that citizens who show up to register their unhappiness with the corporation particularly for its failure to finance more job creation and lower income housing programs may be assured at least that their placards, banners and lapel buttons are being read by the people in charge.
One can argue whether these quiet protests have any meaningful effect but the board can never adjourn under the impression that its policies are uniformly popular.
Last month, for instance, members of the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York showed up to criticize the corporation for not helping finance a restaurant planned downtown to employ displaced workers from Windows on the World.
The matter was not even on the agenda but the workers had a chance to make their grievance felt.
Reporters are given about 10 minutes after each meeting to ask questions of anyone on the board, particularly those who would otherwise be hard to reach.
The principals typically stay for this question and answer session, even though they are sometimes put on the spot.
Meetings can be revealing.
Though they are tightly organized, with little freewheeling discussion, it is possible to see fissures within the board by paying attention to the questions, objections and exceptions that members register, even as they vote generally unanimously to adopt the items before them.
Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the development corporation and a foundation director, said, "The board clearly understands the public trust which they have undertaken and are committed to the same level of transparency as the LMDC."
All four living former US presidents have agreed to become honorary directors of the project for a permanent memorial to the victims of the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center.
New York Governor George Pataki said Monday that Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton had all pledged their support for the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation and would serve as honorary members of the board of directors.
"The memorial will be the centerpiece and our first priority in the rebuilding effort," Pataki said at a luncheon event in New York City.
"Reflecting Absence" by architect Michael Arad, which features two reflecting pools surrounded by gardens, was chosen from 5201 entries submitted to an international design competition.
The pools are to sit almost empty, with water running down the sides only, symbolizing the vacuum left by the 2749 people who died when two hijacked planes were crashed into the trade center's twin towers.
The memorial is scheduled to open in 2009.
Carter, Bush and Clinton were all together just last week, when they attended the dedication of Clinton's presidential library.
Ford, 91, had been unable to attend the event.
The World Trade Center memorial will preserve not only the memory of those who died on Sept 11, 2001, but the remnants visible and even tangible of the buildings that died that morning, too.
Severed during the clearing of ground zero, many steel and concrete column footings that still outline the perimeters of the twin towers will be made part of the memorial itself, as will a 70 foot tall, 250 foot long section of the original slurry wall.
On Thursday, almost a year after the world saw the earliest renderings of the plan called "Reflecting Absence," three architects guided their listeners the governor of New York and the mayor of New York City among them on a trip through the schematic design, showing in more detail the spaces that will compose the memorial when it opens in 2009.
Beginning on a plaza forested with some 300 oak trees and a one and a half acre open area that can double as a civic gathering place for as many as 10000 people, visitors will make their way down two switchback ramps, each as long as a city block, that will take them 30 feet below ground into the central memorial hall.
Here, both pool filled voids marking the absent towers will be visible through cascading curtains of water, each ringed with the names of the dead.
The pools will be centered within, but slightly smaller than, the tower outlines.
Forty feet below, within inches of bedrock itself, unidentified remains will be entombed.
On this level, the north tower's foundations will be exposed in a chamber more than 60 feet high.
Visitors will be able to touch the jagged steel and the rough concrete.
"I am looking forward to the day when I will be privileged to set foot and walk down those ramps to the bedrock and, like the family members, bend over and pay my tribute in an appropriate memorial," Gov. George E. Pataki said Thursday.
Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., which is overseeing the memorial, described the new elements as "simple acts, knitted together to create a powerful memorial at the heart of the World Trade Center site."
A fragment of granite bearing the name "John" all that remains of a memorial to the six people killed in the first terror attack on the World Trade Center was installed Saturday as the central piece of a new memorial.
In a ceremony above the gaping pit remaining from the Sept 11, 2001, attack that destroyed the complex and the original memorial, an honor guard of Port Authority officers placed the fragment in a 9 1/2 foot tall (2.9 meter high) steel pylon shaped like one of the twin towers.
The rose colored granite was part of a memorial fountain erected in 1995 to honor those killed on Feb 26, 1993, when 1200 pounds of explosives were detonated in a rented van in a parking garage under the towers.
"We have to remember that 9/11 began in 1993," said Michael Macko of New York City, son of victim William Macko.
"My father and these other five people were the first World Trade Center victims, and it's our duty to make sure they're not forgotten."
Nancy Burroughs, sister of victim Stephen Knapp, said "a lot of lessons could have been learned from that bombing that might have made a difference on 9/11."
The other victims were John Di Giovanni, the "John" on the surviving fragment, Robert Kirkpatrick, Wilfredo Mercado, and Monica Rodriguez Smith.
At a memorial Mass in nearby St. Peter's Church, the Rev. Kevin Madigan said in his sermon that the 2001 attack "in no way eclipses" the losses of 1993, but makes them "all the more real, all the more personal."
Gov. George Pataki said the world has "a sacred duty to remember" and Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the new memorial "will speak to generations of New Yorkers of our duty to remain relentlessly vigilant."
The task of raising half a billion dollars to build a World Trade Center memorial, a museum building and a performing arts center will fall to a foundation made up of captains of finance and real estate, cultural leaders, media heavyweights and seven relatives of those killed on 9/11.
After months of searching and one awkward false start last spring when two prospective co chairmen, Jerry I. Speyer and Sanford I. Weill, backed away from the job, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg were able Wednesday to name 31 members of the board of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation.
John C. Whitehead, the chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., will head the foundation until the board members have a chance to meet next month and select a chairman.
Until Wednesday afternoon, even the designated members did not know whom all their colleagues would be.
Heading the list of boldface names, in one arena or another, are Robert DeNiro, who has been a presence in the nearby TriBeCa area for many years, Barbara Walters of ABC, David Rockefeller, who was deeply involved in the original development of the World Trade Center, and Michael D. Eisner, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Co.
The roster seems to reflect some geopolitical ticket splitting, with the chairmen of giant downtown companies like American Express, American International Group and the Bank of New York balanced by Robert Wood Johnson IV, the owner of the New York Jets, who hopes to build a new football stadium on the far West Side.
"You probably won't find a board of any higher caliber anywhere in the city," said Bloomberg, who knows a thing or two about philanthropy.
"And that's really exactly what is called for because there isn't a more noble task before us."
The mission of the nonprofit foundation is to oversee and coordinate fund raising and construction of the memorial and the cultural buildings at the trade center site.
It will also own and operate the buildings.
Though the foundation will not formally begin raising money until next year, Bloomberg all but made the second big pledge as he stood at the lectern in the lobby of the American Express headquarters in the World Financial Center at Battery Park City.
"As the mayor of New York and also as a citizen of New York," he said, "I plan to do my part to ensure these projects reach their full potential."
The first big pledge may be said to have come last week, when Pataki declared in a speech that the highest priority for the remaining $816 million in unallocated federal grants controlled by the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. should be "to guarantee that we have the funds necessary to build the memorial."
Conceivably, then, the foundation may start its $500 million campaign with several hundred million dollars already available.
Pataki had already said that four former presidents Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford would be honorary members.
One of the working members will be Brian Mulroney, a former prime minister of Canada, whose presence symbolizes the international importance of the memorial, said Kevin M. Rampe, president of the development corporation and a foundation board member.
Speyer, the chairman and chief executive of Tishman Speyer Properties, whose portfolio includes Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building, agreed to serve on the board that he would not lead.
"I wanted to be helpful but, frankly, it was a matter of time," he said Wednesday.

Four US ex presidents, a Hollywood legend, a retired fireman and a star TV journalist were among those appointed Wednesday to lead the project for a memorial to the victims of the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center.
A total of 31 people were named to the board of directors of the memorial foundation, a non profit corporation that will construct, own, operate and maintain the memorial.
Along with a slew of prominent business leaders, the list included actor Robert De Niro, veteran TV correspondent Barbara Walters and Canadian former prime minster Brian Mulroney.
Former US presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton were all named honorary members.
"We can never forget the tragic events of September 11," New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement.
"That is why it is so important that when the new World Trade Center has been completed, we have a memorial that captures the depth of those attacks and preserves their full impact for future generations," he said.
"Reflecting Absence" by architect Michael Arad, which features two reflecting pools surrounded by gardens, was chosen from 5201 entries submitted to an international memorial design competition.
The pools are to sit almost empty, with water running down the sides only, symbolizing the vacuum left by the 2749 people who died when two hijacked planes were crashed into the trade center's twin towers.
The memorial is scheduled to open in 2009.
The memorial board also included retired New York firefighter Lee Ielpi and Monica Iken, whose husband was killed in the trade center attack.
"At the heart of the rebuilding is the creation of a lasting memorial which will honor the memories of those we lost and help tell their story to the world," said New York Governor George Pataki.
Having been eclipsed for most of this year by other issues at ground zero, the World Trade Center memorial returned to the forefront Monday as Gov. George E. Pataki offered a preview of the completed design, which he said will be ready next month.
In describing the memorial "Picture the old foundations of the Louvre in France or the catacombs at the Vatican" Pataki said the column remnants of the twin towers would be kept visible, "laying bare the very roots of the towers as visitors absorb the meaning of what took place here."
The governor said that financing of the memorial should be the "first and most important" priority for the $816 million in federal grants that have yet to be allocated by the Lower Manhattan Development Corp.
He also called for an overall spending plan by March, since demands downtown far exceed the available grants.
Pataki said former Presidents Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton would serve as honorary members of the memorial foundation, which will raise money for the memorial and the cultural centers.
The working members of the board are to be named next week by the governor and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
And Pataki announced that the underground memorial interpretive center, where artifacts and exhibits will tell the story of the trade center and the 2001 and 1993 attacks, will be designed by the Manhattan firm Davis Brody Bond, which is already associated with Michael Arad and Peter Walker on the memorial itself, the Norwegian firm Snohetta, which is working on the museum complex at the trade center site, and Howard Revis Design of Washington, which specializes in designing exhibits.
J. Max Bond Jr., a partner in Davis Brody Bond who accompanied Pataki at ground zero Monday, said, "Of course we're pleased, if somewhat apprehensive, since the stakes are so high and the projects are important and demanding."
In the governor's fourth progress report on Lower Manhattan, to 420 guests of the Association for a Better New York at the Ritz Carlton New York in Battery Park City, he was short on big news when will the damaged Fiterman Hall be razed?

where will an extra $3 billion come from to build a train tunnel from downtown to Long Island? but long on smaller yet vital details.
For instance, he outlined the early construction schedule of the Freedom Tower.
Excavation of 18000 cubic yards of bedrock for the column footings will begin in February, he said.
By April, steel and concrete will arrive.
A three foot thick concrete liner will be built to reinforce the slurry wall around the trade center foundations.
Later in 2005, he said, the floor slabs and tower columns of the skyscraper will start to rise.
Next month, Pataki said, construction is to begin on the new South Ferry subway station and on two stations that are part of the planned Fulton Street Transit Center on Broadway.
Also next month, he said, deconstruction will begin on the damaged, shrouded 40 story Deutsche Bank building across Liberty Street from the trade center site.
After his speech, Pataki visited the 21st floor of the Deutsche Bank building and then the muddy pit of ground zero, where outlines of the column remnants of 1 World Trade Center have been exposed.
Robert De Niro, Barbara Walters, David Rockefeller and other members of the foundation charged with raising money for a World Trade Center memorial held their first meeting.
The 33 member board set up governance and executive committees before meeting Wednesday with trade center master planner Daniel Libeskind and memorial architect Michael Arad near the building site.
Arad said his memorial will try "to make present what is absent" since the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attack that brought down the twin towers and other buildings.
The meeting came on the same day that Gov. George Pataki urged passage of an income tax checkoff that would allow New York taxpayers to donate to the memorial.
The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation's board also includes former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Disney CEO Michael Eisner and several trade center victims' family members.
They have been given the task of raising $500 million (euro378 million) to build both a memorial to the victims of the 2001 and 1993 trade center attacks and adjoining cultural facilities.
The memorial will include a forest of oak trees with a clearing for Sept 11 gatherings and a Memorial Hall between the reflecting pools that will mark the footprints of the lost towers.
Lower Manhattan Development Corp. Chairman John Whitehead last month called Memorial Hall a public space where visitors will be able to "review a directory of the names, locating their loved ones among the souls that are there."
Whitehead's agency was created to oversee redevelopment at and around the trade center site.
It is just a few feet high.
But it could profoundly affect a visitor's experience by creating the need for a wall running more than 200 feet along the Greenwich Street side of the memorial, marking an abrupt grade change between plaza level and sidewalk.
Between this wall and the museum complex at Fulton Street and a stairway at Liberty Street, there would be only two small areas where one could walk straight into the memorial from Greenwich Street, the approach most visitors will probably take.
To the public, the tough part of designing the memorial may seem to have passed last year with the choice of a concept, the twin voids of "Reflecting Absence," and the selection of architects: Michael Arad, Peter Walker & Partners and Davis Brody Bond.
But new challenges are unfolding, largely out of sight, as planners struggle to reconcile an architectural vision with the physical realities of a complex site.
At stake in these negotiations are elements as important as the whole east side of the memorial, which may depend on what may seem like arcane questions of roadway layout.
The bump really, more of a hump would occur in Greenwich Street at Dey Street.
Here, the surface would be 2 feet higher than at Fulton Street to the north and 6 feet higher than at Liberty Street to the south.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site and will build the streets, said that height would permit the installation of as many utility lines as are needed within the roadbed, directly above the subway tunnel for the Nos. 1 and 9 trains, with sufficient covering over the tunnel to satisfy Metropolitan Transportation Authority standards.
The slope would allow water drainage and prevent puddling in the street.
However, it would also mean that Greenwich Street would rise almost 5 feet higher than the memorial plaza.
There is not room enough to accommodate a stairway at this location because the footprint of the south tower an immovable element in the equation is too close to the sidewalk.
And the plaza cannot be canted upward to meet Greenwich Street because the voids will have walls of cascading water within, which must be kept absolutely level.
Any slope in the plaza would be apparent around the perimeter of the voids.
If Greenwich Street must rise that high, the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. has concluded that a wall will be needed along much of the adjacent part of the memorial.
Not only would that wall block physical access but it would also diminish the designers' goal of direct sight lines into the plaza from the surrounding sidewalks.
As an alternative, the corporation has proposed lowering Greenwich Street by four feet.
That would permit a level approach to the memorial at Dey Street.
(Because of the changing topography around the site, stairways will still be needed to reach the plaza level from the sidewalks at the southeast, southwest and northwest corners.)
"It's absolutely critical that we take the steps necessary to set the grade in a way that achieves the objective we all share of knitting the site back into the community, both physically and visually," Kevin M. Rampe, president of the development corporation, said Wednesday.
But the corporation's alternative raises more questions.
Where would utility lines go if they could not fit in a shallower Greenwich Street roadbed?
Why not raise the entire plaza level a bit?
And how appropriate is it for architecture to set street heights, rather than the other way around?
"The construction of Greenwich Street through the World Trade Center site is another of the complex engineering issues that must be carefully studied and resolved as we move forward with the redevelopment," said Kenneth J. Ringler Jr., the executive director of the Port Authority.
As engaging as last season's architectural beauty contests may have been, the real form of the future World Trade Center is being decided now.
God is in the details, Mies van der Rohe is often quoted as saying.
So is the devil.
HOW THE HEIGHTS ARE MEASURED How do you measure heights on a site with so many levels above and below ground?
Engineers typically rely on a datum, a constant plane from which elevations can be uniformly calculated.
Different data are used for different purposes.
The World Trade Center Downtown Restoration Program datum is closely related to that of the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad, now PATH, which was integral to the development of the twin towers in the 1960s.
Because the railroad datum was deliberately set very deep exactly 300 feet below mean sea level at Sandy Hook, N.J. all measurements from it can be expressed as positive elevations.
The trade center datum is 2.653 feet above the old railroad datum.
On this scale, the high point on Greenwich Street is at elevation 316 feet, the memorial plaza at 311.2 feet.
For comparison's sake, the PATH station concourse is at elevation 276 feet, the mezzanine at 264 feet and the passenger platforms at 250 feet.
The base of the trade center site is at elevation 243 feet.
The lowest point in the PATH system is midway in Tunnel E, the outbound route from the trade center to New Jersey, at elevation 212 feet.

In the ever fiercer fight over a year old plan to build a home for the Drawing Center and the International Freedom Center alongside the World Trade Center memorial, some relatives of 9/11 victims called on Monday for a fund raising boycott.
"We urge you to not donate to the World Trade Center memorial until the IFC and the Drawing Center are eliminated from the memorial plans," said "An Open Letter to the American People."
The letter appeared on a Web site, Take Back the Memorial, until questions arose over how many of the 14 relatives' groups that were signed to the letter had approved the use of their names.
Despite that withdrawal, critics of the cultural plan including two members of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation, which is charged with soliciting contributions said the freedom center had to be removed before they would support the use of public money for the overall project.
Opponents have objected in advance to what they say will be an anti American bias to the center's offerings, a charge that the center has just as strongly rejected.
"We owe it to the American people or anyone else who wants to donate to tell them what they're paying for and not mislead them," said Debra Burlingame, a foundation board member and one of the letter's authors.
She said financing for the memorial would be intermingled with that for the building at Fulton and Greenwich Streets that is intended to house the International Freedom Center and the Drawing Center.
The assertion was disputed by Lynn Rasic, the vice president for public affairs at the foundation.
"The first fund raising efforts are devoted to the memorial and the museum dedicated to Sept 11," she said.
"It's unfortunate and wrong to block efforts to make sure that our nation and the world remember those we lost during the attacks," Rasic said.
Asked whether it was a conflict of interest for board members to urge prospective donors to withhold support, Rasic said any potential conflicts would be reviewed by the governance committee.
Monica Iken, a board member and the founder of September's Mission, which supports the development of a memorial, said she had not approved the use of her group's name on the letter.
"I never signed off on anything like that," she said yesterday.
"I have an obligation to fund raise for the memorial," she added.
But Burlingame said her objections were in line with her fiduciary responsibilities as a board member.
"You can't go out to the public and say, 'We're raising $500 million,' and not tell them they're building on the same site a building so large it will dwarf the memorial," she said.
Lee Ielpi, another member of the foundation board, is also vice president of the September 11th Families Association, which was listed as supporting the open letter.
"I'm fully comfortable asking Americans who shared our sorrow and came to help us in the worst of times to help us honor our dead and the sacrifice they made," he said.
"I am not comfortable asking them to play a role in a political, economic or ideological passion play whose ending has yet to be written.
I believe the freedom center is a bad idea."
Robert D. Shurbet, the founder of Take Back the Memorial (takebackthememorial.org), said that the open letter was a draft that had been "posted prematurely" and that the link to it was removed "pending final approval" by the relatives' groups.
As to the larger issue of the cultural organizations, Stefan Pryor, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., said officials were having "continuing conversations with the two institutions regarding their response" to concerns raised by Gov. George E. Pataki.
On June 24, the governor asked for an "absolute guarantee" that programs on the site not denigrate America or offend victims' families.
Eric Foner, the DeWitt Clinton professor of history at Columbia University, resigned from the freedom center's committee of scholars and advisers early this month, after a letter from the center to Pryor that tried to address those concerns.
News of his resignation was reported on Saturday in The New York Post.
Gretchen Dykstra, the city consumer affairs commissioner, who previously led the redevelopment of Times Square, was named Thursday as president and chief executive of the foundation charged with raising more than $500 million for a memorial and two cultural buildings at ground zero.
The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation was created in December to raise money and run the memorial and the cultural buildings, which include a performing arts center and museum.
Its board, which includes David Rockefeller, Robert De Niro,Barbara Walters and Michael D. Eisner, is expected eventually to take over many of the responsibilities of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., which is overseeing the rebuilding effort at ground zero.
"It's important, it's historic, it's unique and it's doable," Dykstra, 57, said of her new job in an interview at the corporation's offices near ground zero.
She said she was confident that it would not be hard to drum up financial support "not for this event, not for this purpose."
"We've got to get moving," she said, adding that the foundation members had "already begun to lay the groundwork."
At a news conference at the trade center site after the foundation's second board meeting Thursday, John C. Whitehead, the chairman of the development corporation, said the foundation began its fund raising effort about two weeks ago and had already received large financial commitments.
He said that by large gifts he meant pledges of $10 million to $25 million.
Dykstra was selected from about 12 candidates, Whitehead said, because "she has all the qualities we were looking for in a president."
Dykstra said she would start in her new post next month.
She will face the challenge of balancing the competing concerns of the parties involved at ground zero, including city and state officials, families of those who died in the Sept 11 attacks, downtown residents, real estate developers and big name architects.
That may be what she had in mind Thursday when she said it was important "to make sure the process of getting there also makes us proud."
"There are a lot of players," she added, "a lot of pressures."
Plans call for the performing arts center to be shared by the Joyce Theater, which presents dance, and the Signature Theater Company, an off Broadway company.
The museum is to be shared by the Freedom Center, a nascent organization that plans to focus on human rights exhibitions, and the Drawing Center, which presents drawing shows in SoHo.
But prospects for all four groups remain murky given that the development corporation has yet to say how much it will contribute toward the groups' construction and operating costs and how much they will have to provide.
The corporation has delayed its announcement of a design of the performing arts center, by the architect Frank Gehry, citing complications related to fitting both the Joyce and the Signature into a single building with limited space.
Whitehead spoke of the performing arts center as part of a "second phase" with a separate fund raising goal of "roughly $200 million", the first $500 million will cover the memorial, a memorial center and the museum component, which includes the Freedom Center and Drawing Center.
The development corporation later said the $200 million figure was uncertain until a design was completed.
The corporation also has delayed releasing a design of the museum building by the Norwegian architecture firm Snohetta, citing details still to be resolved.
In addition, the design of the memorial itself has been complicated by the fact that three different architectural firms are involved.
Born on Staten Island and raised in Philadelphia, Dykstra received her bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin and a master's in education and an honorary doctorate from the Bank Street College of Education.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 29: Somewhere in the ill conceived campaign to "take back the memorial" at ground zero, false impressions have managed to triumph over facts.
This week, Debra Burlingame, a board member of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation, and others called for a boycott of fundraising for the memorial until the International Freedom Center and the Drawing Center have been banished from ground zero.
She argues that money for the memorial will be intermingled with funds for the cultural building that is supposed to house the Freedom Center and the Drawing Center.
This is both misleading and harmful to the memorial itself.
The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation has pledged that its first priority is to build the memorial and create an endowment for it.
Private donors are free to specify how they choose to have their money spent.
The attacks on the International Freedom Center and, more broadly, on the cultural component of Daniel Libeskind's master plan make it all too easy to forget the existence of a Memorial Museum that is devoted wholly to the events of 9/11.
Opponents of the Freedom Center, like Burlingame, claim that the Memorial Museum will be dwarfed by the cultural center.
In fact, they overstate the size of the Snohetta building, which is being scaled back for other reasons, and they have exaggerated the floor space allotted there for the International Freedom Center.
They also make it sound as if the Memorial Museum, which at 50000 square feet is larger than the public spaces in the Whitney Museum, is somehow an afterthought relegated to the basement.
It will be built underground, but that is because the 9/11 families asked to have access to the bedrock and to what remains of the foundation of the twin towers.
To argue over the size of these two spaces is to assume that emotional power is solely the result of square footage.
It is also to forget the profound effect that going to the roots of the World Trade Center will have on most visitors.
But this is not really a campaign about money or space.
It is a campaign about political purity about how people remember 9/11 and about how we choose to read its aftermath, including the Iraq war.
On their Web site, www.takebackthememorial.org, critics of the cultural plan at ground zero offer a resolution called Campaign America.
It says that ground zero must contain no facilities "that house controversial debate, dialogue, artistic impressions, or exhibits referring to extraneous historical events."
This, to us, sounds un American.
New York Governor George Pataki joined victims' family members, survivors, and rescue workers Thursday in laying out a timetable for two temporary Sept 11 memorials.
One project is an oral history booth called "StoryCorps."
Set up in the PATH station at the World Trade Center site, it will have audio recordings featuring memories of loved ones and the events of Sept 11.
The memorial will open to the public on July 12.
The permanent memorial, part of the trade center site redevelopment, is due to open in 2009.
Governor Pataki said it was important to have temporary memorials to help the victims' loved ones and help tourists understand what happened there.
"You come down here any time, any day and there are people looking down at the site and imagining in their minds what happened on Sept 11," said Pataki.
"Now they can still do that, but then they'll be able to go across the street to the tribute center and be told the actual story by people who understand it and by people who were there on that day."
The other project is the Tribute, set to open in March next year at a now vacant storefront and basement at Liberty Street.
The center will house a gallery, exhibits and education programs, and will offer walking tours around the trade center site.
The interim memorials will serve as outlets for information about the attacks until the permanent memorial is built.
The clock ran out last week for public comments on New York state's plan to condemn almost an entire block south of ground zero, the last parcel needed for the full redevelopment of the World Trade Center site.
Conspicuously absent from the comments submitted to the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. was any objection from the Milstein family, owners of the land the state proposes to take.
"We're hopeful that we will have a satisfactory resolution soon," said a spokesman for Paul and Howard P. Milstein, father and son, who run Milstein Properties and are co chairmen of the Emigrant Savings Bank.
The Milsteins' conciliatory statement, which is all they will say on the subject, sets the stage for negotiations one step ahead of formal condemnation over a vital parcel that is to serve as the gateway to the ramps, service roads, loading docks and parking spaces under the future trade center.
"We remain hopeful that we'll be able to reach a negotiated settlement," Kevin M. Rampe, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., said Wednesday.
Known on city maps as Block 56, this parallelogram shaped property is bounded by Liberty, Washington, Cedar and West Streets.
The Milsteins own all but the lot on which St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church stood until it was crushed by 2 World Trade Center.
But the Milsteins have been unable to use their land since Sept 11, 2001.
Today, Block 56 is controlled by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
It serves as a parking lot, staging area and roadway into the trade center site.
The Milsteins bought their 20000 square foot property in 1978.
In 1981, they announced plans for a 35 story, 400000 square foot office building, to be called 1 World Plaza, or 140 Liberty Street.
Designed by the Vilkas Group, it would have been connected at the second story level with a pedestrian bridge to 1 Bankers Trust Plaza, which was later known as the Deutsche Bank building.
There was no market for that project, but the Milsteins kept exploring possibilities.
They tried to acquire the St. Nicholas property, going so far as to discuss projects in which they would construct a new sanctuary for the Greek Orthodox Church in the base of a larger building.
More recently, they had focused on residential or hotel development.
Meanwhile, the site was used as a parking lot.
Control of the property was assumed by the City Department of Design and Construction after Sept 11, 2001.
The city then passed control to the Port Authority.
The authority has never entered into a lease or other agreement with the Milsteins, although there were some discussions in 2002.
The authority has not paid any money to the Milsteins for using this block.
(The church property will not be taken by eminent domain but swapped for a larger parcel nearby on which a new sanctuary and interdenominational center will be built.)
The planners of the trade center site originally envisioned that Block 56 would be part of the new Liberty Park, with St. Nicholas Church at its west end.
The ramp to the underground roadways was to be on the north side of Liberty Street.
Plans now call for the ramp to be on the south side.
That permits two way traffic on Liberty Street and separates what will be a heavily used ramp from the memorial.
But the trade center site is an interlocking puzzle.
No planning problem can be solved without creating another one.
To accommodate trucks and buses, the ramp entrance will need a great deal of headroom, so much that it will force the construction of a 20 foot earthen mound, or berm, in the middle of Liberty Park.
This berm could overwhelm the new church and loom over the south end of the memorial plaza.
On the other hand, if it were creatively conceived and designed, it might offer a fine vantage from which to view the memorial.
Before any of that happens, however, the Milsteins will almost certainly seek compensation for the three and a half years and counting in which they have been deprived of access to their property.
Just how much compensation remains to be seen.
They have already turned down a $30 million offer from the development corporation.
(Last week, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development approved the corporation's plan to spend $44.5 million to acquire the whole site, including the Milsteins' property.)
The Milsteins are also interested in a land swap.
It would not take much imagination to conclude that their sights are set on Battery Park City, which is controlled by a state authority.
They have already developed four apartment buildings there: Liberty Court, Liberty House, Liberty Terrace and Liberty View.
"All options are on the table," Rampe said.
Down at the Battery, booklets called "Attack on America," "Tragedy" and "Tragedia" sell for $6, or two for $10.
The pictures make the sale, and the pictures are all the same.
They tell a story exhaustively told in forests of newsprint, books, government reports, made for TV movies and a Bruce Springsteen record.
Inside the World Trade Center PATH train station, the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. has commissioned a project to tell the story again, an exercise in populism that takes an approach opposite to that of the photo booklets.
The project, a storytelling booth set to open Tuesday, depends on words with no pictures, rambling impressions instead of searing images, the cadence of voices in place of printed text.
In part, it is a stopgap for Reflecting Absence, a six acre memorial scheduled to open in 2009 at the site of the terror attack of 2001.
The storytelling idea has won tacit approval from survivors' groups, no mean feat in light of the controversies attached to memorial planning at the city's grimmest tourist attraction.
"People have stories to tell, they need to start doing it now," said Monica Iken, the founder of a group called September's Mission and a critic of some memorial plans.
"Children are getting older, people are ready to express themselves."
Iken lost her husband, Michael, a bond broker, at the World Trade Center.
The development corporation paid $350000 to build the booth and pledged an additional $150000 to operate it through December.
There are plans to install listening stations later on.
The project is an extension of work by Story Corps, which began an oral history archive at Grand Central Terminal two years ago.
In a sparse recording studio at Vanderbilt Hall and later in mobile booths traveling the country, 3000 people have conducted 40 minute interviews of friends and family members, keeping a copy and leaving another for submission to the Library of Congress.
The founder of Story Corps, David Isay, said many participants had been using their sessions to memorialize dead relatives, so the notion of a booth devoted to stories of Sept 11 seemed a natural fit.
"There's only one thing that's important about the site or September 11, and that's that people were lost," Isay said.
"Nothing else matters."
For the Sept 11 project, Isay invited survivors and relatives of victims to make the first recordings at Grand Central.
He expects others will go there, too, instead of to the World Trade Center.
So far, about 50 people have made Sept 11 recordings, but cancellations have been common, Isay said.
Michael Kuo, 29, whose father was killed on Sept 11, canceled an appointment in December.
"You can set an appointment for December 12, an arbitrary day, and you don't feel it, you don't feel sharp, you can't explain it," Kuo said.
For those who have made recordings, the experience has been emotionally complex.
Keith Meerholz, 39, who escaped from one of the towers, sat for an interview conducted by his wife, Grete, with help from a Story Corps worker.
"I never thought this would be a good thing for people to hear," Meerholz said.
"I always thought they would think, 'Why did that son of a bitch get out and not my person?"'
The speakers set their own paths.
The Leinung family's interview makes no mention of Sept 11 for the first quarter hour, the McNeal family brings it up almost at the start of the recording.
Because the booth will be open to everyone, not all of the recordings will be on the same emotional plane.
Edward Linenthal, a professor of history at Indiana University and the author of "The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City in American Memory," said that policy allowed Isay to avoid some tough choices.
In Oklahoma City, he recalled, memorial planners had to decide who had been in enough danger to be considered a survivor.
"It allows for a tremendously rich, complex collective memory," Linenthal said.
"It also attracts, not so positively, people who would seek to attach themselves to an important moment in history."
Mary Marshall Clark, director of the Oral History Research Center at Columbia University and a co coordinator of the unrelated Sept 11, 2001, Oral History Narrative and Memory Project, said the booth's value would depend in part on what solace it brings survivors.
On that score, she said, the location was not promising.
"Ground zero is by its very definition a place of destruction, of the end of life," Clark said.
"It's inviting them to re enter the void, so there should be someone there after the interview."
Isay said members of his staff call families after interviews.
The notion of speaking at the trade center site appeals to Kuo, who canceled his session last winter.
He has a new appointment for July 28, another arbitrary day when he might or might not feel like talking.
"I think it's right to do it at the World Trade Center site," Kuo said, "because that's where the spirits are."
Sometime it's hard to believe that Michael Arad is still in the picture.
Bit by bit, elements of his original design for the World Trade Center Memorial have been whittled away, whether because of logistical realities at ground zero (the memorial will be built above PATH train tracks), client demands (the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. is calling the shots), the many other interests involved (the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site, victims' families, downtown residents) or the assorted architectural cooks (three other firms).
For example, Arad included no trees in his original design, which was chosen in January 2004 after a competition.
The memorial jury expressed a desire to make his design more green, so he teamed up with the landscape architect Peter Walker.
Now Arad is fending off a veritable forest at the site and dealing with how the trees might impinge on the memorial below them.
Arad originally designed four ramps leading into and out of the memorial.
Now there are two.
His reflecting pools were not centered in the footprints of the twin towers.
Now they are.
Two considerably more experienced architectural firms are taking part in the process: Peter Walker & Partners and Davis Brody Bond.
Handel Architects is also involved, Arad, now 35, joined the firm last year to give himself institutional backup.
Some planning and design experts marvel that Arad has not been completely marginalized or discouraged.
"He may be crumbling internally, but I think he's shown surprising maturity for his tender years," said David J. Burney, the commissioner of the New York City Department of Design and Construction and an architect himself.
In a telephone interview yesterday, Arad was cautious in fielding questions about the current state of his design.
(Joanna Rose, the development corporation spokeswoman, was in the room on speakerphone.)
Asked whether he was satisfied with the two ramps, Arad did not respond.
His partner, Gary Edward Handel, piped up, "We're not happy about every decision that's made, but we trust the process."
Arad would say only that he was keeping his eye on the finish line.
"My role in this is to be the advocate for the memorial," he said.
"That is what I do every day in this project."
To be sure, the conflicts over the design of the memorial have not brought the architects to a standoff or the process to a standstill, as occurred when David Childs and Daniel Libeskind fought over the design of the Freedom Tower.
Indeed, even as the Freedom Tower has become a big question mark at ground zero in terms of what it will look like and when it will be finished, the memorial is proceeding apace.
Groundbreaking is expected early next year for an opening on Sept 11, 2009.
The party line is that people are working through their differences and that those differences will make for a better final product.
"There's a healthy dialogue and differing opinions," said Kevin M. Rampe, president of the development corporation.
"I think that's been great.
Each brings their unique experience."
Walker is largely concerned with "how the landscape interacts with the memorial," Rampe continued, adding that J. Max Bond Jr. of Davis Brody Bond "brings an enormous wealth of practical experience about engineering considerations, and Michael brings the vision."
Despite the varying levels of professional experience, Rampe said Arad had managed to hold his own.
"Michael has earned a level of respect," he said.
"I don't think one feels they can overwhelm the other.
They come with different perspectives, different skills, and ultimately they will end up with good results."
The architects largely echoed that assessment.
Bond said, "The design benefits from the interaction of the three different firms and the consultants."
Walker said, "Sometimes it's heated, sometimes it works very smoothly."
Arad said: "It's not about this being a harmonious process.
It's about it being a productive process."
But some of those involved say Arad was unprepared for the harsh realities of the process above all, how much his plan would have to change in light of engineering concerns and competing priorities.
"We viewed the competition as the beginning of the evolution," said Douglas Findlay, a partner in the Walker firm.
"He often views it as the end."
Walker offered, "I'm glad I didn't deal with something of this magnitude at the beginning of my career."
He added, "This is the process to end all processes."
Arad said he was by no means naive about the logistics involved, in addition to the PATH tracks, a chiller plant lies under the site.
"The technical complexity of the site is challenging," he said.
"But our team has a thorough grasp of the issues."
At the same time, Arad said, his vision for the site remains clear.
"I know exactly what I want to see here, and it's just a matter of advocating for the memorial," he said.
"I think people understand that and appreciate it."
When he won the design competition, Arad was only 34 and had never done anything nearly so big before, let alone at one of the most scrutinized architectural sites in the city's history.
After earning his master's degree from Georgia Tech's College of Architecture in 1999, Arad spent three years at Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, where he worked on projects like Espirito Santo Plaza in Miami and Union Station in Hong Kong.
Then he joined the New York City Housing Authority, where he was working on two new police stations when his memorial design was selected.
Before becoming an architect, Arad spent three years in the Israeli Army.
And he is no stranger to politics or diplomacy: his father, Moshe, served as Israeli ambassador to the United States from 1987 to 1990 and as the ambassador to Mexico from 1983 to 1987.
The memorial is expected to cost $350 million, including the Memorial Center, a separate area being designed by Davis Brody Bond that is to include artifacts from the Trade Center.
The architects are still in the thick of resolving each of the design details that will make up the memorial, from how much noise and splash the waterfalls will give off to how people will find the names of their loved ones inscribed in stone around the two pools.
Most recently, for example, the parties involved have clashed over the number of ramps, the decision to have two instead of four was clearly made over Arad's objections.
According to Findlay, the best architects are the ones who "are able to deal with these obstacles and turn them around to make them into something, make them a virtue not to resist it," and to keep their eyes open "for the great ideas that flow by."
That is not to say that an architect should say yes to everything if he believes it compromises his design, Findlay said.
He cited his own objections to the Port Authority's proposal to place a huge vent in the middle of the park.
Arad's initial design did not address questions like crowd circulation or security.
An information center called Memorial Hall has been added between the two pools.
Walker said the experience had deepened his respect for Maya Lin, who designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington.
"I've never had the appreciation for her that I have now," he said.
"How she got through it and got something that is really good and still has got her head about her I think about it all the time."
But Findlay emphasized that the ground zero memorial raises different challenges.
"This site is where the event occurred," he said, adding, "The memorial is essentially people's grave site."
With this in mind, the architects are working on the spiritual aspect of moving through the memorial going from the bustle of the secular city into the park into the sobering memorial and up again into the living world.
"Imagine walking around a five acre oak woodland," Findlay said.
"You will be drawn into it.
You can see across the plain and see the plain go away.
You can hear the waterfalls, and at night it glows.
So in all ways the voids have been made very important."
Nonetheless, some of the Sept 11 families are unhappy with how the memorial is shaping up.
Some want the names of the victims listed alphabetically, or by tower, or by police or fire department affiliation.
Some even want the remains of the World Trade Center victims to be moved to the site from the Fresh Kills landfill.
"You can't call these people heroes and leave their remains in a garbage dump in Staten Island," said Edie Lutnick, executive director of the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund, set up to aid families of victims who worked for the financial services concern at the World Trade Center.
As for creative tensions, some architects say they are to be expected.
"You put capable and strong willed design firms in a room and there is a discussion of options," said Fredric M. Bell, executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects.
"That's how it should be."
"I think Michael is a very reasonable and smart and flexible person not the type to say, 'I'm taking my marbles and going home,"' he said.
At the same time, Bell added: "He does have strong ideas.
Winning a competition is incredibly empowering.
That's the card that Michael has."
Uncertainty is looming large at Ground Zero as plans to heal the scars of Sept 11, 2001 face new setbacks and revisions.
The Freedom Tower meant to rise from the World Trade Center's ashes will be redesigned because of security concerns, officials said this week.
Plans for a memorial for the terror victims also will likely undergo many changes.
This comes amid slowed construction, the resignation of a leading development official, bickering over design and continuing questions about whether so much new office space can be filled in lower Manhattan.
Some groups representing victims' families, who faced a Friday deadline to submit public comments on proposed memorial changes, blame government officials and developers for rushing the rebuilding.
"The memorial has taken a back seat to the commercial interests," said Anthony Gardner, a board member of the Coalition of 9/11 Families whose brother, Harvey, was killed in the attacks.
The coalition opposes many proposed changes, including reducing the number of pedestrian ramps into the memorial from four to two.
"They're going to be recreating that claustrophobic sort of environment that was going on during the attack as people were descending the stairwells," Gardner said.
Changes to the Freedom Tower could be even more extensive.
The skyscraper was envisioned as a twisting 1776 foot spire of glittering glass and steel, its form evoking the Statue of Liberty's silhouette.
But the building is going back to the drawing board, Gov. George Pataki said Wednesday, responding to security concerns from the New York Police Department.
One of the worries expressed last month was that the building would be too close to the street and vulnerable to a truck bomb attack.
"I have no doubt that (architect) David Childs will come up with yet another magnificent design that will once again inspire the nation and serve as a fitting tribute to freedom," Pataki said.
A first look at that new design, which should still reach the same patriotic height, could be released in several weeks, development officials said.
The security concerns will likely push back the tower's completion date to at least 2010, a year later than first planned.
The emergence of these security issues so recently the tower's design was unveiled in December 2003 and the cornerstone laid on the last Fourth of July has led to finger pointing by government officials, with some expressing surprise over the police concerns.
Sen Charles Schumer, D N.Y., while praising Pataki for acting to get the project back on track, had said a day earlier that the rebuilding was "losing steam."
"A culture of inertia has infected downtown redevelopment and our city in general, making large public projects like this one nearly impossible to complete," he said.
"We seem to be losing our way."
Last month, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. suspended plans to build a $2 billion, 40 story headquarters at the site.
The state scrapped plans for a nearby traffic tunnel that concerned the company, but the building's future remains in limbo.
The planned Freedom Tower and the nearby 7 World Trade Center, which is almost complete, lack major tenants.
Adding to this, Kevin Rampe, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., which oversees the rebuilding effort at the World Trade Center site, announced on Monday his resignation effective later this month.
Rampe has said his departure was long planned and unrelated to the current redevelopment issues.
Schumer warned that continuing delays could put federal funding for the area at risk.
He added that while security concerns need to be taken seriously, "the Freedom Tower cannot become a barricaded, windowless fortress a dark and uninviting presence in a neighborhood that desperately needs the shops, people and bustle unique to this great city."
"The Freedom Tower is more than a building to anchor lower Manhattan," he said.
"It is a statement of American resolve."
Gov. George E. Pataki will appoint his chief of staff to take control of the rebuilding effort in Lower Manhattan, aides to the governor said last night.
He will also use hundreds of millions of public dollars to jumpstart the fund raising effort for the Sept 11 memorial at the World Trade Center site, they said, and will push ahead the timetable for producing a redesign of the Freedom Tower office building.
Pataki, in a speech Thursday to the Association for a Better New York, is to announce that John P. Cahill, one of his closest aides, is set to leave Albany to spend the majority of his time working on the complex multibillion dollar redevelopment project, and that he will be charged with the power to bring together the disparate agencies and agendas at the site, the aides said.
They spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve relationships with interested parties who had not yet been briefed about the changes.
Among Cahill's first priorities will be to lure Goldman Sachs & Co. back to Lower Manhattan.
The investment bank recently scrapped plans to build a new $2 billion headquarters across the street from the former World Trade Center site.
Pataki, the aides said, will also energize the fund raising effort for the planned memorial by earmarking $300 million in federal money for construction and maintenance of the complex, which includes a study center, underground exhibits and twin reflecting pools marking the footprints of the twin towers.
Finally, Pataki will announce that a new plan for the Freedom Tower, which was deemed vulnerable to a terrorist attack, will be released in one month.
Pataki's latest plans amount to his starkest and most public acknowledgement that the large and emotionally delicate effort in Lower Manhattan has suffered serious setbacks in recent weeks.
The governor is eager not only to mollify the executives at Goldman Sachs but also to quiet a growing chorus of critics from U.S. Sen Charles E. Schumer, D N.Y., to business leaders and real estate experts who have complained that the project seems derailed.
Pataki has long hoped that a rebuilt and prospering downtown would be the cornerstone of his legacy.
His third term expires next year, and he has not announced whether he will seek a fourth.
"The purpose of the speech is more than an update," one aide to the governor said.
"The purpose is to restore confidence in the rebuilding process."
The aide added that the lesson that was learned in recent weeks "is that anything can hit a snag, and we don't want things out of control again."
To that end, Pataki has assigned Cahill to coordinate the work of each government agency and private institution and to serve as the final word from Albany.
Cahill, a lawyer who early in his career handled some real estate and development projects, once served as the head of the State Department of Environmental Conservation and has long been one of the governor's senior policy advisers.
All those involved at ground zero will report to Cahill, including the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the agency set up in the aftermath of Sept 11 to run the redevelopment.
Kevin Rampe recently announced that he would resign as president of the development agency, and his successor has not yet been named.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Battery Park City Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will also report to Cahill.
He will also be the governor's liaison to the city and to private business.
A spokesman for Goldman Sachs expressed pleasure.
"We have had an excellent relationship with John Cahill," the spokesman, Peter Rose, said.
"We think he is the right person to provide leadership to bring the variegated parts of downtown together."
Pataki's speech will likely be greeted with some relief as well as skepticism, given that some three and a half years have passed since the trade center attacks.
"Timetables and speeches haven't gotten us anywhere so far," said Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who was briefed on the plan Wednesday night.
The families of the Sept 11 victims were one of Pataki's key constituencies as the new plan for the site was developed, and the governor is to make a gesture to that group as he pledges public dollars to build and preserve the memorial.
The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation was created in December to raise money and run and preserve the memorial and the nearby cultural buildings.
But the foundation, which garnered some private contributions, has also fallen short of the initial expectation of its founders.
It only recently named a president and began fund raising in earnest, and is far short of the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to proceed.
Pataki will announce that $300 million of the remaining $800 million in Lower Manhattan Development Corporation funds would go toward the memorial, with $200 million serving as a challenge grant for private donations.
As the focus at ground zero has suddenly veered to the Freedom Tower and the rough and tumble blame game involving its security redesign, the most vocal members of a powerful constituency the Sept 11, 2001, families have seized the hour to be heard above the growing clamor of politicians, developers, architects, cultural administrators, community advocates and other Lower Manhattan stakeholders.
Family members of the 2749 World Trade Center victims, and other interested parties, have until 5 p.m. Friday to formally express their concerns about the memorial's evolving design.
That witching hour officially halts the period of public commentary on a new round of amendments to the reconstruction effort's originally approved environmental assessment.
September's Mission and several other family groups have objected to many of the announced amendments, among them reducing the number of pedestrian ramps into the memorial to two from four.
They say that this would re create the claustrophobic experience of fleeing from the Twin Towers, and that it would pose a hazard if the projected 2000 visitors per hour had to exit in an emergency.
At least eight of the dozens of Trade Center groups have blitzed hundreds of families with e mail messages encouraging them to "Make Sure That the Families' Voices Are Heard," as one of the entreaties put it.
"We feel it's now or never," said the executive director of the World Trade Center United Family Group, Anthony Gardner, whose brother, Harvey Joseph Gardner III, died in the north tower.
"People are putting egos aside, and we've come together again, because we feel the memorial concerns are being ignored.
Originally the memorial was the heart of the site, and now it's getting less and less important."
The founder of September's Mission, Monica Iken, whose husband, Michael, died in the south tower, said that "everyone is talking about the Freedom Tower, but the memorial is all that many of us will have of our loved ones, and it has to be done right."
Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is overseeing the project and the public comment process, said of the changes that "the reason the number of ramps was reduced from four to two was that our consultants told us that was the best way to provide security there."
Beyond that, he said, the importance of the Trade Center memorial has been undiminished.
And, he added, some of the family critics were using the environmental comment period "as an opportunity to rehash issues that have been out there since the beginning."
Some of the family groups insist on direct access to the Trade Center bedrock at the tower footprints, considering it sacred ground that offers the only connection to their loved ones, since the remains of 42 percent of the victims including those of Iken's and Gardner's relatives have not been identified.
Current plans appear to require family members to traverse the spaces occupied by tourists and by graphic exhibits about the attack.
"We have plans that will allow people to have access to bedrock and the columns separately," said Michael Arad, the architect who designed the memorial.
"We have met with the families every step of the way," he said, "and we will continue to."
Other design criticism from family groups centers around the streetwalls or heights of buildings facing the streets which, according to the proposed site changes, could be as high as 150 feet, a prospect that could be "forbidding and unwelcoming" to pedestrians, Iken said, "and could detract from the memorial, shadowing it."
To Rampe, though, "the streetwall height is exactly the same as across the street at the World Financial Center."
"This was an aesthetic decision," he added, "to make it correspond with surrounding architecture."
Arad said, "We are trying to give the memorial quadrant a strong definition, so it can be a counterpoint to the development around it."
Important elements of the memorial design are now under intensive study in Richmond Hill, Ontario, just north of Toronto.
There, a consultant to the memorial design team has constructed a full scale mockup of one corner of one of the voids.
Water troughs at the upper level empty into a pool below, in a test of one of the most critical elements of the memorial: the walls of water that will cascade down all four sides of each enormous void.
Architects are experimenting with ways to reduce noise, splashing, freezing, blowing and clogging.
The public commentary process that ends Friday is made mandatory not only by New York State environmental law, but also by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which has awarded $2.78 billion in grants to the Development Corporation for the rebuilding effort.
The Development Corporation has the authority to choose among the comments it receives some 400 arrived by Thursday and the power to enact the changes it sees fit.
The public comment process "is not a meaningless exercise," Rampe said, pointing out that the original plan was altered in many respects, including the access to bedrock and the preservation of Trade Center remnants at the towers' footprints.
The family members are highly diverse, and some said that none of the disparate and sometimes fractious Sept 11 groups could speak for all the families in regard to progress at ground zero.
"We never thought it would be smooth sailing, and I think that a lot has been accomplished on the site," said Paula Berry, a member of the Families Advisory Council.
"On the whole, the LMDC has done an incredible job, and they have made great effort to be transparent."
But Frederic M. Bell, executive director of the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, echoed charges of some of the family activists in saying that the development corporation "has not put out enough public information for the public to weigh in."
"The LMDC garnered input early on," he added, "but that has diminished, and there is not enough public discourse on how the project has evolved."
His organization has filed an entry in the public comment process.
Rampe has rejected any extension of the public comment period, as some family groups requested.
But to Bell, "The comment period ends when people stop commenting.
So the comment period never ends."
In keeping with that reality, some family members are also taking issue with long known aspects of the project plan, including the prominence of the cultural buildings that, they say, encroach on the memorial.
"We've ended up with a memorial that's underground, with a museum that's hovering over the site," said Mary Fetchet, the founding director of Voices of Sept 11, who lost her son, Bradley, in the south tower.
Families are also concerned that visitors will be confused by the International Freedom Center.
"You're going to think that's the 9/11 museum," said Edie Lutnick, executive director of the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund.
Because the program planned for the center will not be purely commemorative, some say it does not belong there.
She and others suggest moving the cultural institutions into the bases of the commercial buildings on the site.
"You've got 10 million square feet of unrented office space," Lutnick said.
"Put it there."
The development corporation has said this is not under consideration.
Fetchet said she would urge Gov. George E. Pataki to "take a leadership role and scrutinize what's being done to the memorial."
"If the memorial fails," she added, "the governor fails."
Betty Friedan, a founder of the modern feminist movement in the United States, died here Saturday of congestive heart failure, feminist leaders announced.
She was 85.
Friedan achieved prominence in l963 with the publication of her book "The Feminine Mystique," which detailed the lives of American women who were expected to find fulfillment through the achievements of their husbands and children.
The book sparked a movement for a re evaluation of women's role in American society and is credited with laying the foundation of modern feminism.
She was a founder of the National Organization for Women and a leading advocate of the Equal Rights Amendment, a proposed amendment to the US constitution banning sex based discrimination, women's rights activists said.
"The movement that Friedan's energy sparked continues to grow, and is bigger today than she could ever have dreamed when she helped launch it in the 1960s," Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation and a former president of the National Organization for Women, said in a statement.
She said many of the advances for women and girls that Americans celebrate and enjoy today "would not have been possible without her determination and pioneering spirit to challenge the inequities when others dared not speak."
Betty Friedan, the writer, thinker and activist who almost single handedly revived feminism with her 1963 book "The Feminine Mystique," died of congestive heart failure Saturday, her 85th birthday, at her home in Washington.
Her insights into what she described as the soul draining frustrations felt by educated, stay at home women in the 1950s, "the problem that has no name," startled a society that expected women to be happy with marriage and children.
Her book became an instant and controversial bestseller, and Friedan became the leading spokeswoman for a revitalized women's movement.
One of the most recognized names and faces of the late 20th century, Friedan pushed for equal pay, sex neutral help wanted ads, maternity leave, child care centers for working parents, legal abortion and many other topics considered radical in the 1960s and 1970s.
Impatient that the federal government, in implementing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, did not appear to be taking equal pay for women seriously enough, she helped found in 1966 the National Organization for Women, the largest and most effective organization in the women's movement, and served as its first president.
She led the 500000 person Women's Strike for Equality in New York in 1970, on the 50th anniversary of women winning the right to vote.
She was a founder of the National Women's Political Caucus in the 1970s and of the abortion rights organization now known as NARAL Pro Choice America.
She was an organizer and director of the First Women's Bank and Trust.
"Many of us think of her as one of the mothers of the modern women's movement," said Kim Gandy, NOW president.
"She played a very pivotal, very critical role in launching the second wave of the modern women's movement."
"She was a giant in the 20th century for women and most significantly was a catalyst for change in the American culture," said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation.
"She defined the problem, and then she had the courage to do something about it."
Friedan's was a voice that was loud, insistent and sometimes divisive.
She split with NOW in the 1970s after she came to believe that the organization focused too many resources on lesbian issues and that too many feminists hated men.
Her 1981 book "The Second Stage" prompted some feminists to denounce her as reactionary.
Her 2000 memoir, "Life So Far," said that her husband, Carl, beat her during their marriage.
He strenuously objected, and Friedan amended the declaration to say that both of them fought physically during their marriage, which ended in divorce in 1969.
He died this December.
She turned to other issues, focusing on ageism, family issues and economic empowerment.
"It isn't that I have stopped being a feminist, but women as a special separate interest group are not my concern anymore," she said in 1993.
Friedan's cousin, Emily Bazelon, said: "Her feminism was an aspect of her humanism, and she really cared about the economic well being of families and of all people," Bazelon said Saturday.
Bettye Goldstein was born Feb 4, 1921, in Peoria, Ill., the Jewish daughter of an immigrant jeweler and a mother who quit her job as an editor of the local newspaper's women's pages to become a homemaker.
She later said she felt like an outsider from childhood.
She skipped second grade and was a high school valedictorian, then moved 1000 miles east to attend Smith College.
She edited the college newspaper and graduated summa cum laude in 1942.
She did graduate work at the University of California at Berkeley but turned down a prestigious fellowship in psychology, afraid of outperforming her then boyfriend.
After the romance broke up, she gave up graduate work and moved to New York's Greenwich Village to work for a labor newspaper.
She married and had a child, but when she became pregnant with a second child, she was fired.
Struggling as a freelance writer, she found that the editors of women's magazines deleted references to her subjects' interests outside the home, telling Friedan that the readers did not want to explore those topics.
She was grinding away on a survey of her Smith College classmates upon their 15 year reunion, when she added a few questions and said she discovered that the highly educated and talented housewives in their mid 30s were dissatisfied and distraught, drugged by tranquilizers, misled by psychoanalysis and ignored by society.
No magazine would publish her article.
Five years later, after significantly more work, she published "The Feminine Mystique" as a book and "pulled the trigger on history," as futurist Alvin Toffler said.
She pitched it on "The Jack Paar Show," she did question and answer interviews in magazines and she took every opportunity to alert the world to the crisis she perceived.
The book eventually sold more than 2 million copies in paperback and remains a staple of college history courses.
Daniel Horowitz, a Smith College professor who wrote "Betty Friedan and the Making of the Feminist Mystique," said that although Friedan presented herself at the time as a housewife who had an "aha!" moment, her ideas were partly rooted in the humanistic psychology that she studied at Smith.
She shared a Feb 4 birthday with Rosa Parks, and both Friedan and Coretta Scott King were at the convention of the Progressive Party in Philadelphia in 1948, he said.
"All three of them have their political roots in the struggles for social justice, for African Americans, for women and for working people in the 1940s.
Friedan was deeply embedded in and engaged with issues raised on the left in the labor union movement," Horowitz said Saturday.
"In 1943, she wrote, 'Men, there's a revolution brewing in the American kitchen.'
" During the next several decades, the highly recognizable Friedan was often seen in demonstrations, protest marches and news conferences.
She suffered insults, not just for her ideas, but for her appearance, which she readily admitted was "not pretty."
"That great head, the hooded eyes, the broad features of a woman the French might describe as une jolie laide@, which refers to a magnificent kind of ugliness that can be attractive, even beautiful," wrote Washington Post reporter Megan Rosenfeld in 1995.
"The head, looking sometimes like a snapping turtle and at others like a lion with a white mane, sits atop a surprisingly short body, out of which comes the voice of a foghorn in heat.
She is always carefully dressed in a New Yorky, nouveau Bohemian style, with lots of interesting jewelry and spunky little shoes.
(She loves to shop, say her friends.)"
Never an organization person, she alienated many who worked with her by insisting on holding the floor, claiming credit and running roughshod over her assistants.
She insisted that the women's movement remain in the mainstream of American life, objecting to the "bra burning, anti man, politics of orgasm school."
Younger leaders took over NOW, and after the publication of "The Second Stage," authors as different as Susan Brownmiller and Susan Faludi accused her of reversing the revolution.
Friedan declared herself past feminism and went to work on ageism, publishing "The Fountain of Age" in 1993.
But she never entirely left the feminist field, showing up at the 1977 National Women's Conference in Houston to second a resolution on lesbian rights, teaching at numerous colleges, including the University of Southern California, and serving on the White House Conference on the Family.
She lived in New York City and Washington and had a summer home in Sag Harbor, N.Y. Bazelon said services will be held Monday at Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York.
Survivors include three children, Daniel Friedan of Princeton, N.J., Jonathan Friedan of Philadelphia and Emily Friedan of Buffalo, N.Y., a brother and sister, and nine grandchildren.
"She's leaving a legacy that's living beyond even her wildest dreams in the '60s," Smeal said.
"She wanted to change the world, and she did."
The Feminine Mystique" jump started the women's movement more than 40 years ago with its expos on the discontent among American women over the tyranny of domesticity.
These days, many Gen X and Gen Y mothers are experiencing that same discontent.
"You become so absorbed in 'attachment parenting,' you put so much effort into it that you're lucky to get a shower," says Anne Marie Nichols, 40, of Firestone, who writes the newsletter for the national organization MOTHERS (Mothers Ought to Have Equal Rights.)
A former marketing copywriter, she's now full time mom to two toddlers and president of the board of directors of a charter school.
She believes that her generation, unlike the one that came of age in the 1960s and '70s, has failed to create social change for women through political action.
"After a certain point you think, 'Who cares how people voted?'
Your husband is yelling at you, there's no clean underwear, you didn't get to the store, and there are piles of laundry all over."
But in the past few years, a handful of organizations have begun to forge what's called "The 21st Century Mothers Movement."
Forget getting husbands to do more housework.
They want sweeping social change, a pro mother political agenda that would eliminate policies and practices that unfairly affect women as caregivers.
They advocate for affordable day care, tax breaks for corporations that allow mothers to work part time, and laws that provide health care benefits.
"Motherhood remains the crucial unfinished business of the women's movement," says Susan Douglas, author of "The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined Women."
But there's significant disagreement over the need for changing the system to help mothers.
"We emphasize the importance of motherhood," says Janice Crouse, senior fellow of the think tank Concerned Women of America in Washington, D.C., which works to bring biblical principles into public policy.
She agrees that motherhood is extremely stressful, with a litany of demands ranging from high pressured kids' activities to impossible standards of perfection.
"But it seems to me that, once again, they are looking for a governmental solution for someone else to solve their problems," says Crouse.
As a mother of grown children, she says, "There were days that I wondered if I would survive.
I very definitely identify with what they call 'mommy madness.'
But there's a sense of unrealistic expectations.
"We can't as women speak out both sides of our mouth.
On one hand, ask to be taken seriously and considered rational, intellectual beings.
And on the other hand, say 'Oh my goodness, I can't cope, this is too hard, someone's got to help me.'
"I feel like saying, 'You're a grown woman.
Take control of your schedule.'
If you can't manage that, you can't manage a company or a very demanding career."
In her new book "Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety," Judith Warner also criticizes the emerging mother's movement.
Her complaint is that it's unfocused and ineffective.
But pioneers of the movement refuse to quit.
They target what they consider inflexible workplace practices and outdated policies, which they believe increase the odds that mothers will experience financial insecurity and diminished well being over a lifetime.
"A 'perfect storm' of unfavorable economic and social conditions harms all women who mother, but the consequences are most severe for low income mothers, single parent mothers and mothers of color," said Judith Stadtman Tucker, at a recent conference on motherhood in Toronto.
To reach the tipping point will require an "open discourse about the new future of motherhood," said Tucker, who is editor and founder of The Mothers Movement Online.
Evidence of this dialogue percolating in pop culture includes blogger moms, mama zines, Web sites, e newsletters, and a deluge of trendy "momoirs" memoirs written by mothers.
This Mother's Day, activist campaigns will range from the "Mamas Rising Up!
Festival" in Brooklyn, N.Y., to blogger moms railing on the Web site of the national advocacy organization Mothers & More.
"Cultural politics is often a necessary prelude to political politics," says Douglas.
"We are in a consciousness raising mode right now."
In February, Newsweek ran a cover story on the myth of the perfect mother, based on Warner's book.
She described a "nationwide epidemic" of "craziness" in which 70 percent of American moms find motherhood "incredibly stressful."
This brings to mind, she wrote, "Betty Friedan's 1963 classic, 'The Feminine Mystique.'
The diffuse dissatisfaction.
The angst, hidden behind all the obsession with trivia, and the push to be perfect ,And the tendency, every bit as pronounced among my peers as it had been for the women Friedan interviewed to blame themselves for their problems."
The story triggered more than 600 letters from grateful readers.
"This generation of women isn't like (that of) the '60s, which protested and tried to change things," says Laura Nevitt, president of the Denver chapter of Mothers & More.
"I read that piece and thought, 'This is so me!'
I look at myself, and focus on what I am not doing instead of trying to get other people to help me.
I'm trying to be so self sufficient."
Modern mothers aren't just isolated, Warner argued.
They also are bred to rely on their own initiative, and to privatize their problems.
A few months earlier, an episode of "Desperate Housewives" targeted the problem.
Lynette, the stay at home mother of four hellacious children, has a meltdown and runs away.
After two friends track her down, she explains that she feels like a failed mother.
They confide they feel the same way but just don't admit it.
In communities across America, "mothers were talking about that episode," says Douglas.
"It was like a shock wave, because it was one of the most honest moments on TV about motherhood.
It hit a nerve, making fun of the myth of the perfect mother and the myth of domestic bliss that you become a housewife and it's just heaven."
Joan Williams, author of "Unbending Gender: Why Family and Work Conflict and What to Do About It," argues that domesticity is the root of the problem.
This gender based economic system arose about 1780, and still drives the U.S. workplace, which is comprised of two types of workers: the ideal, who works full time and has no time to raise children, and the family caregiver, who is marginalized, cut off from professional and social advancement.
"Once the focus shifts away from women's choices to the gender system that sets the frame within which those choices occur, we can see that domesticity's peculiar structuring of market work and family work hurts not only women but also men, children, politics and our emotional life," she wrote.
Williams, an American University law professor, is director of the Program on WorkLife Law, which seeks to eliminate employment discrimination against caregivers.
She's optimistic about motherhood and social action.
"Since the 1970s women have accomplished something stunning," she says.
"The U.S. is probably the best country in the world for women who are willing to live the biographies of a male.
But it's probably one of the worst countries in the world for mothers.
"So the next frontier is to change the family hostile atmosphere for men as well as women.
That will jump start the stalled revolution."
Throughout its lifetime, feminism has spawned its share of catchphrases and epithets.
Simone de Beauvoir gave us "the second sex."
Betty Friedan invented "the feminine mystique."
Arlie Hochschild labeled the daily housework that followed office work "the second shift," while Rush Limbaugh contributed "feminazis" to the discourse.
Now another phrase choice feminism is suddenly gaining currency, while managing to annoy people on the left, right and just about everywhere in between.
This seemingly innocuous term, coined by a lawyer and scholar, Linda R. Hirshman, in the December issue of The American Prospect, refers to the popular feminist philosophy that in her words declares "a woman could work, stay home, have 10 children or one, marry or stay single."
"It all counted as 'feminist' as long as she chose it," Hirshman wrote.
The concepts behind choice feminism took over the mainstream in the 1980s, replacing more militant agendas that derided or neglected family life.
The idea was that women should decide for themselves how to combine children, career, romance and vacuuming.
What it didn't tell them was how to make the right decision.
Figuring out the balance between home and work turned out to be a lot trickier than anyone thought.
Hirshman would like to help though not in a way many women would welcome.
In her article she denounced choice feminism as a con.
It promised liberation, she said, but actually betrayed women by leaving traditional sex roles intact.
In short, women were still stuck with the housework and child rearing.
The public sphere, outside the home, she argued, is the only place where women can fully flourish.
And that, she proclaimed, is where they should be.
She issued a few simple rules: Marry someone poorer or socially inferior, increase your tolerance of dust.
And, as she puts it: "Have a baby.
Just don't have two."
On the Web and elsewhere, responses were quick, numerous and fierce.
There were a few supporters, but many more critics.
Conservatives saw her argument as another example of how feminists are intent on destroying the family.
Liberals criticized her for being authoritarian and defining success only by money and status.
Mothers denounced her for just about everything.
What is perhaps most surprising, though, is not that feminists like Hirshman believe homemaking is second class drudgery, but that so many people still get worked up over the issue.
After all, feminist thinkers have been proclaiming the need to free women from the bondage of housework for a long time.
It is, as Hirshman freely acknowledges, precisely what Friedan argued in "The Feminine Mystique," first published more than 40 years ago.
"The only kind of work which permits an able woman to realize her abilities fully," Friedan wrote, "is the kind that was forbidden by the feminine mystique, the lifelong commitment to an art or science, to politics or profession."
Not homemaking, not motherhood.
In an interview, Hirshman said that in the course of researching a book, she began to wonder when feminism switched from offering a clear blueprint for liberation to choosing from Column A and Column B. "I was curious to see when we got to the place when they decided to sidestep the definition of the good life by Friedan," she said, "to whatever floats your boats."
She traced the change to the late '80s, when the women's movement decided to frame the debate over legalized abortion as a question of a woman's choice.
The language, she says, "spilled over."
That Hirshman's views on family life now sound so radical is a testament to how roundly the mainstream has rejected them.
While rigid doctrines may have made sense in the early days, they don't now, when major goals have been won and a more diverse group of women are in the picture.
Indeed, the common critique of the women's movement in the '60s and '70s was that it was too elitist and dogmatic, that it didn't respect women who wanted to stay home.
Choice feminism was an adjustment to reality.
But reality, of course, is messy and confusing.
It's not clear what should give when women are still responsible for a disproportionate share of the housework, they miss their children while they're at work all day, good child care is expensive, and time off or part time work hampers a career.
In the continuing Web discussion about Hirshman's article, many women angry with her conclusions still agreed with her complaints about the unequal burden between men and women for home and family.
A Web site called the Half Changed World, for example, written by a self described mom and policy wonk, said: "I honestly don't know what's going to break through the domestic glass ceiling.
I used to think that it just was going to take time, that of course the younger generation would adopt a more equitable distribution of labor.
I don't see that happening."
Choice feminism doesn't provide any formula or model for happily balancing family, work, love, chores, play, sleep and more.
Nothing does anymore.
"We've been living through this massive transformation where those predictable pathways have really eroded," said Kathleen Gerson, a New York University sociologist.
That is why edicts that order women either to get out of the house or to stay there inevitably resurface.
Issuing marching orders is simple.
"Viva la revolucion!" is a lot catchier than "Muddle Through!"
It's just not helpful.
Betty Friedan, the feminist crusader and author whose searing first book, "The Feminine Mystique," ignited the contemporary women's movement in 1963 and in so doing permanently transformed the social fabric of the United States and countries around the world, died Saturday, her 85th birthday, at her home in Washington.
The cause was congestive heart failure, said Emily Bazelon, a family spokeswoman.
With its impassioned yet clear eyed analysis of the issues that affected women's lives in the decades after World War II including enforced domesticity, limited career prospects and, as chronicled in later editions, the campaign for legalized abortion "The Feminine Mystique" is widely regarded as one of the most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century.
Published by W.W. Norton & Co., the book had sold more than 3 million copies by the year 2000 and has been translated into many foreign languages.
For decades a familiar presence on television and the lecture circuit, Friedan, with her short stature, round figure, protuberant nose and deeply hooded eyes, looked for much of her adult life like a "combination of Hermione Gingold and Bette Davis," as Judy Klemesrud wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 1970.
"The Feminine Mystique" made Friedan world famous.
It also made her one of the chief architects of the women's liberation movement of the late 1960s and afterward, a sweeping social upheaval that harked back to the suffrage campaigns of the turn of the century and would be called feminism's second wave.
In 1966, Friedan helped found the National Organization for Women, serving as its first president.
In 1969, she was a founder of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, now known as Naral Pro Choice America.
With Gloria Steinem and Bella Abzug, she founded the Women's Political Caucus in 1971.
Though in later years, some feminists dismissed Friedan's work as outmoded, a great many aspects of modern life that seem routine today from unisex Help Wanted ads to women in politics, medicine, the clergy and the military are the direct result of the hard won advances she helped women attain.
A brilliant student who had graduated summa cum laude from Smith College in 1942, Friedan had trained as a psychologist but had never pursued a career in the field.
When she wrote "The Feminine Mystique," she was a suburban housewife and mother who supplemented her husband's income by writing freelance articles for women's magazines.
Though Friedan was not generally considered a lyrical stylist, "The Feminine Mystique," read today, is as mesmerizing as it was more than four decades ago: "Gradually, without seeing it clearly for quite a while, I came to realize that something is very wrong with the way American women are trying to lives their lives today," Friedan wrote in the opening line of the preface.
"I sensed it first as a question mark in my own life, as a wife and mother of three small children, half guiltily, and therefore half heartedly, almost in spite of myself, using my abilities and education in work that took me away from home."
The words have the hypnotic pull of a fairy tale, and for the next 400 pages, Friedan identifies, dissects and damningly indicts one of the most pervasive folk beliefs of postwar American life: the myth of suburban women's domestic fulfillment she came to call the feminine mystique.
Drawing on history, psychology, sociology and economics, as well as on interviews she conducted with women across the country, Friedan charted the gradual metamorphosis of the American woman from the independent, career minded New Woman of the 1920s and '30s into the vacant, aproned housewife of the postwar years.
The portrait she painted was chilling.
For a typical woman of the 1950s, even a college educated one, life centered almost exclusively on chores and children.
She cooked and baked and bandaged and chauffeured and laundered and sewed.
She did the mopping and the marketing and took her husband's gray flannel suit to the cleaners.
She was happy to keep his dinner warm till he came wearily home from downtown.
The life she led, if educators, psychologists and the media were to be believed, was the fulfillment of every women's most ardent dream.
Yet she was unaccountably tired, impatient with the children, craving something that neither marital sex nor extramarital affairs could satisfy.
Her thoughts sometimes turned to suicide.
She consulted a spate doctors and psychiatrists, who prescribed charity work, bowling and bridge.
If those failed, there were always tranquilizers to get her through her day.
A Nebraska housewife with a Ph.D. in anthropology whom Friedan interviewed told her: "A film made of any typical morning in my house would look like an old Marx Brothers comedy.
I wash the dishes, rush the older children off to school, dash out in the yard to cultivate the chrysanthemums, run back in to make a phone call about a committee meeting, help the youngest child build a blockhouse, spend fifteen minutes skimming the newspapers so I can be well informed, then scamper down to the washing machines where my thrice weekly laundry includes enough clothes to keep a primitive village going for an entire year.
By noon I'm ready for a padded cell.
Very little of what I've done has been really necessary or important.
Outside pressures lash me though the day.
Yet I look upon myself as one of the more relaxed housewives in the neighborhood."
"The Feminine Mystique" began as a survey Friedan conducted in 1957 for the 15th reunion of her graduating class at Smith.
It was intended to refute a prevailing postwar myth: that higher education kept women from adapting to their roles as wives and mothers.
Judging from her own capable life, Friedan expected her classmates to describe theirs as similarly well adjusted.
But what she discovered in the women's responses was something far more complex, and more troubling a "nameless, aching dissatisfaction" that she would famously call "the problem that has no name."
When Friedan sent the same questionnaire to graduates of Radcliff and other colleges, and later interviewed scores of women personally, the results were the same.
The women's answers gave her the seeds of her book.
They also forced her to confront the painful limitations of her own suburban idyll.
Bettye Naomi Goldstein was born on Feb 4, 1921, in Peoria, Ill.
Her father, Harry, was an immigrant from Russia who parlayed a street corner collar button business into a prosperous downtown jewelry store.
Her gifted, imperious mother, Miriam, had been the editor of the women's page of the local newspaper before giving up her job for marriage and children.
Only years later, when she was writing "The Feminine Mystique," did Friedan come to see her mother's cold, critical demeanor as masking a deep bitterness at giving up the work she loved.
Growing up brainy, Jewish, outspoken and, by the standards of the time, unlovely, Bettye was ostracized.
She was barred from the fashionable sororities at her Peoria high school and rarely asked on dates.
It was an experience, she would later say, that made her identify with people on the margins of society.
At Smith, she blossomed.
For the first time, she could be as smart as she wanted, as impassioned as she wanted and as loud as she wanted, and for four happy years she was all those things.
Betty received her bachelor's degree in 1942 by that time she had dropped the final "e," which she considered an affectation of her mother's and accepted a fellowship to the University of California, Berkeley, for graduate work in psychology.
At Berkeley, she studied with the renowned psychologist Erik Erikson, among others.
She won a second fellowship, even more prestigious than the first, that would allow her to continue for doctorate.
But she was dating a young physicist who felt threatened by her success.
He pressured her to turn down the fellowship, and she did, an experience she would later recount frequently in interviews.
She also turned down the physicist, returning home to Peoria before moving to Greenwich Village in New York.
There, Friedan worked as an editor at The Federated Press, a small news service that provided stories to labor newspapers nationwide.
In 1946, she took a job as a reporter with U.E. News, the weekly publication of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America.
In 1947, she married Carl Friedan, a theater director who later became an advertising executive.
They started a family and moved to a rambling Victorian house in suburban Rockland County, N.Y. Betty Friedan, whose marriage would end in divorce in 1969, is survived by their three children, Daniel Friedan of Princeton, N.J., Emily Friedan of Buffalo, N.Y., and Jonathan Friedan of Philadelphia, a brother, Harry Goldstein, of Palm Springs, Calif., and Purchase, N.Y., a sister, Amy Adams, of New York City, and nine grandchildren.
"The Feminine Mystique" had the misfortune to appear during a newspaper printers' strike.
The reviews that appeared afterward ran the gamut from bewildered to outraged to cautiously laudatory.
Some critics also felt that Friedan had insufficiently acknowledged her debt to Simone de Beauvoir, whose 1949 book, "The Second Sex," dealt with many of the same issues.
Writing in The New York Times Book Review in April 1963, Lucy Freeman called "The Feminine Mystique" a "highly readable, provocative book," but went on to question its basic premise, writing, of Friedan: "Sweeping generalities, in which this book necessarily abounds, may hold a certain amount of truth but often obscure the deeper issues.
It is superficial to blame the 'culture' and its handmaidens, the women's magazines, as she does.
What is to stop a woman who is interested in national and international affairs from reading magazines that deal with those subjects?
To paraphrase a famous line, 'The fault, dear Mrs Friedan, is not in our culture, but in ourselves."'
Among readers, however, the response to the book was so overwhelming that Friedan realized she needed more than words to address the condition of women's lives.
After moving back to Manhattan with her family, she was determined to start a progressive organization that would be the equivalent, as she often said, of an NAACP for women.
In 1966, Friedan and a group of colleagues founded the National Organization for Women.
She was its president until 1970.
One of NOW's most visible public actions was the Women's Strike For Equality, held on Aug 26, 1970, in New York and in cities around the country.
In New York, tens of thousands of woman marched down Fifth Avenue, with Friedan in the lead.
(Before the march, she made a point of lunching at Whyte's, a downtown restaurant formerly open to men only.)
Carrying signs and banners ("Don't Cook Dinner Starve a Rat Tonight!"
"Don't Iron while the Strike Is Hot"), women of all ages, along with a number of sympathetic men, marched joyfully down the street to cheering crowds.
The march ended with a rally in Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library, with passionate speeches by Friedan, Steinem, Abzug and Kate Millett.
Not all of Friedan's ventures were as successful.
The First Women's Bank and Trust Co., which she helped found in 1973, is no longer in business.
Nor were even her indomitable presence and relentless energy enough to secure passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.
Though widely respected as a modern day heroine, Friedan was by no means universally beloved, even or perhaps especially by members of the women's movement.
She was famously abrasive.
She could be thin skinned and imperious, subject to screaming fits of temperament.
In the 1970s and afterward, some feminists criticized Friedan for focusing almost exclusively on the concerns of middle class married white women and ignoring those of women of color, lesbians and the poor.
Some called her retrograde for insisting that women could, and should, live in collaborative partnership with men.
Friedan's private life was also famously stormy.
In her recent memoir, "Life So Far" (Simon & Schuster, 2000), she accused her husband of being physically abusive during their marriage, writing that he sometimes gave her black eyes, which she concealed with make up at public events and on television.
Carl Friedan has repeatedly denied the accusations.
In an interview with Time magazine in 2000, shortly after the memoir's publication, he called Friedan's account a "complete fabrication."
He added: "I am the innocent victim of a drive by shooting by a reckless driver savagely aiming at the whole male gender."
Betty Friedan's other books include "It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women's Movement" (Random House, 1976), "The Second Stage" (Summit, 1981), and "The Fountain of Age" (Simon & Schuster, 1993).
The recipient of many awards and honorary degrees, she was a visiting professor at universities around the country, among them Columbia, Temple and the University of Southern California.
In recent years, Friedan was associated with the Institute for Women and Work at Cornell University.
Despite all of her later achievements, Friedan would be forever known as the suburban housewife who started a revolution with "The Feminine Mystique."
Rarely has a single book been responsible for such sweeping, tumultuous and continuing social transformation.
The new society Friedan proposed, founded on the notion that men and women were created equal, represented such a drastic upending of the prevailing social norms that over the years to come, she would be forced to explain her position again and again.
"Some people think I'm saying, 'Women of the world unite you have nothing to lose but your men,"' she told Life magazine in 1963.
"It's not true.
You have nothing to lose but your vacuum cleaners."
Hillary '08.
The inevitability campaign now underway demonstrates everything bad about modern American politics.
Two months into George W. Bush's second term as president, a cadre of Hillary Clinton supporters is trying to lock up the Democratic presidential nomination for New York's junior senator.
One supporter is her husband, former president Bill Clinton, who declares that his wife would make an excellent president.
Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware also predicts "she is likely to be the nominee."
So, case closed?
No other Democrats need apply?
That is ridiculous.
For once, some political insiders are trying to put the fix in for a woman for president.
But a smoke filled room of political power brokers handpicking a female presidential nominee is no more appealing than one that selects one of the boys.
And it is likely to be just as inefficient when it comes to choosing a winner.
Democratic loyalists exerted all their influence to derail former Vermont governor Howard Dean and make Massachusetts Senator John Kerry the party nominee in 2004.
With help from Dean and voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, they succeeded.
Then Kerry lost in November.
Hillary Clinton has a strong case to make to Democrats and independents.
She is a celebrity politician who can raise money.
Early polls put her ahead of Kerry and other Democratic presidential hopefuls.
Results from one recent poll showed that six in 10 voters believe that the United States is ready for a female president, and 53 percent thought Hillary Clinton should try for the job.
She has the next three years to build her case ndash and so should other Democrats with different ideas about party direction and agenda.
As a couple, the Clintons are skilled at political repositioning.
Right now it's all about grabbing the middle, as defined by the 2004 presidential election.
Hillary Clinton went public with the view that avoiding abortion is the correct goal for prochoice advocates.
She reached out to religious conservatives with an endorsement of faith based initiatives.
With her 2006 reelection campaign approaching, she is wooing New York Republicans.
She backs the Bush doctrine in Iraq.
As for Bill Clinton, at the request of President George W. Bush, he is leading the US tsunami relief effort with former President George H.W. Bush.
On their tour of tsunami damage in Southeast Asia, Clinton allowed the elder Bush to sleep on the plane's only bed while he stretched out on the floor, according to Newsweek.
In this instance, Clinton's dedication to the cause could be viewed as a political two fer: tsunami relief and Hillary '08.
It projects a beautiful photo op to red state America.
But is it beautiful enough to make Clinton haters forget why they hate the Clintons?
To believe that is naive.
It also fails to acknowledge the GOP's well established path to victory.
Republican campaign strategists create their own image of the Democratic challenger, they do not accept the image promoted by the opposition.
The GOP inspired image is seared into voters' minds through relentless advertising, talking points, and conservative talking heads.
So far, Democrats have not come up with a successful antidote.
In 2004, Republicans ndash with help from the Democratic candidate ndash made sure the Democratic nominee was John Kerry, flip flopper and Vietnam War protester, not John Kerry, political centrist and Vietnam War hero.
If Hillary Clinton is the Democratic presidential nominee in 2008, the GOP will run against Hillary Clinton as defined by the GOP, not as defined by the Democratic Party.
In the end, the Clintons may be resilient and resourceful enough to beat back Republican spin doctors.
They certainly have experience doing so.
But no one should be fooled into believing that electing a woman generally and Hillary Clinton specifically will happen easily.
It will take hundreds of millions of dollars, tremendous will, and ugly political warfare.
In remarks following a recent speech at Wellesley College, Hillary Clinton's alma mater, feminist Betty Friedan scoffed at the notion of a presidential face off between two women, Clinton and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
"It will never happen," she said.
It might, in politics, anything can happen.
But it's too early to pick a presidential candidate and way too early to try to dictate who should be a party's presidential nominee.

Last month, Adelphia Communications became the first American cable company to offer its subscribers triple X rated pornography.
Adelphia's role as porn pioneer struck some as a bit unlikely: Five years ago the company had dropped Spice, a popular softcore pornography channel, because the company's since disgraced founder and CEO, John Rigas, found it offensive.
Asked about the reversal, a company spokeswoman replied succinctly, "People want it, so we are trying to provide it.
The more Xs, the more popular."
Indeed, revenues from pay per view and video on demand adult movies have quadrupled since the late 1990s as cable operators have started airing more explicit erotic material.
And it's not just cable television that's embraced the truly lewd.
Movies like "Boogie Nights" and the recent documentary "Inside Deep Throat" have portrayed the adult industry as an enclave for good hearted, rough edged misfits and cultural freedom fighters.
Last fall the memoir of porn superstar Jenna Jameson spent a month and a half on the New York Times bestseller list.
And the industry itself continues to grow at a torrid pace: Hard numbers are difficult to find, but estimates put it at anywhere from a $3 billion to $14 billion a year industry.
In response, a predictable political debate has emerged, with cultural conservatives standing athwart the tide yelling "Stop!"
while left leaning civil libertarians brandish the First Amendment.
But there's a voice that's been conspicuously absent in the current debate: anti pornography feminists.
In "Inside Deep Throat," it is prominent feminists like Gloria Steinem and Susan Brownmiller, as much as decency crusaders like Charles Keating, who get credit for shutting down the nationwide porn party that "Deep Throat" kicked off in 1972.
"The worst censors in the country," Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz says in an onscreen interview, "were the feminists."
The characterization is of a piece with the documentary's cartoony glibness.
Still, today, as social conservatives lead the campaign to rid the airwaves of the taint of sex, it's easy to forget that the most powerful anti pornography legislation ever passed in this country was written not by cultural conservatives but radical feminists led by legal scholar Catharine A. MacKinnon and author Andrea Dworkin.
MacKinnon and Dworkin's efforts depended on support from notorious bluenoses like Phyllis Schlafly and former attorney general Edwin Meese.
But the two women's brief against pornography went beyond simply attacking its lasciviousness.
They argued that its aestheticized visions of female degradation actually incited men to violence.
In 1974 the writer and activist Robin Morgan had put it most starkly: "Pornography is the theory, rape is the practice."
MacKinnon and Dworkin's antipornography statutes which passed in Indianapolis and Bellingham, Wash., and were defeated in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and Cambridge made little use of obscenity standards and instead reframed the issue as one of sex discrimination.
While their bills didn't ban porn outright, they allowed women to sue pornographers for damages.
And those damages, the anti porn feminists argued, weren't merely abstract.
During the debates over the local ordinances, and in testimony before Edwin Meese's Commission on Pornography in 1985, MacKinnon and others arranged for often horrifying testimony by women on the physical and mental abuse they had suffered either in the making of pornography or at the hands of men they claimed had been inspired by it.
Some of the most dramatic testimony was from Linda Lovelace, star of "Deep Throat."
So what happened to those voices?
Now a law professor at the University of Michigan, MacKinnon has a new book out this month, "Women's Lives, Men's Laws" (Belknap), which includes essays and speeches on pornography, but in recent years she and Dworkin seem to have lost not just the legal battle but the cultural war.
These days, "sex positive" feminists like Laura Kipnis or Camille Paglia tend to get the airtime.
And in the universities, women's studies scholars are more likely to do close readings of the aesthetics and politics of pornography than to march in favor of banning it.
Even at the time, MacKinnon and Dworkin's campaign sharply split the feminist movement.
While supported by leading figures like Steinem and Brownmiller, the Indianapolis law in particular galvanized others in opposition.
They formed the Feminist Anti Censorship Taskforce, or FACT.
When the law's constitutionality was being decided by a federal appeals court, FACT submitted an amicus brief signed by Betty Friedan, Rita Mae Brown, Kate Millet, Adrienne Rich and others opposing it.
Torn between the conflicting arguments, the National Organization of Women was unable to take a position.
MacKinnon's description of her opponents, in a 1987 speech, was typical of the heated rhetoric: "The Black movement has Uncle Toms and Oreo cookies.
The labor movement had scabs.
The women's movement has FACT."
Starting in the late 1980s some feminist scholars also began to see porn as a tool that women could appropriate to liberate themselves from patriarchal norms of behavior and beauty.
Porn sexuality, they argued, wasn't simply about subjugation.
Instead, "what pornography is trying to do is create, using real bodies, a fantasy of a kind of idealized and perfectly abundant pleasure," says Linda Williams, a film studies professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and a leading porn theorist.
What others might see as basically a masturbatory aid was cast instead as a genre of utopian social criticism.
As for the anti porn crusaders, Williams adds: "Really, who are they to tell us where our sexual imaginations should go?"
So it was a deeply divided feminist movement that faced the failure of MacKinnon and Dworkin's laws, not only in places like Los Angeles and Cambridge, but when they were eventually struck down by federal courts in both Indiana and Washington.
As Joshua Cohen, an MIT political science professor who has studied the First Amendment ramifications of the laws, puts it, "A lot of the energy that went into the issue during the 1980s was focused on these legal strategies."
When they failed, he says, "It became pretty clear that legal regulations directed to stop pornography were not going to be accepted by the courts, and that probably sapped some of the energy from the anti pornography movement."
Even where they did survive, the laws had unintended and often crudely ironic consequences.
In Canada, which in 1992 adopted MacKinnon and Dworkin's definition of pornography, it was used largely to prosecute gay and lesbian bookstores and even to seize copies of two of Dworkin's books because they "illegally eroticized pain and bondage."
Today, Mackinnon bristles at the old charge that anti porn feminists were, in effect, in bed with the political right.
"I actually know who I'm in bed with," she said in a recent interview.
"This was just something created by the pornographers to scare liberals off, which doesn't take much."
But her language has been adopted by some on the right.
Now, according to Janet LaRue of Concerned Women for America, "It may be that we're not hearing as much from the traditional hardline feminist organizations, but when I write and speak on the topic of pornography, one of the aspects that I point out is that it certainly subjugates and degrades women and reduces us to the sum or our body parts."
But perhaps it's porn's very ubiquity that has most weakened the anti pornography case, feminist and conservative.
Thanks to the growth of home video pornography in the 1980s and the more recent shift to the Internet, far more people have access to X rated material than ever before.
As Williams puts it, "In a way I think MacKinnon and Dworkin were able to invoke the kind of horror that they did at pornography at a time when not as many people had seen it.
For better or for worse, now it has become part of the vernacular of our way of talking about picturing sex to ourselves."
MacKinnon agrees, though she sees the shift as more insidious: "The data just show that pornography sets community standards, so the more pornography there is, the less will be seen to be wrong with it.
It's just its own intrinsic dynamic."
Despite the recent backlash against television indecency, pornography prosecutions remain rare.
The Bush administration has picked up the pace from the Clinton administration, creating a special anti porn unit in the Department of Justice and hiring Bruce Taylor, the prosecutor who went after Larry Flynt in 1981, as its porn czar.
Last month, the Justice Department announced that it would appeal a recent decision by a federal judge that declared federal obscenity laws unconstitutional.
And speaking earlier this week, the new attorney general, Alberto Gonzales, listed "the aggressive prosecution of purveyors of obscene materials" among his top priorities.
Still, Frederick Schauer, a First Amendment scholar at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, points out that "criminal obscenity prosecutions have come close to disappearing, they're constitutionally permissible but almost nonexistent,The legal definition of obscenity remains very, very, very narrow."
As for MacKinnon, since the early 1990s she has focused on international issues like prostitution, human trafficking, and war crimes.
(In 2000, she won a war crimes conviction against the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic for the rape of Muslim and Croat women during the Bosnian War.)
But she says pornography is still a central issue for her.
"Until a problem is solved, it's always a good time to solve it," she says.
"Whether people want to solve it is another question."

Betty Friedan, the visionary, combative feminist who launched a social revolution with her provocative 1963 book, "The Feminine Mystique," died Saturday, which was her 85th birthday.
Friedan died of congestive heart failure at her home in Washington, D.C., according to Emily Bazelon, a cousin who was speaking for the family.
She said Friedan had been in failing health for some time.
Her best selling book identified "the problem that has no name," the unhappiness of post World War II American women unfulfilled by traditional notions of female domesticity.
Melding sociology and humanistic psychology, the book became the cornerstone of one of the last century's most profound movements, unleashing the first full flowering of American feminism since the 1800s.
It gave Friedan, an obscure suburban New York housewife and freelance writer, the mantle to meet with popes and heads of state and to lead an international movement that would shake up marriage and the workplace, politics and education.
She founded the National Organization for Women in 1966, making it the first new feminist organization in a half century.
She also was among the founders of the National Women's Political Caucus and the group that became the National Abortion Rights Action League.
"I never set out to write a book to change women's lives, to change history," said Friedan, who always kept a sense of wonder about her place in history as the mother of the contemporary women's movement.
"It's like, 'Who, me?'
Yes, me.
I did it.
And I'm not that different from other women,Maybe my power and glory was that I could speak my truth as a woman and it was the truth of every woman."
Friedan's affinity with mainstream values was the foundation of her authority.
Her emphatic belief that women should have equal rights but not at the expense of alienating men distinguished her from many feminist leaders who emerged later.
"She found that love between unequals can never succeed," Gloria Steinem once said, "and she has undertaken the immense job of bringing up the status of women so love can succeed."
Her more moderate brand of feminism, combined with her often irascible nature, led to ruptures with other movement leaders, such as Steinem and the late Bella Abzug.
Some feminists eventually denounced her as a reactionary.
By the 1980s, feminism had ceased being her primary focus, and she spent her last decades focused on issues of aging, families, work and public policy.
(Begin optional trim) Friedan did not conform to conventional notions of feminine beauty or decorum.She was loud, fast talking, impatient and abrasive.
She remained formidable in her old age.
Even as she was approaching 80 and enjoying her role as doting grandmother of nine, she could demolish interviewers who asked what she considered inane questions.
Friedan, from Peoria, Ill., was born Bettye Goldstein on Feb 4, 1921, the year after American women won the right to vote.
She was the oldest of three children of Harry Goldstein, a Russian Jewish jewelry store owner, and the former Miriam Horwitz.
Betty (who later dropped the "e" from the end of her first name) was precocious and skipped a year of school.
In high school, she was valedictorian but her braininess, she said, made her feel "like a freak."
Anti Semitism barred her father, a successful businessman, from joining the country club and other elite Peoria circles, and it kept Betty and her sister out of high school sororities.
Her mother was an unhappy housewife whose disposition and health dramatically improved when her husband's health faltered and she took over management of the jewelry business.
In a 1976 book, "It Changed My Life," Friedan said her mother's discontent gave her an early glimpse of the perils of the malaise she would later call the "feminine mystique."
Friedan did not feel at home until she arrived at Smith College in the late 1930s.
She became editor of the campus newspaper and quickly established a reputation for brilliance.
She finished summa cum laude in psychology in 1942 and entered graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley.
At Berkeley, she won a prestigious science fellowship that had never been given to a psychologist, much less a female.
But she turned the award down when it became apparent that her success threatened a physicist she had been dating.
Although she said she had little, if any, awareness of it at the time, she was fearful of being "brighter than the boys" and violating the mystique she would dissect later.
Against the advice of her professors, who included the eminent theorist Erik Erikson, she gave up psychology all together.
Having discovered Marxism in college, Friedan decided that she would work for the "revolution."
By 1943, she was immersed in popular front journalism, first at The Federated Press in New York and later at UE News, the official newspaper of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, then one of the nation's most radical unions.
In 1947 she married a theatrical producer named Carl Friedman, who later dropped the "m" in his last name to create the more distinctive "Friedan."
In 1948 the Friedans had the first of three children, Daniel.
Four years later when she became pregnant with her second child, Jonathan, and requested maternity leave, she was fired from her job at the union paper, an event she later would call a "formative experience" in her evolution as a feminist.
Her third child, Emily, was born in 1956.
Although she was determined to be a happy housewife, she suffered renewed attacks of her childhood asthma and resumed psychotherapy.
Urged by her therapist not to waste her education and training, Betty Friedan began to write for women's magazines.
She had wanted to write a profile of a woman who had given up a successful career as an advertising executive, married and become a serious sculptor, but editors were doubtful that their housewife readers would be interested in such a woman.
They accepted the article but only after deleting references to the subject's career.
Within a few years, Friedan said, "I began to lose my zest (for writing the formulaic articles of women's magazines)."
In 1957, she was asked to conduct a survey of her Smith classmates for their 15th reunion.
She found that the women who did not conform exactly to traditional notions of womanhood were happier than those who did.
"Maybe it wasn't education that was the problem, keeping American women from 'adjusting to their role as women,' " she wrote, "but that narrow definition of 'the role of women.'
" She wrote a magazine article based on that argument, but it was repeatedly rejected.
She decided to bypass that venue and put her ideas into a book instead.
She interviewed scores of suburban women.
Another part of her research entailed long days in the New York Public Library, looking for shifts in the types of heroines depicted in women's magazine fiction.
The results of her study were stark: Friedan found that the avid career woman who dominated the magazines in the 1930s had given way by the 1950s to a less adventuresome model: the contented homemaker.
Was the 1950s image reality, or was it a self fulfilling fantasy cooked up by magazine editors and advertisers?
Friedan was staggered by the dissatisfactions aired by wives and mothers, by their vague laments about feeling empty, desperate and incomplete.
A mother of four who had bypassed college for marriage and family told Friedan: "There's no problem you can even put a name to.
But I'm desperate.
I begin to feel I have no personality.
I'm a server of food and putter on of pants and a bed maker, somebody who can be called on when you want something.
But who am I?"
" ,I came to realize," Friedan later wrote, "that something is very wrong with the way American women are trying to live their lives today,For the startling pattern that began to emerge as one clue led me to another in far flung fields of modern thought and life, defied not only the conventional image but basic psychological assumptions about women."
She found that books on the psychology of women generally adhered to traditional ideas of women's fulfillment in hearth and home.
Seeking a theoretical basis for her views of women's plight, Friedan turned to the work on identity and self realization by psychologists including Abraham Maslow and Erik Erikson.
Their ideas informed what became her central tenet: "that the core of the problem for women today is ,a problem of identity a stunting or evasion of growth that is perpetuated by the feminine mystique."
Friedan finally produced a 1000 page manuscript.
It took her five years.
Friedan's publisher, W. W. Norton, printed only a few thousand hardcover copies in 1963.
Friedan did not experience the full force of fame until Dell issued the paperback in 1964.
That year, "The Feminine Mystique" became the top selling nonfiction book in the country.
Much of the initial reaction was not favorable.
Friedan was cursed, told to seek psychiatric help and accused of posing "more of a threat to the United States than the Russians."
She was shunned by neighborhood women, her children were kicked out of car pools, and her marriage began to crack under the weight of her growing celebrity.
To many black women more concerned with survival than self fulfillment, Friedan's call to women to find meaningful careers "seemed to come from another planet," according to historian Paula Giddings.
The personal narrative that gave "Feminine Mystique" much of its power was misleading in another way: It omitted references to Friedan's earlier career as a left wing journalist, creating the impression that the author had never been anything other than a suburban matron.
Years later, biographer Daniel Horowitz would accuse Friedan of obscuring her past to sell books.
But Friedan insisted she was only being politically savvy.
"It was the McCarthy era ,and I didn't go around parading my left wing background because it wouldn't have helped in organizing the women's movement," she told the Los Angeles Times a few years ago.
"On the other hand, I never kept it secret."
"The Feminine Mystique" was so astute in its analysis that, as futurist Alvin Toffler said, it "pulled the trigger on history."
The book launched a tumultuous decade for American women, with Friedan at the epicenter.
In June 1966, Friedan joined members of state commissions on the status of women for a national conference in Washington, D.C. Four months later, they reconvened and Friedan was elected president of the nascent National Organization for Women.
Among its signature success was lobbying President Lyndon Johnson to sign an Executive Order prohibiting sex discrimination by federal contractors.
Today, the group is anchored in Washington, D.C., and has 500000 members and branches in all 50 states.
But in its early years, NOW's headquarters was Friedan's New York City apartment and Friedan was indisputably in charge.
In 1970, the largest feminist demonstration since the suffrage movement took over Fifth Avenue when Friedan called for a national Women's Strike for Equality.
Held on the 50th anniversary of the passage of the women's suffrage amendment, it drew 500000 women.
But during these heady years, Friedan's marriage was crumbling.
She claimed years later to have been a battered wife, a contention that outraged Carl Friedan, who vociferously denied the charges.
Their 22 year marriage ended in divorce in 1969.
In 1970, Friedan would step down as NOW president amid growing dissatisfaction with her vision of the movement.
But not even her critics could deny the power of the changes she had unleashed.
By this time the mother of the movement was being assaulted by its more radical elements.
In 1969 she had delivered her first public attack on lesbianism, labeling it a "lavender menace" that would tarnish the entire feminist agenda.
Enraged, many lesbians quit NOW.
By the end of the 1970s, Friedan was relegated to the sidelines of the movement she had inspired.
She was dismayed not only by its direction but what she saw as its mounting toll and the growing political backlash.
As she saw it, the movement had burdened rather than liberated women, burning out those who were trying to juggle motherhood and career or penetrate the corporate glass ceiling.
Moreover, she observed, women in lower level jobs were still earning only 59 cents to every dollar earned by men this after almost two decades of renewed feminist activism.
Friedan's response was "The Second Stage," published in 1981.
The movement's senior theorist always had insisted that men were not the enemy.
In her new book, startlingly, she suggested that the enemy was the victim herself.
"I believe we have to break through our own feminist mystique," Friedan wrote, arguing that, "The equality we fought for isn't livable, isn't workable, isn't comfortable in the terms that structured our battle."
Feminists, she charged, had fallen into a new trap "which denied that core of women's personhood that is fulfilled through love, nurture, home, Calling the feminist foremother "hopelessly confused about whose side she's on," theorist Ellen Willis wrote that Friedan "would destroy feminism in order to save it, and beat the Moral Majority by joining it."
Journalist Susan Faludi, writing in her 1991 book "Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women," said Friedan was "yanking out the stitches in her own handiwork."
Friedan began to turn her focus to other issues.
She received a call from the head of the National Institute on Aging, asking her to become an advocate for older Americans.
She at first fought the idea, "locked in denial" about the encroaching reality of her own aging she was approaching 60 and hating it.
What changed her mind was remembering conversations she'd had with older women while researching "The Feminine Mystique."
The healthiest and most vital women she interviewed had been older women in their 50s and 60s who had careers.
In 1993 she published "The Fountain of Age," a book in which she again challenged the prevailing stereotypes and argued that an active, engaged life was the secret to a good old age.
The book earned mixed reviews, with some critics faulting her for presenting an overly optimistic view of the stage of life Friedan herself was experiencing.
(End optional trim) In her last years, Friedan split her time between homes in Sag Harbor, N.Y., and Washington, D.C.
She spent more time with her children Daniel, a theoretical physicist at Rutgers University who won a MacArthur Foundation genius grant, Jonathan, an engineer in Philadelphia, and Emily, a pediatrician in Buffalo, N.Y. and their families.
Friedan wrote six books and had teaching posts at many institutions, including Yale, Harvard, the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Southern California.
Surgery in 1997 to replace an infected aortic valve slowed her down only a little.
A few years later, she was a distinguished visiting professor at Cornell University, where she used a $1 million Ford Foundation grant to conduct a three year study on women, men, work, family and public policy.
She continued to deplore the lack of progress on issues that affected the quality of family life, such as flexible scheduling and better and more affordable child care.
Yet she seemed to look back on her life with immense pleasure, saying that the women's movement had succeeded in the United States and other advanced countries beyond her wildest imaginings.
"I thought once," she said, "about what should be put on my gravestone: 'She helped make women feel better about being women and therefore better able to freely and fully love men.'
I try very, very hard not to think of the conservative movement as a gaggle of thick skulled fanatics.
To help me along in this process, I seek out well reasoned commentary from conservative intellectuals such as Tod Lindberg of The Washington Times and Ramesh Ponnuru of the National Review.
But my efforts at ideological toleration inevitably get spoiled when something comes along like Human Events magazine's list of the "Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th Centuries."
Human Events is a conservative weekly that Ronald Reagan was known to favor, and which the Wall Street Journal called a "bible of the right."
It compiled its list by polling a panel of conservative academics (such as Robert George of Princeton University) and Washington, D.C., think tank types (such as Fred Smith of the Competitive Enterprise Institute).
As such, it offers a fair window into the dementia of contemporary conservative thinking.
One amusing thing about the list is its seeming inability to distinguish between seminal works of social science and totalitarian manifestos.
Karl Marx, Adolf Hitler and Chairman Mao Tse tung sit alongside pragmatist philosopher John Dewey and sex researcher Alfred Kinsey.
You'll be comforted to know that Mao, with 38 points and a No. 3 ranking, edged out Kinsey, with 37 points.
"The Feminine Mystique," meanwhile, checks in at No. 7, with 30 points, just behind "Das Kapital," which totaled 31 points.
Harmful books that got honorable mentions but couldn't crack the top 10 include John Stuart Mill's "On Liberty," Sigmund Freud's "Introduction to Psychoanalysis" and Charles Darwin's "The Descent of Man."
Oh yes, and Lenin's "What Is to Be Done."
(If you don't see the link among arguing for individual rights, exploring scientific mysteries and constructing a brutally repressive Bolshevik terror state, then clearly you're not thinking like a conservative.)
Interestingly, "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion," a czarist forgery that incited countless massacres and inspires anti Semites around the world to this day, failed to rate a mention.
But "Unsafe at Any Speed" and "Silent Spring," which led to such horrors as seat belts and the Clean Water Act, did.
(Given that "Unsafe at Any Speed" launched the career of Ralph Nader, who went on to put George W. Bush in the White House, I wonder if conservatives might one day deem it one of the most helpful books of the last two centuries.)
Possibly even more amusing are the explanations for each book's inclusion.
They read like 10th grade book reports from some right wing, bizarro world high school.
John Maynard Keynes' seminal "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money" argued that during recessions governments should cut interest rates, reduce taxes and increase spending, and during expansions do the opposite.
It makes the list because, Human Events explains, "FDR adopted the idea as U.S. policy, and the U.S. government now has a $2.6 trillion annual budget and an $8 trillion debt."
(But didn't Keynesian policies help win World War II and then produce 25 years of phenomenal prosperity?
And wasn't that debt less than $1 trillion before Reagan took office?)
The squib on "The Feminine Mystique" begins with a fairly anodyne summary of Betty Freidan's pioneering feminist tract.
Rather than explain what's so dangerous about allowing women the choice of having a career, though, Human Events proceeds to quote a review that "Friedan was from her college days, and until her mid 30s, a Stalinist Marxist."
Not just a Stalinist, but a Marxist to boot!
Personally, I fail to see how Friedan's communist past she was 42 when she published "The Feminine Mystique" would discredit her insights about the repressive nature of a world in which women were discriminated against or barred outright from most professions and much of public life.
Especially because the conservative movement was itself heavily salted with ex communists.
But then, my mind has already been poisoned by Dewey, Mill and other liberal relativists.
When Judith Warner was researching her book "Perfect Madness," a sharply observed study of motherhood in today's culture, the TV series "Desperate Housewives" was not yet part of the zeitgeist.
But the book and the TV soap sing an almost perfect duet of disharmony together, each from a distinct point of view.
The TV character most stay at home moms identify with is Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman), the frazzled mother who gave up her career to raise an unmanageable brood, and who feels she can never quite catch up to her life.
And that feeling is one of the threads that run through "Madness," which has ridden a surge of media attention (a Newsweek cover story, two big pops on the "Today" show with Katie Couric) to debut at No. 9 on The New York Times Bestseller List.
"There's a widespread feeling in the culture now that things have gone too far, that there's this insanity, and I think Lynette and my book both tap that feeling," Warner says.
But where the jolts of recognition in "Housewives" are embedded in silliness, "Perfect Madness" is perfectly serious, a book that strives to be an updated take on Betty Friedan's groundbreaking "The Feminine Mystique."
Friedan wrote about "The Problem That Has No Name" (but which had much to do with being desperate and a housewife), and Warner is concerned about "The New Problem That Has No Name," which bundles together many things, including motherhood, perfectionism and guilt.
"That caught by the throat feeling so many mothers have today of always doing something wrong," she calls it.
Warner has received a lot of response from mothers about "Madness."
"I hear the positive feedback, 'cause that's what they'll tell me to my face," she says.
But she also has read some of the Web log responses, which cover a wide range.
One blogger accused her of being a sniper in the "Mommy Wars" mothers criticizing other mothers for staying home, for working in an office, for using or not using day care, for being too involved or not involved enough.
Warner disagrees.
"This is not mommy bashing," Warner says of the book.
Warner, the mother of daughters ages 4 and 7, was a Newsweek correspondent based in Paris, where she saw much more support for young mothers.
When she moved back to Washington, she was appalled by the parents who camped out in line to get their children into the right preschool, who medicated their children for the tiniest reason and who obsessively bought every Baby Einstein and Baby Mozart product that came out.
"A generation of control freaks" she calls them in the book.
She is both one of them herself, she acknowledges, and an observer, apart.
An example, she says, is occupational therapy for preschoolers.
"I don't know about the rest of the country," she said, "but in New York and Washington, D.C., tons and tons of kids are in OT to work on their fine motor skills.
You have schools where practically every 4 year old boy is in OT to improve his handwriting and scissor skills.
Anyone with a grain of common sense knows this is excessive."
The overall tone of "Madness" is sympathetic to moms.
But Warner can be critical of "hyperparenting," and she finds plenty of other groups to criticize for the mom madness, including: The media.
Especially magazines that seem obsessed with chronicling what some call "the work life balance" articles that Warner says can make mothers feel inadequate.
"Nearly every story comes with a message: You can take control," she writes.
Husbands, for obvious reasons.
She recounts excerpts from the interviews she conducted with several hundred women.
The anger and frustration over how little men help with child rearing comes pouring out.
"I have learned that I am basically going it alone," one woman tells her sounding exactly like Lynette.
Advocates of all stripes.
"The culture wars between social conservatives and feminists, which take place far from the concerns of most Americans," she writes, "are a huge and terrible waste of resources.
They have left women holding the bag, with virtually nothing to show for themselves, after three decades of women's 'liberation' and of New Right 'family values' activism."
Society.
"It's really your country and not your child, not your family, not yourself that is entirely out of control," she writes.
She argues for a nonpartisan agenda of social changes that would include affordable and high quality day care, health care for part time workers and their families, and incentives for businesses with pro family policies, saying most of that could be accomplished with changes in the tax laws.
"I kept the political part of it really short, to about a chapter," she says, "but I've been shocked by the extent people are interested in the policy implications."
"We need to start looking critically at family dynamics the stress, the perpetual motion, the anxiety.
My critique is primarily aimed at society, not at mothers."

Betty Friedan, who championed the once radical assertion that women needed more than husbands and children to find fulfillment, was eulogized Monday as a feminist pioneer and loving mother if not always an easy one to live with.
"I truly believe that Betty Friedan was the most influential woman, not only of the 20th century but of the second millennium," said Muriel Fox, one of the co founders with Friedan of the National Organization for Women.
Colleagues from the American women's movement as well as her three children and their families were among more than 300 mourners at the funeral for Friedan, who died of congestive heart failure Saturday on her 85th birthday.
Friedan's son Jonathan remembered his mother hard at work writing "The Feminine Mystique" the 1963 manifesto that shattered the cozy family ideal of the prosperous postwar era while her three children bounced around their New York City apartment.
"Betty was not the perfect mother," he said.
"Emily, Daniel and I ate TV dinners growing up way beyond the recommended limit."
But when tens of thousands of people cheered his mother at a rally when he was 17, "my heart, despite its adolescent shell, burst with pride."
Friedan's daughter, Dr Emily Friedan, called her mother "a mass of contradictions."
"She made so many connections and yet was exquisitely lonely," she said.
"Maybe the ultimate contradiction was that Betty just didn't fit into this world.
That was her curse, and yet she started a revolution."
Former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman said she struggled to keep up with Friedan at women's rights marches because Friedan "had enough energy for all of us."
"Betty liberated our minds, and the gift of freedom is one of the most important things that we can have," Holtzman said.
Several speakers remembered Friedan as a loving person who could also be feisty and difficult.
"She was always very sweet and loving to me but when it came to other people she just didn't take any (expletive) from anyone," said her 23 year old grandson, Raphael Friedan.
"She was definitely the coolest grandmother that a young guy like me could ask for."
He recalled how his grandmother took him to Cuba and let him throw big parties at her summer house in Sag Harbor on Long Island, near New York City.
Six of Friedan's nine grandchildren accompanied her plain wooden coffin out of Riverside Memorial Chapel in Manhattan after the service.
She was to be buried in Sag Harbor.
Cox News Service DAYTON, Ohio In 1962, when she was six months' pregnant with her first child, Judy Mott was laid off from her job with Sears.
"It's against store policy," her bosses told her curtly.
customers.
With her husband in college, Mott was the family's primary breadwinner.
But she knew it wouldn't do any good to protest.
She couldn't have known she was only a year away from an event that would change everything: The publication of Betty Friedan's "The Feminine Mystique."
Mott wondered if today's young women even know of Friedan's existence, let alone what a difference she made in their lives.
Last year, her granddaughter, Jennifer Mott, a junior at Centerville High School, wrote an insightful essay about Friedan's importance to the feminist movement.
"It blew me away," said Mott, community development manager for Montgomery County.
Adds Jennifer: "I wouldn't have the choices that I have today if it weren't for the courage of women like Betty Friedan."
The New York Times concurred in its front page article Monday about Friedan's death at 85, noting that her "searing first book, "The Feminine Mystique," ignited the contemporary women's movement in 1963 and as a result permanently transformed the social fabric of the United States and countries around the world."
For a woman who created such a dramatic change in our society, Friedan's death caused remarkably little stir.
I winced at the news reports that misspelled her last name as "Freidan."
Jennifer Mott acknowledges that few of her peers have heard of Friedan.
"When I was doing my paper it really stuck out to me that she's one of the reasons I can have goals, go to college, and major in something meaningful to me," she said.
"She grew up at a time when it was considered the natural goal for women to be a wife and drive the kids to Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts and not to have any underlying desires.
She respected motherhood, but wanted women to know it was OK to want something more."
Why was her death accorded little of the reverence shown this week at the passing of another giant, Coretta Scott King?
A partial explanation is that feminism remains a movement that gets little respect.
It's more likely the butt of a joke or a Rush Limbaugh rant about "feminazis."
Sometimes people will tell you they believe in equal rights for women but hasten to add, "I'm not a feminist," as if there's no correlation between the two concepts.
But part of the reason for Friedan's relative obscurity is the very success of her movement.
"In later years," The Times article noted, "some feminists dismissed Ms Friedan's work as outmoded."
It's hard to imagine, today, a world in which companies routinely fired women for being pregnant.
Jennifer Mott had never heard the story about how her grandmother lost her job at Sears when she was pregnant with Jennifer's father, Norb Mott.
But she'll never forget her grandmother's constant words of encouragement: "You can do anything you want to do."
It's a lesson she learned from Betty Friedan.

ON FRIEDAN, A FEMINIST CRITIQUE (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In The Guardian, Germaine Greer took critical measure of a fellow feminist, Betty Friedan, the author of "The Feminine Mystique," who died on Feb 4 at 85.
(END ITALICS HERE) In its time, "The Feminine Mystique" was a book that spoke to American women loud and clear.
It was based on a questionnaire Betty sent out to the women who were at college with her in the 1950s, all "happily" married and bringing up kids in the suburbs.
Betty, who was in the same boat, was feeling restless and dissatisfied.
To her immense relief and considerable surprise, she found that just about all the women in the same situation who replied to her questionnaire were feeling the same.
Betty was not one to realize that she was being lifted on an existing wave, she thought she was the wave, that she had actually created the Zeitgeist that was ready and hungry for her book.
PANNING FOR TERRORISTS (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In "Of Wiretaps, Google Searches and Handguns," on ABCNews.com, the mathematician John Allen Paulos took a statistical look at government electronic surveillance, arguing that widespread wiretapping programs produce so much information that it is essentially impossible to follow up on the leads generated.
(END ITALICS HERE) Even if an accurate profile of potential terrorists is drawn, the fact that such a vanishingly small percentage of us are terrorists means that the vast majority of the people investigated will be innocent.
Even if the probability that the purported terrorist profile is accurate were an astonishing 99 percent (if someone has terrorist ties, the profile will pick him or her out 99 percent of the time, and, for ease of computation, if someone does not have such ties, the profile will pick him or her out only 1 percent of the time), most of the hits would be false positives.
For illustration, let's further assume that one out of a million American residents has terrorist ties that's approximately 300 people and the profile will pick out 99 percent, or 297 of them.
Great.
But what of the approximately 300 million innocent Americans?
The profile will also pick out 1 percent of them, "only" 3 million.
YOUR BRAIN ON SUPER BOWL ADS (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Edge.com has an article titled "Who Really Won the Super Bowl?" by Dr Marco Iacoboni, a neuroscientist at the UCLA Ahmanson Lovelace Brain Mapping Center.
Iacoboni and his colleagues used fast magnetic resonance imaging technology to observe brain responses to commercials shown during the Super Bowl.
(END ITALICS HERE) The overwhelming winner among the Super Bowl ads is the Disney NFL "I am going to Disney" ad.
The Disney ad elicited strong responses in orbito frontal cortex and ventral striatum, two brain regions associated with processing of rewards.
Also, the Disney ad induced robust responses in mirror neuron areas, indicating identification and empathy.
Further, the circuit for cognitive control, encompassing anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, was highly active while watching the Disney ad.
The three biggest flops seem to be the Burger King ad, the FedEx ad and the GoDaddy ad.
Three quite interesting features that come out of this instant study are the following: first, people when interviewed tend to say what they are expected to say, but their brain seems to say the opposite.
For instance, female subjects may give verbally very low "grades" to ads using actresses in sexy roles, but their mirror neuron areas seem to fire up quite a bit, suggesting some form of identification and empathy.
Second, we saw strong habituation effects, such that the second time around the commercial induces much weaker responses.
Third and this is probably interesting to neuroscientists among brain regions associated with complex social behavior, we observed a mix of activation and de activation.

Today should not pass without recalling the impact of Betty Friedan and the profound changes triggered by her incisive appeal for women to reject the "contented" homemaker role of the 1950s and insist on fuller participation in American life.
Anyone younger than 45 will find it hard to believe that scarcely a generation ago middle class women did not aspire to careers outside of teacher, nurse or secretary, that girls did not play school sports, that raising kids and pleasing men were considered to be a respectable woman's highest and only callings.
The second wave of American feminism surely would have happened without Friedan, who died over the weekend on her 85th birthday.
But her book "The Feminine Mystique" hit with explosive force in 1963 and quickened the women's movement.
Drawing from her own unhappy Midwestern childhood, Friedan gave voice to "a strange stirring, a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning that ,each suburban wife struggled with ,alone.
As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside her husband at night she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question 'Is this all?'
" Within two decades, the American culture and economy had been transformed.
The entry of women into the workforce affected nearly everything from fast food to freeway traffic, from marriage to home design, from education to the deepening divides in politics and religion over topics like abortion and "family values."
Although Friedan founded prominent women's rights organizations, led marches and was famously cantankerous, she was a moderate in the movement, once joking that it wasn't men that woman should reject, but vacuum cleaners.
Indeed, the mainstream values of nurture, home and familial love were the foundation of her authority: She believed that women should have equal rights, but not at the expense of alienating men.
Real love, she thought, could not happen among unequals.
For that she was dismissed as "bourgeois" and pushed to the margins.
In 1991 Susan Faludi accused her of "yanking out the stitches in her own handiwork."
But perhaps because Friedan did not overreach, her appeals to justice and common sense were more effective in transforming the lives and prospects of American women.
If you have a daughter, you should today whisper a silent thanks for Betty Friedan's life and work.
Betty Friedan had a thing about floor care.
Mopping the linoleum, scrubbing the bathroom tile, vacuuming a mere twice weekly this humdrum trope runs through "The Feminine Mystique" with the insistent drone of a "new electric waxer over the spotless kitchen floor."
The relentless but unsatisfying demands of the crumb free floor encapsulated Friedan's famous "problem that has no name," the unspoken sense of dissatisfaction churning in the kitchens of America and the minds of American women in the mid 20th century.
As Friedan summed it up, "What kind of woman was she if she did not feel this mysterious fulfillment waxing the kitchen floor?"
To which, on picking up "The Feminine Mystique" four decades later, my initial response was: You're supposed to wax the floor?
I write this not to belittle Friedan's metaphor but rather to revel in its obsolescence.
For to reread the "The Feminine Mystique," as I did after Friedan's death last weekend, is to be reminded of the transformation of American women indeed, American society in the 43 years since the publication of her then shocking manifesto.
There have been remarkable advances, and not just in the technology of no wax floors.
This change the long way that women have, in fact, come is easy to forget, in part because we are still picking our way unsteadily along the path that Friedan helped cut, still enmeshed in work vs. family debates that are at once stale and impassioned.
Women at least those with the luxury of choice agonize endlessly over part time vs. full time vs. staying at home, whatever option we select, we tend to second guess the decision.
We search for the elusive holy grail of work life balance off ramps and on ramps and flextime and job sharing.
We alternate between acceptance and despair at the still inequitable allocation of family tasks.
We have a seat, more often, at the table, but are surprised, too often, to look up and find no other women there.
We choose the mommy track but lament the glass ceiling.
All of which is to say: The role of women in the America of 2006 is complicated and messy and not apt to be resolved anytime soon, if at all.
The more pertinent question, though, is: Compared to what?
I can argue that the glass now is half empty or half full, and I've done both, depending mostly on how smoothly things are running in our chaotic, grimy floored household.
But reentering the world of "The Feminine Mystique" is an oddly comforting exercise in time travel.
In the long gone world depicted by Friedan, the life of the American woman is a cruelly binary one: The women she describes feel forced to choose between work and home, their failure to be fully contented with the latter is taken as evidence of neurosis, or worse.
"Each suburban wife struggled with it alone," Friedan writes in her opening paragraph.
"As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside her husband at night she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question 'Is this all?'
" And there is no contrary role model.
"I never knew a woman, when I was growing up," Friedan writes, "who used her mind, played her own part in the world, and also loved, and had children."
Friedan's diagnosis is characteristically, even offensively, overblown: She compares housewives resigned to their suburban imprisonment to inmates in "their comfortable concentration camps."
The feminine mystique, she says, "has succeeded in burying millions of American women alive."
Yet her prescription for these women is remarkably un strident, even balanced.
"Marriage and motherhood are an essential part of life, but not the whole of it," she writes.
Women "need to create a new life plan, fitting in the love and children and home that have defined femininity in the past with the work toward a greater purpose that shapes the future."
Friedan understood, as many of her more radical successors did not, that work without family could feel as empty as the converse.
I remember, not so long after "The Feminine Mystique" was published and before, probably, I had even a bra to burn announcing definitively to my mother that I would not be having children.
My intention, I'm sure, was mostly to shock her, I suspected even then that my preteen certitude might not last.
But my declaration derived in part from the prevailing mind set that family was merely an annoying impediment to anyone who wanted to do Serious Work.
Now that I am, thankfully, the mother I vowed I would never be, I watch my children two daughters and wonder how they will manage these tensions.
And I find myself these days feeling oddly hopeful.
At dinner the other day, my fifth grader eagerly described the bottle rocket she was making in science class.
As it happened, her group of three was all girls, one's mother a research scientist, the other's a partner in a major law firm.
They had decorated their rocket, my daughter said, with neon pink duct tape and named it "Feminism."
Somehow, I think, Betty Friedan would have been pleased.
History is a terrible thing to waste.
The obituaries for Betty Friedan, whose 1963 book, "The Feminine Mystique," revived an American feminism then thought to be extinct and unnecessary, were striking in their recognition of how much explanation is now required about the world before the women's movement.
Newspapers had to remind their readers that equal pay for equal work, sex blind help wanted ads, the right of pregnant women to keep their jobs, nondiscriminatory admission standards for professional schools and many other matters of simple justice were considered not only controversial but radical proposals in the 1960s.
Younger readers were doubtless as incredulous at this news as my 23 year old and 15 year old nieces were when I recently told them about the essay I was required to write by The Washington Post's personnel department as part of my application for a reporting job in 1965.
The topic, singularly inappropriate for a childless 19 year old, was, "How I Plan to Combine Motherhood With a Career."
On one level, the ignorance of the young and the not so young many people in their 40s also know little about what life was like when most forms of discrimination against women were perfectly legal is a measure of how much has been accomplished.
But on a deeper level, this ignorance endangers many feminist gains because it raises the real possibility that future generations will have to reinvent the wheel.
It has happened before.
The first wave of American feminism, which began in 1848 with the Seneca Falls convention under the leadership of Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was concerned with much more than obtaining the vote for women.
Economic equality, educational equality and most controversial of all equality in religious institutions that had long preached the divinely ordained inferiority of women were part of the first feminist platform.
As the century wore on, though, the more radical voices were stilled and the movement concentrated solely on suffrage.
Stanton, whose "The Woman's Bible" created as much of a sensation and a scandal in 1892 as Friedan's book did 71 years later, was written out (literally) of the women's movement because of her unorthodox views on religion.
Her name did not return to history until the 1980s, with the research of a new generation of feminist scholars.
Friedan was the first 20th century feminist to restore the historical and cultural context lost for most of the century and to make the essential point that, if an entire group has a problem, the solution can never be purely personal.
I have always been grateful that I read "The Feminine Mystique" shortly before I went to Washington to interview with the Post.
Before reading Friedan, I truly believed that barriers to women in journalism would not apply to me because all of those other women must have done something wrong to be stuck in what used to be called the "society section."
Without the perspective provided by Friedan, I might have been surprised by the personnel director's insulting demand, lost my temper and lost the chance at a job.
As it was, I bit my tongue, wrote the essay and told myself that I would become one of the women who would challenge the prejudices that denigrated all women.
Friedan's message about the cultural nature of women's subordination was not well received initially.
In the New York Times Book Review in 1963, Lucy Freeman scolded Friedan for criticizing women's magazines and asked, "What is to stop a woman who is interested in national and international affairs from reading magazines that deal with those subjects?
To paraphrase a famous line, 'The fault, dear Mrs Friedan, is not in our culture, but in ourselves.'
" At Freidan's funeral in New York on Monday, her longtime friend, sociologist Amitai Etzioni, noted that his department at Columbia University did not have a single female professor in 1962.
The few Barnard female students admitted to Columbia classes, Etzioni acknowledged honestly, knew that they were there on sufferance and "knew that they should not be heard too often."
This entire history is in urgent need of retelling today, at a time when other legacies of the movement most notably legal abortion are under assault.
Historical amnesia, not the fundamentalist Christian right, is the true villain.
Millions of young women and men today simply cannot imagine what life was like before Roe vs. Wade any more than they can imagine what it was like to be told "No Women Need Apply" at the door to graduate school classrooms.
The obligation to retell the truth belongs to my generation, young enough to have reaped the benefits of the revolution begun by women now in their 70s and 80s.
It is our moral duty to ensure that the history of our women's movement, unlike the history of 19th century feminism, does not perish from the consciousness of the next generation.
It is still difficult for Taiwanese women to strike a balance between their family lives and careers, the leaders of various Taiwanese women's groups said Tuesday.
Paying tribute to the late pioneer of the modern U.S. feminist movement Betty Friedan, who died Feb 4, the leaders said Friedan's ideals have had substantial impact on the women's movement in Taiwan, but it is still difficult to implement Friedan's later aspiration to have women succeed with both family lives and careers.
"Betty Friedan's most important heritage is her facilitation of women's employment.
However, the percentage of Taiwanese women in employment is still low, even though the present 48 percent is a record high, " PWR Foundation Chairwoman Liu Yu hsiu said.
The PWR Foundation is Taiwan's leading women's group for promoting the employment of women.
"But U.S. liberal feminists like Friedan completely ignored the childcare issue, assuming childcare to be the responsibility of the private individual.
Taiwan also follows this model, and that makes it difficult for mothers to seek employment," Liu added.
Liu said that to encourage mothers to remain in employment, it is important that the government should provide comprehensive public and affordable daycare service.
DPP Legislator at large Huang Sue ying, also a leading women's rights advocate, supported Liu's claim.
"One major hurdle for mothers seeking jobs is the childcare issue.
Whether the government provides a daycare support mechanism for mothers at work is a decisive factor," Huang said.
"Another major hurdle is certain groups' attempts to make mothers feel guilty about leaving their babies.
They have created the mystique that babies have to be cared for by their mothers, " she claimed.
Huang pointed out that according to the latest Council of Labor Affairs figures, 67 percent of children under the age of three are cared for personally by their mothers, while over 20 percent are raised by relatives and only about 10 percent are put into daycare services.
She said this shows the inadequacy of daycare services in Taiwan and claimed that consequently, mothers are not confident enough in these centers to leave their babies there.
Garden of Hope Foundation CEO Chi Hui jung said that even in her own organization, some female employees still choose to quit their jobs and devote themselves completely to their children.
The foundation is Taiwan's leading women's group focusing on the problems of adolescent girls.
"They would rather choose to spend all their time with their children.
Even if they want to work, they want something that is part time and close to their homes," Chi said.
"It is probably because Taiwanese couples are giving birth to fewer children that mothers are willing to invest as much resources and time as possible in their little ones," she added.
Chi said some other female employees may decide to take leave of absence to look after their babies for a year or two.
Although the foundation grants the leave, it offers no guarantee that their jobs will still be there when the employees want to return.
There are also incidences of female employees refusing promotions for fear of work consuming too much of their family time, Chi said.
"Although women can have day jobs now, they are still not relieved of their family duties.
Wives still spend more time doing housework than their husbands.
What I see is that women often pay a higher price than their husbands to keep their jobs, " Chi said.
Those of us who came of age with the feminist movement wanted to be a Gloria Steinem kind of feminist.
Not a Betty Friedan kind of feminist.
We were not the restless suburban housewives for whom the frumpy, doughy Friedan spoke.
We were not the woman who suffered "a nameless, aching dissatisfaction" with her life of chores and children.
Instead, we were young careerists like the sleek and husky voiced Steinem, who had the physical qualifications to make her journalistic mark in a Playboy bunny costume.
We believed Steinem when she said, "A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle."
Friedan was trying to make peace with that bicycle for the sake of the kids.
We didn't think we'd ever have any.
It was that generational split between our mothers, for whom Friedan spoke, and ourselves, who wanted to emulate Steinem's androgynous independence that cost Friedan her rightful place at the head of the table of the feminist movement.
Only now, at her death Saturday at 85, do we acknowledge what she meant to all of us.
Friedan was that housewife, bored near to madness after giving up her career some accounts say she was fired when she got pregnant a second time to stay at home and take care of the household while her husband worked.
But she didn't have words for the frustration she felt until she surveyed her fellow Smith College graduates in advance of a reunion and found that the ones at home with the kids were feeling the same ennui.
Steinem might have called that networking.
"The Feminine Mystique," the book that resulted from that survey and many more confirming interviews with wives and mothers, was not the shot heard 'round the world that legend would have us believe.
Published in 1963 in only modest numbers, it did not hit the heart of the American home until it came out as a Dell paperback a year later.
I have this vision of stay at home mothers passing this dog eared paperback around the playground, the pool and the schoolyard until a revolution quietly bubbled up from a million "a ha" moments.
Friedan described the vague dissatisfaction of these women while the feminists that followed radicalized the remedy.
Friedan's first cause was the unification of the help wanted ads, which had been separated by gender.
By the time we college women got hold of the feminist movement, we assumed we would work at any job we wanted.
Men and children, optional.
"Some people think I'm saying 'Women of the world unite you have nothing to lose but your men,' " Friedan told Life magazine in 1963.
"It's not true.
You have nothing to lose but your vacuum cleaners."
The irony, of course, is that 30 years later many of Steinem's acolytes are the reincarnation of Friedan's mad housewife.
Somewhere along the line, we got married and we had kids and we patched together some compromise between work and home that our husbands never had to make.
We are half nuts, too.
But this time our problem has a name.
It is called "having it all."
It seems like only a moment ago that we sat in consciousness raising groups, drafting the script for a new world order that would have no gender boundaries.
But it was a script without a back story.
We never called home to ask how our mothers had managed.
We didn't think they had anything to teach us.
We just repudiated their choices with our own.
The feminist movement would split over the issues in the kind of degrading internecine war that diminishes all movements, and Friedan was kicked to the curb.
She resigned as the first president of the National Organization for Women just a few years after founding it on a cocktail napkin.
Younger feminists thought she had paid too much attention to the concerns of white, middle class married women instead of to those of minorities, poor women and lesbians.
It is Friedan's mixed legacy that the issues that mattered most to her are still on the table today: paid maternity leave, affordable child care, job training for women with children, reproductive self determination.
The issues that the college feminists dismissed as bourgeois are the issues that continue to matter most to women today.
It took us all these years to realize that Friedan was more than the mother of the movement.
She was the mother of us all.
Betty Friedan, rest in peace.
You helped spark a revolution of thought that galvanized a nation of women to reject the 1950s cookie cutter lifestyle that revolved around being wife, mother, housekeeper and cook.
It's hard to imagine women living a prefabricated life, tucked amid cul de sacs in mass produced homes in leafy suburbs the kind of lifestyle you railed against.
The woman who headed my family then never knew such a world.
While middle and upper middle class women, most of them white, related to "The Feminine Mystique" Friedan's 1963 critique of domesticity my mom was struggling to save her marriage while working as a seamstress and raising two children.
No. 3 (me) came along later.
Six years after I was born, Mom and Dad divorced, meaning she was not only mom, cook, housekeeper and breadwinner, she'd also take up the slack as dad.
This was the reality of single mothers in my 'hood, who didn't have the luxury of time to fret about a life interrupted.
They gladly would have traded places with educated women of privilege who felt trapped in their suburban world.
Women of my generation only know what we've read about those changing times and what our moms have told us.
Back then, my mom was encouraged to go to "secretarial school" while women like Friedan graduated from elite colleges only to be ushered to a life serving her husband and children.
Which is worse: having little hope, or having hopes raised, then crushed?
Even though poor women of my mother's generation could not relate to women like Friedan, they would benefit from the trickle down effect the women's movement had.
Taking college courses at night, my mom earned a bachelor's degree in the early '80s.
Professors encouraged her to pursue a master's degree.
Friedan, who died Saturday at age 85, helped empower women to fight for parity with men: equal jobs, equal pay and equal respect.
Those heading the movement did not clamor for poor women to have access to college grants, job training and day care.
Though most single mothers living in poverty didn't directly benefit from the women's movement, many of their daughters have.
That is, if they had a combination of strong mentors, luck and will.
The gains for women overall have been tremendous, and it happened because women like Friedan were stoking the flames of action, getting women organized and demanding change.
Still, we have a long way to go, baby.
There are eight female CEOs heading up Fortune 500 companies.
Women own fewer than 30 percent of nonfarm businesses in the U.S., according to a January report by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Yet, women owned businesses are growing at twice the rate of the national average.
Women account for 20 percent of college presidents.
Yet, at 56 percent of the college undergraduate population, women outnumber men in college.
Our societal views have changed too.
Most men don't expect to marry a woman who will stay home and play the role of housekeeper, mother and cook not that there's anything wrong with it if it's the woman's choice.
Over lunch last week, an acquaintance told me she and her husband didn't plan to have children.
Just like that.
No whispering.
No guilt.
That's the gift Friedan gave women.
Our worth isn't determined by our marital status.
Divorced women are no longer viewed as used goods.
Single women who have passed age 35 are no longer spinsters.
It's freeing.
But there are some things that are hard to liberate ourselves of: Middle class single women may be independent and career minded, but they still have to do their own laundry.

Public enemy No. 1 for most Americans is Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the Sept 11, 2001, attacks who continues to threaten more deadly strikes against the United States.
In close competition for that dubious title should be Abdul Qadeer Khan, 68, also known as A.Q. Khan, the Pakistani nuclear scientist who oversaw the spread of nuclear weapons to U.S. adversaries, possibly including al Qaida, bin Laden's terrorist group.
Khan arguably has done more to undermine U.S. security than bin Laden.
He has confessed to transferring nuclear weapons know how to Iran, Libya and North Korea.
U.S. officials and investigators at the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency are still searching for other possible customers who possess Khan's digitized blueprints for nuclear specific manufacturing equipment and how to manuals for running uranium enrichment centrifuges, much of it on handy compact disks.
Since the invention of nuclear weapons 60 years ago, no one has done more to spread those weapons to more countries than Khan.
The Khan network of suppliers, middlemen and front companies flourished across 30 countries.
He was a for profit nuclear proliferator, with a one stop atomic emporium that allowed shoppers to buy bomb designs, centrifuges for enriching uranium from uranium hexafluoride, and consulting services to help get weapons plants up and running.
"At least as dangerous as Osama bin Laden" former CIA Director George Tenet.
"A very serious proliferatorvery dangerous to the world" Secretary of State Colin Powell.
Khan's nuclear smuggling network is "mind boggling" and "beyond anyone's imagination" Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
"A monstrous creature" Rep Tom Lantos, D Calif., top Democrat on the House Foreign Relations Committee.
Khan "has poured kerosene on the nuclear proliferation embers."
Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Washington, D.C. "He did huge damage" to U.S. security Graham Allison, former assistant secretary of defense and author of "Nuclear Terrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe."
Khan is "an evil genius, a Dr Strangelove" Robert Oakley, former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan.
Despite his notoriety, A. Q. Khan has escaped the "most wanted" label applied to bin Laden because of a delicate diplomatic and political minuet linking Khan, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and President Bush.
Each man for his own reasons has thrown a cloak of silence over what is emerging as the biggest nuclear scandal in history.
In contrast to the missing bin Laden target of a global manhunt Khan's whereabouts are well known.
He is living under house arrest in a tony section of Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, as part of a deal that Musharraf unveiled last year.
That deal gave Khan a full pardon and allowed him to keep the millions of dollars he is believed to have netted from the illicit sales.
In exchange, Khan took responsibility for the crimes and agreed to the house arrest a punishment that forced Khan, a high profile and beloved figure in Pakistan, to vanish from public life and scientific endeavor.
A U.S. alert to Musharraf apparently triggered Khan's confession.
According to Secretary of State Colin Powell, the United States by early 2004 had amassed so much evidence that Khan was peddling nuclear secrets that Powell telephoned Musharraf and told him to "deal with" Khan.
"I said to him, "We know so much about this that we're going to go public with it, and within a few weeks, okay?
And you need to deal with this before you have to deal with it publicly."'
The next step came on Feb 4 when, in a dramatic televised speech, Khan confessed and without naming the countries that had received his services accepted "full responsibility" for exporting nuclear technology.
"My dear brothers and sisters, I have chosen to appear before you to offer my deepest regrets and unqualified apologies," he said, speaking in English.
The nuclear proliferation, he said, was "initiated at my behest."
"I was confronted with the evidence and the findings, and I have voluntarily admitted that much of it is true and accurate," he said.
He was quick to absolve the Musharraf government of any involvement.
While some of his colleagues at the A.Q. Khan Research Laboratories Pakistan's top nuclear facility are also under investigation for trafficking, "There was never any kind of authorization for these activities by the government," he said.
The next day, it was Musharraf's turn to appear before the TV cameras.
Dressed in an Army jacket, khaki trousers and combat boots, the Pakistani leader announced at a news conference that he had pardoned Khan for spreading the potential for nuclear terror.
The Pakistani president signed off by telling how much he admired the scientist.
"All the proliferation, unfortunately, was under the supervision or orders of Dr A.Q. Khan," Musharraf told a news conference, quickly adding that Khan is "still my hero" for developing atomic weapons for Pakistan.
"Dr A.Q. Khan has made Pakistan a nuclear power," said Musharraf.
"I want to protect his honor."
Musharraf insisted that the Pakistani government had no knowledge of Khan's extensive proliferation network because the scientist had amassed enormous autonomy during the previous two decades as he developed nuclear weapons for Pakistan.
The general accused the governments of Libya and Iran of ratting on Khan to the IAEA.
"Muslim brothers did not ask us before giving our names," Musharraf complained.
Khan has been under house arrest since.
Musharraf's eagerness to whisk the matter out of sight reflects a harsh political fact of life for the 61 year old general.
Khan is a hero in Pakistan and throughout the Islamic world for perfecting his country's first nuclear weapon and, by definition, the much anticipated first "Muslim bomb."
Pakistan exploded a series of atomic bombs in 1998, bringing that country into nuclear parity with archrival India, with whom it has fought three wars.
Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to Sri Lanka and adviser to prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto, says Khan is so popular in Pakistan that if he announced he wanted his countrymen to give him money, "150 million Pakistanis would give it to him.
Pakistani kids would empty their pockets for him."
Haqqani teaches international relations at Boston University and is author of the forthcoming book, "Pakistan between Mosque and Military."
Musharraf presides over a nation festering with Islamic militants, with large segments of the population sympathetic to al Qaida and remnants of the fundamentalist Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which the U.S. military toppled three years ago.
The general is in no position to get tough with Khan by, for example, putting him on trial, especially since such a step would appear to be catering to the United States, which is widely unpopular throughout the country.
Pakistan's religious parties already are angry with Musharraf for placing Khan along with at least a half dozen of his associates under house arrest.
Musharraf won't let U.S. investigators or officials from the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency question Khan directly ("It's a matter of national pride" he says) to find out more about his far flung proliferation network.
From the Pakistani dictator's point of view, the least said about Khan, the better.
The Pakistani leader, who has narrowly escaped two assassination attempts, keeps one eye nervously focused at all times on how Islamic militants in his nation react to his policies, especially when they involve coordination with the United States.
And there is a huge amount of coordination.
Powell said he speaks with Musharraf more than with any other foreign leader.
"We talk all the time," Powell said of the estimated 90 conversations he said they have had.
The Bush administration is also tiptoeing around the Khan case.
Because Musharraf is a key ally in the U.S. war against terrorism after the Sept 11 strikes he agreed to withdraw support for the Taliban, a regime that had supported al Qaida the Bush administration doesn't want to add to Musharraf's precarious domestic circumstances by pushing too hard to gain access to Khan.
Another reason the Bush administration is eager to let the Khan case gently disappear is that it represents a failure of American intelligence and diplomacy that one man the leading nuclear scientist of a U.S. ally could do so much damage for so long and escape detection.
The U.S. silent treatment for Khan also spares the administration from embarrassing comparisons with another intelligence failure the flawed prediction that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, the administration's stated reason for invading that country.
In the one case, U.S. intelligence flunked with its "slam dunk" certainty that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.
In the other case, U.S. intelligence failed to detect the massive nuclear proliferation program based in Pakistan, an American ally.
Khan did much, much more to foster the spread of nuclear weapons than Saddam Hussein ever did.
In their eagerness to downplay the Khan case, American officials have tried to make it sound like ancient history.
For example, during last fall's election campaign, President Bush declared that Khan's nuclear network "has been brought to justice."
Similarly, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld asserted that Khan's operations have been "rolled upThe network is gone."
Condoleezza Rice, Bush's former national security adviser and secretary of state designate, called Khan's house arrest a sufficient penalty that matched the crime.
"A.Q. Khan, in a sense, has been brought to justice because he is out of the business that he loved most," she said.But the IAEA is not as cheery.
"While we believe we have identified the major players and suppliers, we have not yet satisfied ourselves that we have got all of the subcontractors.
Nor have we accounted for all the material that was produced for the network.
Begging the question, where is it?" said Mark Gwozdecky, the IAEA spokeman.
The State Department's Bureau of Non Proliferation, the lead U.S. agency for preventing the global spread of weapons of mass destruction, has declined to discuss the Khan case.
"They just feel it's too sensitive and that there is nothing new they feel they can say," said Jim Kelman, a State Department spokesman.
Born in Bhopal, India in 1936, A. Q. Kahn and his family migrated to Pakistan in 1952 five years after the country was formed in a bloody partition with India.
Khan came from modest means his father was a teacher but stressed the value of education as a way to rise above the crippling poverty that pervades much of Pakistan.
Like many Pakistanis of his generation, Khan's worldview was shaped by Pakistan's opening conflict with India during the partition.
In a 2001 interview, Khan said that when he was a youth in the late 1940s, during the height of the partition conflict, he recalled train after train "full of dead Muslims" pulling into a local train station.
When Khan's family and thousands of other Muslims left India for Pakistan, Indian soldiers stripped them of their valuables, a loss of dignity that left a lasting impression on the youngster.
"I had been traveling with a pen that my brother gave me when I passed my exams, and just as I was crossing out of India, a border guard reached towards me and snatched it from my pocket," Khan said.
"The pen had almost no monetary value, but the guard's behavior hurt me, and it was something I'll never forget.
"Khan trained as an engineer at the University of Karachi, where he obtained his bachelors of science degree in 1960, and then obtained advanced metallurgical training in the then West Germany, Belgium and Holland.
In the 1970s, Khan worked in Europe for Urenco, a consortium funded by the British, Dutch and German governments that manufactured high speed centrifuges that produce enriched uranium U 235 by spinning uranium hexafluoride gas.
It's the U 235 that comprises uranium fueled atomic bombs.
Khan later stole centrifuge designs and fled to Pakistan in 1976 where he ran the country's nuclear program for the next 25 years.
In 1983 a Dutch court convicted him in absentia for stealing nuclear secrets and sentenced him to four years in prison, but the conviction was later overturned on a technicality.
Those secrets greatly advanced Pakistan's nuclear program that culminated in the 1998 atomic test explosions.
Khan received his nation's highest civilian honors for his contributions.
The scientist is something of a Renaissance man.
Married to a South African, he has westernized tastes, is fluent in English and Dutch, an animal lover who takes in stray dogs, raises peacocks and enjoys feeding wild monkeys.
He has a special fondness for Urdhu poetry and beautiful houses (he has owned properties in Pakistan, Mali and Dubai) and expensive cars.
A father of two, he is a self described " kindest person," who has funded charities and medical clinics for the poor in Pakistan.
Pakistanis who have met him describe Khan as passionate about public issues, always ready with an opinion on science, politics, religion and foreign affairs.
At times garrulous and gregarious, Khan is described as polite and witty.
"He is humble and not outwardly arrogant," said Hassan Abbas, a former Pakistani security official and author of " Pakistan's Drift into Extremism."
But in his infrequent interviews and public statements, Khan has revealed another side: He is a virulent Muslim nationalist with an Islamist's hatred of the United States, Israel and the West.
"All the western countries, including Israel, are not only Pakistan's enemies but also enemies of Islam," he charged in a 1984 interview.
He called the U.S. effort to prevent the flow of nuclear technology around the globe "part of the crusades which the Christians and Jews had initiated against the Muslims 1000 years ago."
Like many Muslims, Khan has spoken of a worldwide "Zionist" conspiracy to rob Muslim nations of their power and glory.
In a 2001 interview, Khan said the longstanding rumors about his work in nuclear proliferation were "unsubstantiated and fabricated lies" fomented by foreign governments "because I disturbed all their strategic plans, the balance of power and blackmailing potential in this part of the world" by building a nuclear arsenal for Pakistan.
"I am not a madman or a nut," he added.
U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies had long suspected Khan of running a vast nuclear proliferation enterprise and, according to Secretary of State Colin Powell, the Bush administration was "well aware of his activities" in 2001.
In a recent paid speech after he left his post as CIA director, George Tenet said the CIA's involvement in breaking up A. Q. Khan's proliferation operation dated to 1997.
"Working with British colleagues, we pieced together his subsidiaries, his clients, his front companies, his finances and manufacturing plants," Tenet said, according to an audiotape of the speech obtained by the New York Times.
"We were inside his residence, inside his facilities, inside his rooms.
We were everywhere these people were."
Tenet said the Khan operation stretched across three continents and called the bust "one of the greatest success stories nobody ever talks about."
As U.S. and British intelligence worked to uncover the Khan network, the U.N.'s Vienna based International Atomic Energy Agency proceeded on a parallel track.
By the spring of 2003, Iranian leaders had told IAEA officials about a black market where they had been buying nuclear material for the previous 18 years.
The Iranians claimed they were working through middlemen and were not aware of the identity of the suppliers, according to Mark Gwozdecky, the spokesman for IAEA.
Around the same time, the Americans and British reaped the benefits of the close surveillance of Khan's operations.
They were tracking the shipment of nuclear parts to Libya.
Italy intercepted once such shipment on a cargo ship in October 2003 that was carrying centrifuge parts.
Confronted with the evidence, and given Libya's desire to end longstanding economic sanctions, Tripoli confessed and renounced its nuclear program.
After Libya invited IAEA inspectors in December 2003, they uncovered a trove of incriminating evidence pointing to Khan.
"Libya helps fill in the blanks.
They were working directly with Khan and provided IAEA information about the actual supply chain," Gwozdecky said.
The IAEA believes Khan's network provided Libya with uranium hexafluoride, the raw material used in centrifuges to produce enriched uranium.
The network also provided the industrial help necessary for Libya to make its own uranium hexafluoride, as well as centrifuge and atomic bomb designs and machine shop equipment to service the centrifuges.
Much of this material has been dismantled in Libya and shipped to the United States where it is being studied at the Energy Department's Oak Ridge, Tenn., facilities.
Iran also received Khan's help on centrifuge technology, according to a CIA report to Congress.
And the CIA says Khan sold nuclear materials to North Korea.
At a minimum, Khan provided a turn key nuclear bomb program to Libya, while greatly speeding up the nuclear program of Iran, a country that sponsors terrorist organizations.
"Iran wouldn't be talking about getting nuclear weapons if it hadn't been for Khan," said David Albright, a leading nuclear expert and president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a non proliferation think tank.
Khan's centrifuge designs are particularly important to covert nuclear programs because they allow the development of bomb making material with greater secrecy, compared with the gaseous diffusion method of producing U 235.
"Centrifuge enrichment is much less energy and time consuming than gaseous diffusion, and you can hide it a lot easier," said Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Washington, D.C. U.S. intelligence and the U.N.'s Vienna based International Atomic Energy Agency are trying to determine whether A. Q. Khan or Iran, Libya or North Korea shared nuclear know how with third parties, like al Qaida.
The terrorist group has been pursuing atomic weapons and has said that it would use nuclear bombs against the United States.
Shortly after the Sept 11 attacks, Pakistan detained two of its nuclear scientists on suspicion that they shared nuclear information with Osama bin Laden, the al Qaida chief.
Although they were subsequently released, the CIA now believes that one of the scientists "may have provided some assistance to al Qaida's program" to acquire nuclear weaponry, the spy agency said in the recent report to Congress.
Based on documents recovered in Afghanistan, the agency described al Qaida's atomic efforts "rudimentary nuclear research, although the extent of its indigenous program is unclear."
Investigators are also trying to determine the extent of the Khan network and all of the companies around the globe that may have played a part.
There are at least 30 companies in 30 countries "all over the globe involved in this fantastic, sophisticated, illicit trafficking network with Mr A.Q. Khan acting as CEO," according to Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, chief of the IAEA.
Major elements of Khan's network have been uncovered in Malaysia and South Africa.
Malaysian police arrested a Sri Lankan businessman Bukhary Syed Abu Tahir who admitted shipping nuclear components to Iran and Libya at Khan's behest.
Tahir also admitted receiving two briefcases containing $3 million in cash from Iran in exchange for providing nuclear weapons material.
In South Africa, authorities are investigating the sale of nuclear weapons technology to Libya through middlemen tied to Khan.
Three individuals allegedly tied to the Khan network, including European nationals, were arrested as part of the South African investigation.
Khan, the one person who could provide answers to the many pending questions, is out of reach of the IAEA and U.S. intelligence agencies.
Pakistan has refused to allow intelligence officers to talk to Khan, while offering to relay written questions to him.
The problem with that arrangement is that investigators can't be sure whether it's Khan or someone else answering the questions.
Nonetheless, a Vienna based diplomat says the Pakistanis have been cooperative with U.S. and IAEA officials about disclosing what their investigators have uncovered concerning Khan's operations.
Cooperation between Pakistani government and the U.S. and IAEA "has moved slowly but positively," he said.
The IAEA wants to meet with Tahir, the Sri Lankan businessman currently in a Malaysian jail, to help officials frame better questions to Khan, the diplomat said.
In addition, the IAEA has requested permission from Islamabad to send its investigators to examine Pakistan's uranium centrifuges.
By comparing the Pakistan models with those in Iran, the IAEA can conclusively determine whether Iran's centrifuges originated in Pakistan.
Given that the Pakistan military, headed by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, is all powerful there and that A. Q. Khan was such a high profile figure, some experts scoff at Musharraf's insistence that he didn't know about Khan's nuclear black marketeering.
Husain Haqqani, the former Pakistani ambassador to Sri Lanka, said in an interview that "one would have to stretch the bounds of credulity to believe that the government wasn't involved."
"It's hard to believe that Pakistan's top scientist could travel to places like North Korea without the government's knowledge," he said.
Robert Oakley, former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, gives Musharraf and other senior leaders the benefit of the doubt, speculating that the general may have been shielded from full knowledge of Khan's proliferation activities.
"Did Pakistan's military know something was going on?
I'd say yes, Did they know everything?
Probably not," he said.
Oakley added that Khan's illicit export network wasn't a new creation but rather reversed the flow of information and material on the import network that Khan and the Pakistan military had used to acquire nuclear materials for their country's atomic program.
The assumption among some informed diplomats and intelligence officials is that, at a minimum, Khan must have had help from other senior scientists in the Pakistani government.
"Khan is a metallurgist, so he understood well about building centrifuges," a Vienna based diplomat said.
"But he wouldn't necessarily understand bomb designs nor would he understand uranium conversion and the many other technologies involved."
The Bush administration, always working to build up Musharraf, has accepted his claims of innocence.
Secretary of State Powell said that when he asked Musharraf if he had known about Khan's work, the general denied any knowledge.
Khan's nuclear network "was so compartmented within government circles" and Musharraf was "outside the circle," Powell said of Musharraf's explanation.
"That's what he has said to me, and I have no evidence to prove or disprove his statement."
All of which leads to the question of motive, another major thrust in the IAEA investigation.
While Khan profited financially from the sale of nuclear secrets, money likely was not the sole motivation.
The IAEA's ElBaradei has said that "ideology" also played a factor.
For example, Hassan Abbas, the former Pakistani security official, said Khan may have been motivated by the strategic view held by some Pakistani military leaders that spreading nuclear technology was a way to counter U.S. power and what Islamabad fears is an emerging alliance among India, the United States and Israel.
While Khan is not a religious extremist like bin Laden, he may also have been motivated by a pan Muslim view of spreading weapons to guarantee the influence of Muslim countries.
"Khan was motivated by some element of ideology, greed and convoluted strategic thinking," said Haqqani, the former Pakistani diplomat.
Another likely motivation is Khan's ample ego, said Oakley.
"It may be a little of, 'Look at me.
I am a great man,"' Oakley said.
Meanwhile, Khan passes time in his Islamabad estate, forbidden from public speaking.
The Pakistani government has not said how long his limbo will last, nor has it publicly explained the rules of what Khan is allowed to do while under house arrest.
But house arrest has a unique history in Pakistani politics, namely to take controversial individuals out of circulation, a penalty without substance, until the controversy blows over.
"As far as Pakistani law is concerned, Khan has not been convicted of any crime.
He has already been forgiven and pardoned," said Abbas.
"The house arrest isn't meant as a punishment but more as a sop to the Americans."
In Pakistan, Khan is often cast as a victim of Western pressure on the Musharraf government.
In a recent editorial, the Islamabad based Pakistan Newswire summed up Musharraf's predicament in the Khan case.
"Why is a person still acknowledged by no less a person than the president of Pakistan as a national hero being subjected to such humiliating treatment?" the editorial asked.
"Surely, the fact that the man had to apologize to the entire nation was punishment enough."

Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf on Sunday defended his decision not to allow international investigators to interrogate A.Q. Khan, the rogue Pakistani scientist accused of peddling nuclear secrets around the world.
Appearing offended, Musharraf said the requests from U.N. nuclear inspectors indicated a lack of trust in Pakistan.
In a CNN interview, he portrayed the issue as a matter of national pride.
President Bush met with Musharraf on Saturday and urged the Pakistani general to make sure that all possible information about nuclear proliferation by the Khan network be turned over to the Americans.
Musharraf promised to do so.
But the White House did not ask for direct access to Khan apparently in deference to Pakistani sensitivities about a man who, as the father of the Pakistani atomic bomb, had been considered a hero.
However, the International Atomic Energy Agency still wants to interview Khan, who has been pardoned by Musharraf, as well as his assistant, who is being held in Malaysia.
Lacking such cooperation, officials deem it unlikely that Khan's activities will ever be fully unraveled, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.
In the CNN interview Sunday, Musharraf insisted that Pakistan could do the best job interrogating Khan.
"It shows a lack of trust in us," Musharraf complained.
"We can question him the best, and then there is ,a domestic sensitivity.
This man is a hero for the Pakistanis and there is a sensitivity that maybe the world wants to intervene in our nuclear program, which nobody wants, "It is a pride of the nation," he concluded.
Analysts have raised doubts about whether Musharraf is keeping Khan from speaking to international investigators for fear the scientist might reveal the extent to which some of his activities may have been condoned by the Pakistani military.
Musharraf denied "200 percent" that any Pakistani government or the military had any knowledge that Khan was making nuclear weapons information available to other nations.
During a visit to the United States, the Pakistani leader, a key Bush administration ally in the war on terrorism, also said that in hindsight, the U.S. decision to invade Iraq was a mistake.
"We have landed ourselves in more trouble," he told CNN's "Late Edition."
Musharraf said he had no idea where Osama bin Laden was hiding but suggested that al Qaida's command structure in Pakistan has been broken by recent military operations aimed at rousting terrorist forces from tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan.
In Pakistan, pro government and opposition parties staged large street demonstrations to coincide with Musharraf's foreign tour.
In the central city of Multan, the main opposition Islamic alliance held a rally and vowed to force Musharraf to quit as army chief if he reneged on his promise to do so voluntarily by year's end, the Reuters news agency reported.
Loosening the military's control over politics has been a key goal of the Pakistani democracy movement, but the parliament recently passed a law that would allow Musharraf to continue to hold the top army job and the presidency.
A new report from the CIA says the arms trafficking network led by the Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan provided Iran's nuclear program with "significant assistance," including the designs for "advanced and efficient" weapons components.
The unclassified version of the report, posted Tuesday on the agency's Web site (www.cia.gov), does not say explicitly whether Khan's network sold Iran complete plans for building a warhead, as the network is known to have done for Libya and perhaps North Korea.
But it suggests that U.S. intelligence agencies now believe that the bomb making designs provided by the network to Iran in the 1990s were more significant than the U.S. government had previously disclosed.
In a recent closed door speech to a private group, George J. Tenet, the former director of central intelligence, described Khan, the father of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, as being "at least as dangerous as Osama bin Laden" because of his role in providing nuclear technology to other countries.
A tape recording of the speech was obtained by The New York Times.
The report, issued to Congress, is an annual update, required by law, on countries' acquisition of illicit weapons technology.
The posting of the unclassified version on the agency's Web site on Tuesday comes two days before a meeting in Vienna, Austria, of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear monitoring group, is scheduled to review the status of Iran's weapons program.
"The Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions" is the first to be issued by the agency since last November.
Its focus is the six month period from July to December 2003, but it also discusses broader trends.
The report says the agency remains convinced that Iran is pursuing a clandestine weapons program, despite claims to the contrary by the Tehran government.
It says Iran's stated willingness to allow inspections by the IAEA is likely to prevent Tehran from using its declared nuclear sites to produce weapons, but warns that it may use covert facilities for those purposes.
The CIA began to infiltrate Khan's network in the late 1990s, according to the account Tenet is now spelling out in his speeches.
That operation led to the unraveling of the network's ties to Libya and the unmasking last year of Libya's illicit weapons program.
Pakistani government said on Monday that Abdullah Q. Khan, the founder of the nation's nuclear program, will not be interrogated by concerned agencies from the United States.
The Foreign Office spokesman Masood Khan told a weekly press conference here that the Pakistani authorities have the ability to handle the nuclear proliferation control.
Earlier this month media reported that certain US officials suggested that "the Nuke father," who was involved in an illegal transfer of nuclear know how to Iran, should be interrogated by the US authority.
The spokesman said Pakistan has been cooperating well with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the nuclear proliferation control and there is no need to bring in the US aid in the sector.
A number of Pakistani scientists and officials had been detained for the proliferation scandal since Abdullah Q. Khan confessed for his wrong doing earlier this year.
When experts from the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency came upon blueprints for a 10 kiloton atomic bomb in the files of the Libyan weapons program earlier this year, they found themselves caught between gravity and pettiness.
The discovery gave the experts a new appreciation of the audacity of the rogue nuclear network led by A.Q. Khan, a chief architect of Pakistan's bomb.
Intelligence officials had watched Khan for years and suspected that he was trafficking in machinery for enriching uranium to make fuel for warheads.
But the detailed design represented a new level of danger, particularly since the Libyans said he had thrown it in as a deal sweetener when he sold them $100 million in nuclear gear.
"This was the first time we had ever seen a loose copy of a bomb design that clearly worked," said one American expert, "and the question was: Who else had it?
The Iranians?
The Syrians?
Al Qaida?"
But that threat was quickly overshadowed by smaller questions.
The experts from the United States and the IAEA, the U.N. nuclear watchdog in a reverberation of their differences over Iraq's unconventional weapons began quarreling over control of the blueprints.
The friction was palpable at Libya's Ministry of Scientific Research, said one participant, when the Americans accused international inspectors of having examined the design before they arrived.
After hours of tense negotiation, agreement was reached to keep it in a vault at the Energy Department in Washington, but under IAEA seal.
It was a sign of things to come.
Nearly a year after Khan's arrest, secrets of his nuclear black market continue to uncoil, revealing a vast global enterprise.
But the inquiry has been hampered by discord between the Bush administration and the nuclear watchdog, and by Washington's concern that if it pushes too hard for access to Khan, a national hero in Pakistan, it could destabilize an ally.
As a result, much of the urgency has been sapped from the investigation, helping keep hidden the full dimensions of the activities of Khan and his associates.
There is no shortage of tantalizing leads.
U.S. intelligence officials and the IAEA, working separately, are still untangling Khan's travels in the years before his arrest.
Investigators said he visited 18 countries, including Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, on what they believed were business trips, either to buy materials like uranium ore or sell atomic goods.
In Dubai, they have scoured one of the network's front companies, finding traces of radioactive material as well as phone records showing contact with Saudi Arabia.
Having tracked the network operations to Malaysia, Europe and the Middle East, investigators recently uncovered an outpost in South Africa, where they seized 11 crates of equipment for enriching uranium.
The breadth of the operation was particularly surprising to some U.S. intelligence officials because they had had Khan under surveillance for nearly three decades, since he began assembling components for Pakistan's bomb, but apparently missed crucial transactions with countries like Iran and North Korea.
In fact, officials were so confident they had accurately taken his measure, that twice once in the late 1970s and again in the 1980s the CIA persuaded Dutch intelligence agents not to arrest Khan because they wanted to follow his trail, according to a senior European diplomat and a former congressional official who had access to intelligence information.
The CIA declined to comment.
"We knew a lot," said a nuclear intelligence official, "but we didn't realize the size of his universe."
President Bush boasts that the Khan network has been dismantled.
But there is evidence that parts of it live on, as do investigations in Washington and Vienna, Austria, where the IAEA is based.
Cooperation between the U.N. atomic agency and the United States has trickled to a near halt, particularly as the Bush administration tries to unseat the IAEA director general, Mohamed ElBaradei, who did not support the White House's prewar intelligence assessments on Iraq.
The chill from the White House has blown through Vienna.
"I can't remember the last time we saw anything of a classified nature from Washington," one of the agency's senior officials said.
Experts see it as a missed opportunity because the two sides have complementary strengths the United States with spy satellites and covert capabilities to intercept or disable nuclear equipment, and the IAEA with inspectors who have access to some of the world's most secretive atomic facilities that the United States cannot legally enter.
In the 11 months since Khan's partial confession, Pakistan has denied U.S. investigators access to him.
They have passed questions through the Pakistanis, but report that there is virtually no new information on critical questions like who else obtained the bomb design.
Nor have U.S. investigators been given access to Khan's chief operating officer, Buhari Sayed Abu Tahir, who is in a Malaysian jail.
This disjunction has helped to keep many questions about the network unanswered, including whether the Pakistani military was involved in the black market and what other countries, or nonstate groups, beyond Libya, Iran and North Korea, received what one Bush administration official called Khan's "nuclear starter kit" everything from centrifuge designs to raw uranium fuel to the blueprints for the bomb.
Privately, investigators say that with so many mysteries unsolved, they have little confidence that the illicit atomic marketplace has actually been shut down.
"It may be more like al Qaida," said one IAEA official, "where you cut off the leadership but new elements emerge."
A POTENTIAL DANGER A.Q. Khan may have been unknown to most Americans when he was revealed about a year ago as the mastermind of the largest illicit nuclear proliferation network in history.
But for three decades Khan, a metallurgist, has been well known to British and U.S. intelligence officials.
Even so, the United States and its allies passed up opportunities to stop him and apparently failed to detect that he had begun selling nuclear technology to Iran in the late 1980s.
It was the opening transaction for an enterprise that eventually spread to North Korea, Libya and beyond.
Khan studied in Pakistan and Europe.
After he secured a job in the Netherlands in the early 1970s at a plant making centrifuges the devices that purify uranium Dutch intelligence officials began watching him.
By late 1975, they grew so wary, after he was observed at a nuclear trade show in Switzerland asking suspicious questions, that they moved him to a different area of the company to keep him away from uranium enrichment work.
"There was an awareness," said Frank Slijper of the Dutch Campaign against Arms Trade, who recently wrote a report on Khan's early days, "that he was a potential danger."
Khan suddenly left the country that December, called home by his government for its atomic project.
Years later, investigators discovered that he had taken blueprints for the centrifuges with him.
In Pakistan, Khan was working to develop a bomb to counter India's, and Washington was intent on stopping the project.
It later proved to be the first of several occasions when the United States failed to fully understand what Khan was up to.
Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor who has served in several administrations, said U.S. intelligence agencies thought Pakistan would try to make its bomb by producing plutonium an alternative bomb fuel.
Nye was sent to France to halt the shipment of technology that would have enabled Pakistan to complete a reprocessing plant for the plutonium fuel.
"We returned to Washington to celebrate our victory, only to discover that Khan had already stolen the technology for another path to the bomb," Nye recalled.
To gather more atomic gear and skill, Khan returned to the Netherlands repeatedly.
But the United States wanted to watch him, and a European diplomat with wide knowledge of nuclear intelligence cited the two occasions when the CIA persuaded the Dutch authorities not to arrest him.
Intelligence officials apparently felt Khan was more valuable as an unwitting guide to the nuclear underworld.
"The Dutch wanted to arrest him," the diplomat said.
"But they were told by the American CIA, 'Leave him so we can follow his trail."'
A CHINESE CONNECTION Khan quickly led the agents to Beijing.
It was there in the early 1980s that Khan pulled off a coup: obtaining the blueprints for a weapon that China had detonated in its fourth nuclear test, in 1966.
The design was notable because it was compact and the first one China had developed that could easily fit atop a missile.
U.S. intelligence agencies only learned the full details of the transactions earlier this year when the Libyans handed over two large plastic bags with the names of an Islamabad tailor on one side and a dry cleaner on other one of several clues that it had come from the Khan Laboratories.
The design inside included drawings of more than 100 parts, all fitting in a sphere about 34 inches in diameter, just the right size for a rocket.
Equally remarkable were the handwritten notations in the margins.
"They made reference to Chinese ministers, presumably involved in the deal," one official who reviewed it disclosed.
And there was also a reference to "Munir," apparently Munir Khan, Khan's rival who ran the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and was in a contest with Khan to put together a Pakistani weapon that would match India's.
In that race, size was critical, because only a small weapon could be put atop Pakistani missiles.
One note in the margin of the design, the official said, was that "Munir's bomb would be bigger."
Intelligence experts believe that Khan traded his centrifuge technology to the Chinese for their bomb design.
A certain familiarity developed between Khan and those watching him.
"I remember I was once in Beijing on a nonproliferation mission," said Robert J. Einhorn, a longtime proliferation official in the State Department, "and we knew that Khan was in Beijing, too, and where he was.
I had this fantasy of going over to his hotel, calling up to his room, and inviting him down for a cup of coffee."
Of course, he never did.
But if he had, Khan might not have been surprised.
Simon Henderson, a London based author who has written about Khan for more than two decades, said the Pakistani scientist long suspected he was under close surveillance.
"Khan once told me, indignantly, 'The British try to recruit members of my team as spies,"' Henderson recalled.
"As far as I'm aware, he was penetrated for a long, long time."
Still, for all the surveillance, U.S. officials always seemed a step or two behind.
In the 1990s, noted Einhorn, the assumption was that Iran was getting most of its help from Russia, which was providing the country with reactors and laser isotope technology.
Virtually no attention was paid to its contacts with Khan.
"It was a classic case of being focused in the wrong place," Einhorn said.
"And if Iran gets the bomb in the next few years, it won't be because of the Russians.
It will be because of the help they got from A.Q.
Khan."
TRIUMPH AND MYSTERY As soon as Bush came to office, his director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, began tutoring him on the dangers of Khan and disclosing how deeply the agency believed it had penetrated his life and network.
"We were inside his residence, inside his facilities, inside his rooms," Tenet said in a recent speech.
"We were everywhere these people were."
But acting on the Khan problem meant navigating the sensitivities of a fragile ally important in the effort against terrorism.
That has impeded the inquiry ever since.
Washington had little leverage to force Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, to clamp down on a national hero, especially since Khan may have had evidence implicating the Pakistani government in some of the transactions.
And in interviews, officials said they feared that moving on Khan too early would hurt their chances to roll up the network.
Stephen J. Hadley, the deputy national security adviser, went to Pakistan soon after the Sept 11 attacks and raised concerns about Khan, some of whose scientists were said to have met with Osama bin Laden, al Qaida's leader.
But Hadley did not ask Musharraf to take action, according to a senior administration official.
He returned to Washington complaining that it was unclear whether the Khan Laboratories were operating with the complicity of the Pakistani military, or were controlled by freelancers, motivated by visions of profit or of spreading the bomb to Islamic nations.
The Pakistanis insisted they had no evidence of any proliferation at all, a claim U.S. officials said they found laughable.
As evidence grew in 2003, Bush sent Tenet to New York to meet with Musharraf.
"We were afraid Khan's operation was entering a new, more dangerous phase," said one top official.
Still there was little action.
But in late October 2003, the United States and its allies seized the BBC China, a freighter bearing centrifuge parts made in Malaysia, along with other products of Khan's network, all bound for Libya.
Confronted with the evidence, Libya finally agreed to surrender all of its nuclear program.
Within weeks, tons of equipment was being dismantled and flown to the Energy Department's nuclear weapons lab at Oak Ridge, Tenn.
Pressures mounted on Musharraf.
"I said to him, 'We know so much about this that we're going to go public with it,"' Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told journalists last week.
"'And you need to deal with this before you have to deal with it publicly."'
On television, Khan was forced to confess but he gave no specifics, and Musharraf pardoned the scientist.
U.S. officials pressed to interview him and his chief lieutenant, Tahir, a Sri Lankan businessman living in Dubai and Malaysia, who was eventually arrested by Malaysian authorities.
But the Pakistanis balked, insisting that they would pass questions to Khan and report back.
Little information has been conveyed.
"Some questions simply were never answered," said one senior intelligence official.
"In other cases, you don't know if you were getting Khan's answer, or the answer the government wanted you to hear."
Khan's silence has extended to the question of what countries, other than Libya, received the bomb design.
Intelligence experts say they have no evidence any other nation received the design, although they suspect Iran and perhaps North Korea.
But that search has been hampered by lack of hard intelligence.
"We strongly believe Iran did," said one U.S. official.
"But we need the proof."
Khan has also never discussed his ties with North Korea, a critical issue because the United States has alleged but cannot prove that North Korea has two nuclear arms programs, one using Khan technology.
"It is an unbelievable story, how this administration has given Pakistan a pass on the single worst case of proliferation in the past half century," said Jack Pritchard, who worked for President Clinton and served as the State Department's special envoy to North Korea until he quit last year, partly in protest over Bush's Korea policy.
"We've given them a pass because of Musharraf's agreement to fight terrorism, and now there is some suggestion that the hunt for Osama is waning.
And what have we learned from Khan?
Nothing."
SOME MISSING PIECES In March, U.S. investigators invited reporters to the giant nuclear complex in Oak Ridge to display the equipment disgorged by the Libyans.
They surrounded the site with guards bearing automatic weapons, and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham joined the officials in showing off some of the 4000 centrifuges.
"We've had a huge success," he said.But it turned out that the centrifuges were missing their rotors the high speed internal device that makes them work.
To this day, it is not clear where those parts were coming from.
While some officials believe the Libyans were going to make their own, others fear the equipment had been shipped from an unknown location and that the network, while headless, is still alive.
John R. Bolton, the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, echoed those suspicions, saying the network still had a number of undisclosed customers.
"There's more out there than we can discuss publicly," Bolton said in April.
Federal and private experts said the list of suspected customers includes Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Algeria, Kuwait, Myanmar and Abu Dhabi.
Given the urgency of the Libyan and Khan disclosures, many private and governmental experts expected that the Bush administration and the IAEA would work together.
But European diplomats said the administration never turned over valuable information to back up its wider suspicions about other countries.
"It doesn't like to share," a senior European diplomat involved in nuclear intelligence said of the United States.
"That makes life more difficult.
So we're on the learning curve."
Federal officials said they were reluctant to give the IAEA classified information because the agency is too prone to leaks.
The agency has 137 member states, and U.S. officials believe some of them may be using the agency to hunt for nuclear secrets.
One senior administration official put it this way: "The cops and the crooks all serve on the agency's board together."
The result is that two separate, disjointed searches are on for other nuclear rogue states one by Washington, the other by the IAEA.
And there is scant communication between the feuding bureaucracies.
That lack of communication with the U.N. agency extends to the Nuclear Suppliers Group, a loose organization of countries that produce nuclear equipment.
It can stop the export of restricted atomic technology to a suspect customer, but it does not report its actions to the IAEA.
Moreover, there is no communication between the IAEA and the Bush administration's Proliferation Security Initiative, which seeks to intercept illicit nuclear trade at sea or in the air.
"It's a legitimate question whether we need a very different kind of super agency that can deal with the new world of A.Q. Khans," said a senior administration official.
"Because we sure don't have the system we need now."
THE HUNT GOES ON ElBaradei, the head of the U.N. agency, says he is plunging ahead, pursuing his own investigation even as the Bush administration attempts to have him replaced when his term expires late next year.
In an interview in Vienna, he defended his record, citing the information he has wrung out of Iran, and his agency's discovery of tendrils of Khan's network in more than 30 countries around the globe.
"We're getting an idea of how it works," he said of the Khan network.
"And we're still looking" for other suppliers and customers.
One method is to investigate the countries Khan visited before his arrest.
Nuclear experts disclosed that the countries were Afghanistan, Egypt, Iran, Ivory Coast, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.
Many of them are Islamic, and several of the African countries are rich in uranium ore.
In one of its biggest operations, the agency is hunting for nuclear clues in a half dozen of the network's buildings and warehouses in Dubai, which for years were used as the central location for assembling and repacking centrifuges.
Both in Washington and in Vienna, the most delicate investigations involve important American allies including Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
So far, said European intelligence officials familiar with the agency's inner workings, no hard evidence of clandestine nuclear arms programs has surfaced.
Suspicious signs have emerged, however.
For instance, experts disclosed that SMB Computers, Tahir's front company in Dubai for the Khan network, made telephone calls to Saudi Arabia.
But the company also engaged in legitimate computer sales, giving it plausible cover.
Experts also disclosed that Saudi scientists traveled to Pakistan for some of Khan's scientific conferences.
But the meetings were not secret, or illegal.
There is also worry in both Washington and Vienna about Egypt, which has two research reactors near Cairo and a long history of internal debate about whether to pursue nuclear arms.
But European intelligence officials said IAEA inspectors who recently went there found no signs of clandestine nuclear arms and some evidence of shoddy workmanship that bespeaks low atomic expectations.As for Syria, the Bush administration had repeatedly charged that it has secretly tried to acquire nuclear arms.
But the IAEA has so far found no signs of a relationship with Khan or a clandestine nuclear weapons program.
Worried about what is still unknown, the IAEA is quietly setting up what it calls the Covert Nuclear Trade Analysis Unit, agency officials disclosed.
It has about a half dozen specialists who are scanning international files and records and databases for evidence of secret nuclear deals by the Khan network or its imitators.
"I would not be surprised to discover that some countries pocketed some centrifuges," ElBaradei said.
"They may have considered it a chance of a lifetime to get some equipment and thought, 'Well, maybe it will be good for a rainy day."'
Pakistan on Monday denied reports in a US magazine that it was helping American special forces target suspected weapons sites for air strikes in neighbouring Iran.
"There is no such collaboration," foreign ministry spokesman Masood Khan said, referring to an article in the New Yorker magazine that claimed Pakistani scientists were providing the US with information on Iranian nuclear sites.
"We do not have much information about Iran's nuclear programme so I think this report is far fetched and it exaggerates facts which do not exist in the first place," Khan told a weekly press briefing in Islamabad.
"I do not think there is any substance in what has been reported.
I think this is pure conjecture."
The New Yorker said Pakistan was helping the US in return for guarantees that it will not have to hand over disgraced nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan to international authorities for questioning.
Khan, the architect of Pakistan's nuclear programme, in February took responsibility for transfers of nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea.
He was pardoned by President Pervez Musharraf.
The magazine said Pakistani scientists were giving information to be used by US commandos searching for underground nuclear installations in eastern Iran.
Investigators looking into illicit transfers of nuclear weapons technology have recently uncovered a South African based scheme to deliver a complete uranium enrichment plant to Libya, The Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.
Citing documents and interviews, the newspaper said the discovery provided fresh evidence of the reach and sophistication of Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan's global black market in nuclear know how and equipment.
The dimensions of the plot began to emerge in September, when police raided a factory outside Johannesburg, according to the report.
They found the elements of a two story steel processing system for the enrichment plant, packed in 11 freight containers for shipment to Libya.
South African officials have disclosed only that they discovered nuclear components, the paper said.
But The Times has learned that the massive system was designed to operate an array of 1000 centrifuges for enriching uranium.
Once assembled in Libya, the plant could have produced enough weapons grade uranium to manufacture several nuclear bombs a year, according to the report.
Delivery of the plant would have greatly accelerated Libya's efforts to develop nuclear weapons, The Times said.
The discovery of a South African connection to A.Q. Khan network has led to the arrests of four business and engineering figures in South Africa, including some who had been involved in the former apartheid regime's nuclear program, the paper said.
Khan, the disgraced architect of Pakistan's nuclear program, took full responsibility in February for nuclear leaks to Iran, Libya and North Korea.
Libya has since renounced its nuclear program and allowed the United States to ship its key technological components out of the country.
South Africa, which was close to testing a nuclear device in the late 1970s, has abandoned its nuclear program following the collapse of the apartheid regime.
The government expressed skepticism Thursday over a claim by an Iranian opposition group that Abdul Qadeer Khan, the disgraced father of Pakistan's nuclear program, had given Iran a blueprint for a nuclear bomb and some weapons grade uranium.
"We do not attach importance to this report or claim," Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan told a news conference in the capital, Islamabad.
"The validity of this claim is being questioned and it is being viewed with skepticism."
Pakistan's official reaction came a day after Farid Soleimani, a former senior official for the National Council for Resistance in Iran, told reporters in Vienna that Tehran received the bomb diagram between 1994 and 1996 and a quantity of highly enriched uranium from Khan in 2001.
While the Pakistani spokesman dismissed the claim, he said its investigations into the unauthorized spread of nuclear technology were yet not closed.
Masood Khan said Pakistan had not received a report through formal channels on the claim, and it was open to "any communication."
Pakistan has said it is cooperating with the International Atomic Energy Agency in its investigations into the international nuclear black market, although it has not let the agency question Khan.
Khan has been under virtual house arrest in Islamabad since a scandal broke in December over his alleged black market dealings that supplied nuclear weapons technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya.
President Gen. Pervez Musharraf pardoned Khan long revered in Pakistan for helping build a nuclear deterrent against rival India after he made a public confession in February.
All but one of Khan's colleagues have been released after questioning.
Pakistan has defended its efforts to halt leaks of nuclear technology amid suggestions that Iran's nuclear weapons program received more help from a renegade Pakistani scientist than previously disclosed.
The CIA which provides the U.S. Congress with six monthly updates on reported efforts by Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and Syria to obtain chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons technology posted an unclassified version on its Web site this week.
Analyzing the report, The New York Times said it indicates that bomb making designs provided by Abdul Qadeer Khan to Iran in the 1990s were more significant than Washington has said.
Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman Masood Khan criticized the Times report, saying it was "based on flimsy evidence, hearsay and snippets of conversations.
"The CIA report does not mention any 'designs for weapons or bomb making components.'
Weapons and bomb making are the writer's own creative insertions," the spokesman said Saturday.
"In the past year, Pakistan has conducted an inquiry to unearth an illicit network of international black marketeers, dismantled it and shared the results of the inquiry transparently with the people of Pakistan.
"Pakistan has been cooperating with the IAEA and the international community to thwart international black marketeers from proliferating sensitive nuclear technology," Masood Khan said.
The International Atomic Energy Agency the United Nations' nuclear watchdog has been investigating Iran's nuclear activities for about 18 months, but the agency remains unable to determine if nearly two decades of Iranian nuclear activities were purely peaceful or if the government had a secret weapons agenda.
Tehran says its activities were for generating electricity, while the United States says they were for making weapons.
Iran and European negotiators have reached a tentative compromise committing Tehran to freeze all uranium enrichment activities, diplomats say, but the Iranian government still must approve the deal.
A.Q. Khan, considered a national hero for leading the development of Pakistan's nuclear deterrent, admitted in February to passing nuclear technology to other countries.
He was pardoned by President Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who cited his service to the nation, but remains under virtual house arrest in Islamabad.
"Iran's nuclear program received significant assistance in the past from the proliferation network headed by Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan," the CIA report said.
"The A.Q. Khan network provided Iran with designs for Pakistan's older centrifuges as well as designs for more advanced and efficient models and components."
It said Libya disclosed receiving similar assistance from Khan, head of Pakistan's nuclear program from the 1970s until 2001.
"Even in cases where states took action to stem such transfers, knowledgeable individuals or non state purveyors of WMD and missile related materials and technology could act outside government constraints," the report said.
The Times focused on the phrase "designs for more advanced and efficient models, and components," indicating that "components" refers to weapons components.
The Times said American officials have publicly referred only to the role of A.Q. Khan's network in supplying Iran with designs for older Pakistani centrifuges used to enrich uranium, but that they also suspect it provided a warhead design.
Citing a tape it obtained of a closed door speech to a private group, the paper quoted former CIA Director George J. Tenet describing A.Q. Khan as "at least as dangerous as Osama bin Laden" because of his role in providing nuclear technology to other countries.
Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of the Pakistani atomic bomb, delivered weapons grade highly enriched uranium to Iran in 2001, and Iran aims at getting a nuclear bomb next year, an Iranian opposition group said in Vienna Wednesday.
Pakistan will not let any foreigners question Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of the country's nuclear bomb who has admitted leaking secrets to states including North Korea, Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri said Wednesday.
"We have refused direct interrogations by anyone.
The reason is national sensitivity," Kasuri told a press conference at the end of a three day visit to Tokyo.
Kasuri said Pakistan had acted against Khan even though the Pakistani opposition had accused the government of "succumbing to international pressure" against the local hero.
"Actions have been taken (against Khan) and they are very strict.
We are prepared,to investigate and share information," Kasuri said.
He noted that Khan, who os effectively under house arrest, had interacted with foreigners when he leaked informaton of the country's nuclear technology.
"In fact there were some foreigners involved.
Pakistan has taken actions.
Other foreigners, we hope actions will be taken against them by their governments," Kasuri said.
Khan, who is credited with making Pakistan a nuclear power, confessed in February 2004 to leaking nuclear know how to Iran, Libya and North Korea.
Khan was later pardoned by President Pervez Musharraf, who has repeatedly refused to allow the United States or the International Atomic Energy Agency to question him.
"We have shared information with the International Atomic Energy Agency," Kasuri said.
"We have shared all information we had on any issue relevant to this (Khan) with the United States and friendly countries, definitely with the government of Japan," he said.
"If there are new leads, we will investigate those," he added.
Japan is locked in a standoff with North Korea over the Stalinist state's kidnapping of Japanese citizens.
Pyongyang fired a missile over Japan into the Pacific Ocean in 1998.
"We are sensitive to Japanese concerns.
We will share any information we have relevant to your security," Kasuri said.
Pakistan said Wednesday the case of disgraced nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan was still open but it has received no new evidence to suggest that his black market network had sold technology to more countries than earlier thought.
Last February, President Gen. Pervez Musharraf pardoned Khan after he confessed to supplying sensitive technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea.
But this week Time magazine reported that U.S. officials were also investigating whether the scientist's network might have supplied Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, such as Egypt.
On Wednesday, Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan said A.Q. Khan's "case is still open."
"We will quiz any of our scientists if somebody comes up with evidence to prove his links with the proliferators of nuclear technology," the spokesman told The Associated Press.
But he said the government had "received no new evidence from any country, individual or organization, including IAEA" referring to the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the Vienna based International Atomic Energy Agency.
A.Q. Khan, who was once regarded as a national hero for his role in making Pakistan a nuclear power, has lived under virtual house arrest in Islamabad for the past year.
On Monday, Pakistan denied that Khan's network was still operating and denied a specific allegation in Time magazine's report that 16 cylinders of uranium hexafluoride gas a critical ingredient for uranium enrichment for weapons had gone missing from Pakistan's main nuclear lab, the Khan Research Laboratories, named after the scientist.
"As far as we are concerned, we have fulfilled our responsibility by dismantling this network from Pakistan, and we are quite vigilant and alert now," the Foreign Ministry spokesman said Wednesday.
He reiterated that Pakistan would not allow any country, individual or even the IAEA to interrogate its scientists.
"We are a responsible nuclear state, and we have full confidence in our investigations system," he said.
Pakistan denies there was any official involvement in Khan's illegal nuclear trading, which earned the scientist a fortune.
Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi Thursday said his country was not going to hand over an alleged deputy of Pakistan's disgraced nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khah to anyone as investigations were still in progress.
"No, there is no move to hand him over to anybody and he is still detained by us," Badawi told a press conference in Islamabad when asked if Buhary Syed Abu Tahir was being handed over to the United States.
Tahir has been named by US President George W. Bush as "deputy" to Khan in an international nuclear trafficking ring.
"Our,intelligence people like to speak and continue to talk to him.
Obviously, there are lot of things we would like to know from him," Badawi said.
Tahir told Malaysian police last year that Khan sold nuclear centrifuge parts to Iran in the mid 1990s and sent enriched uranium to Libya in 2001.
Khan, a disgraced one time national hero credited with making Pakistan a nuclear power, confessed in February 2004 to leaking nuclear secrets.
He was later pardoned by President Pervez Musharraf.
On the nuclear row between Iran and the United States, Badawi said, "We do not want to see Iraq's situation repeated in Iran."
The United States accuses Iran of seeking to build nuclear weapons.
Tehran has vehemently denied the charges, arguing that its atomic activities are solely for peaceful purposes.
Last month Bush said he could not rule out using force if Tehran failed to rein in its nuclear plans, and US Vice President Dick Cheney said Iran was "right at the top of the list" of global troublespots.
Badawi said that any differences between Iran and the United States "should be resolved through diplomatic channel."
Pakistan Monday dismissed as "baseless" a report in a US magazine that its disgraced top nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan sold sensitive equipment to Saudi Arabia.
Information Minister Sheikh Rashid said the report in the latest edition of Time was full of distortion.
"The story is without facts and baseless," he told AFP.
The magazine reported that the United States was investigating whether Khan sold nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and some other countries.
The news weekly, citing a source in Pakistan's defense ministry, said Khan had also played a bigger role in helping Iran and North Korea with their nuclear programs than had been previously disclosed.
"US intelligence officials believe Khan sold North Korea much of the material needed to build a bomb, including high speed centrifuges used to enrich uranium and the equipment required to manufacture more of them," Time said.
But Rashid said Islamabad was cooperating with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the world community by sharing the results of its own probe, which it said led to the dismantling of an illegal proliferation network.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has not allowed the US or the IAEA to interrogate Khan, who appeared on Pakistani state television in February 2004 and took full responsibility for transfers of nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea.
Musharraf gave him a conditional pardon and has said that no government or military body was involved in the proliferation scandal.
The minister insisted that Pakistan would never hand over the father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb to any other country.
Pakistan Monday rejected a report that disgraced nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan sold equipment to Saudi Arabia but said its probe into a proliferation scandal centred on him was not over.
Senior officials said Islamabad would look into any fresh evidence if it emerged but described the article in US weekly Time as baseless and a rehash of previous reports.
"This is not correct," foreign ministry spokesman Masood Khan told reporters at a weekly briefing when asked if Khan, the father of Pakistan's atomic programme, had sold technology to fellow Muslim nation Saudi Arabia.
"The allegation has been made several times in the past, but this is part of a disinformation campaign.
It is baseless (and) does not have any substance," he added.
"It is a rehash of several speculative stories which have appeared in the media in the recent past."
Abdul Qadeer Khan has been under effective house arrest since he appeared on Pakistan state television in February 2004 and took full responsibility for passing nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf gave him a conditional pardon and has said that no government or military body was involved in the scandal.
But the military leader has steadfastly refused to allow the US or the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) to interrogate Khan.
Time magazine, citing a source in Pakistan's defense ministry, said Khan had also played a bigger role in helping Ir without facts".
The minister and the spokesman both denied claims that 16 cylinders of uranium hexafluoride gas used for uranium enrichment were missing from the country's main enrichment facility, Khan Research Laboratories (KRL).
"Our inventory is complete and nothing is missing from KRL," Rashid said.
Editors: The following is now scheduled and will move shortly: IRAN NUCLEAR WASHINGTON International investigators have uncovered evidence of a secret meeting 18 years ago between Iranian officials and associates of Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan that resulted in a written offer to supply Tehran with the makings of a nuclear weapons program, foreign diplomats and U.S. officials familiar with the new findings said.1580 words, by Dafna Linzer (Post).
Includes Optional Trim.
The United States is investigating whether Pakistani scientist Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan sold nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and other countries, Time magazine reported Sunday.
The news weekly, citing a source in Pakistan's defense ministry, said that Khan, the father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb, had also played a bigger role in helping Iran and North Korea with their nuclear programs than had been previously disclosed.
"US intelligence officials believe Khan sold North Korea much of the material needed to build a bomb, including high speed centrifuges used to enrich uranium and the equipment required to manufacture more of them," Time said.
Iran also may have bought centrifuges and weapons designs from Khan in the mid 1990s, Time said, adding that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had confirmed at least 13 meetings between 1994 and 1999 with representatives of Khan's network.
Among the countries known to have been helped by Khan was Libya.
Time said the Pakistani scientist had given the Libyans equipment for centrifuges and "technical instructions for how to build a nuclear warhead."
Time said US and IAEA investigators believe Khan also traveled to Saudi Arabia and Egypt and to such African countries as Sudan, Ivory Coast and Niger.
It said the purpose of those trips "remains unclear."
"But intelligence officials have hunches: Saudi Arabia and Egypt are believed to be in the market for nuclear technology, and many African countries are rich in raw uranium ore," the magazine said.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has not allowed the United States or the IAEA to interrogate Khan directly, but the United States has submitted questions to him asking whether North Korea and Iran sold nuclear equipment to third parties, Time said.
The magazine said the United States does not have "concrete evidence" that Khan did business with Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, but "there is reason to suspect that such a link exists.
"Members of Pakistan's military and intelligence establishment, which worked closely with Khan in his role as the government's top nuclear scientist, are known to sympathize with Osama bin Laden," the magazine said.
Time also said that although the 68 year old Khan is under house arrest in Pakistan and in failing health the Pakistani nuclear scientist's "illicit network of suppliers and middlemen is still out there."
Khan appeared on Pakistani television in February 2004 and took full responsibility for transfers of nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea.
Musharraf gave him a conditional pardon and has said that no government or military body was involved in the proliferation scandal.
Pakistan's government on Monday rejected a media report that an international black market in weapons technology, run by disgraced Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan, may have sold equipment to Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries.
But while Information Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed described as "baseless" the allegations printed in this week's edition of Time magazine, he did not rule out the possibility that Khan could have sold technology to more countries than initially thought.
"We don't know of any other country that he gave nuclear technology to.
But if there is another country, we will investigate," Ahmed told The Associated Press.
"If there are any questions (for Khan) we will ask them."
Khan, once regarded as a national hero for his role in developing Pakistan's nuclear deterrent against rival India, has lived under virtual house arrest here since he confessed in February 2004 to selling sensitive technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea.
President Gen. Pervez Musharraf has pardoned Khan, and says the scientist's international network has been dismantled.
The government denies any official involvement in the multimillion dollar (euro) illicit trade that earned Khan a fortune estimated by Time at up to US$400 million (euro311 million).
The United States has submitted questions to Pakistan to ask Khan about whether North Korea and Iran sold nuclear equipment to third parties, but authorities have apparently not allowed U.S. agents to interview Khan themselves.
The Time report cited an unidentified Pakistani Defense Ministry official as saying that U.S. officials were investigating whether Khan's network might have sold nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, such as Egypt.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan also denied the Time report.
He also denied that Khan's network supplied Saudi Arabia with nuclear technology.
"The international black market network as far as it was related to Pakistan has been dismantled.
It has been neutralized," he said at a weekly news briefing in Islamabad.
Khan blamed unnamed "constituencies who launch and sustain this kind of disinformation campaign.
Pakistan is a nuclear state and this is one of the risks that is involved in this status."
Ahmed said that Pakistan remained in contact with the Vienna based U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, but reiterated that it would not hand over the scientist for questioning by non Pakistanis.
"We have inquired as much as we can, if somebody has more questions, we are ready to satisfy IAEA," he said.
"But there is no way to deliver A.Q. Khan to anyone."
He denied that Khan's network was still operating and one specific allegation in the report that 16 cylinders of uranium hexafluoride gas a critical ingredient for uranium enrichment for weapons had gone missing from Pakistan's leading nuclear lab, the Khan Research Laboratories, named after the scientist.
"There are no cylinders missing from KRL.
The inventory is complete," Ahmed said.
Last week, U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker told reporters that investigations into the full scope of Khan's network were continuing, and that the United States was looking forward to hearing the full results of Pakistan's inquiries.
Khan, the foreign ministry spokesman, said Pakistan has shared the results of its investigations "transparently and candidly" with the international community.
"I think it's a joint responsibility of the international community, all key actors to act against proliferation," he said.
"That's why our investigations are continuing and if fresh leads emerge we would like to check them out and if fresh evidence is furnished to us we would like to look into that."
Pakistan Monday dismissed as " incorrect and unrealistic" a US Time magazine report that the United States is investigating whether the father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb sold nuclear technologies to Saudi Arabia and other countries.
Time magazine in its latest edition also claimed that Pakistan' s Abdul Qadeer Khan network of suppliers and middlemen is still operational.
"The Time has distorted the facts and made them sensationalize.
There is no reality in the report and it is not based on facts," Information Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed told Geo television.
He said Qadeer Khan has admitted to provide information to three countries but the Time story about selling technologies to Saudi Arabia or other Arab countries is incorrect.
Rashid also rejected the magazine's claim that some cylinders have disappeared from Kahuta Research Laboratories (LRL), the country's major nuclear facility.
"We have checked all the record and no cylinder is missing from the KRL.
We are ready to remove apprehensions if there are any," Rashid said.
Time magazine quoted sources as confirming that the United States has submitted questions to Qadeer Khan on whether the countries he allegedly provided nuclear secrets have sold such equipment to third parties.
"We have solved Dr Qadeer Khan's issue and he will not be handed over to any country," Rashid said.
He said there is no pressure on Pakistan on the issue and Pakistan is in touch with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
At a weekly news briefing, Foreign Office spokesman Masood Khan also categorically denied the magazine's story, saying the report is "highly speculated."
He added that Pakistan is still fully investigating the Qadeer Khan case and shares the results with the United States and the European countries.
"We have not closed the investigation," the spokesman said.
Pakistan's nuclear assets are under foolproof security parameters and their safety can be surely guaranteed, said Pakistani foreign office spokesman Wednesday.
"All the allegations raised against Pakistan by the Time Magazine report are baseless and unfounded," Masood Ahmed Khan said at a PTV program.
He said Pakistan had established Command and Control Authority, Strategic Plan Division and Strategic Forces bringing everything into a parameter of reliable intelligence mechanism.
Besides, Pakistan had been in constant contact with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its role in breaking the international nuclear black market was acknowledged and appreciated by the world community.
"There is no chance of the transfer of nuclear information or technology from Pakistan to any other country," he said.
When asked about the investigation into Dr Abdul Qadir Khan, Masood said Pakistan had thoroughly investigated the case against Dr Abdul Qadir Khan and his associates, and proper security measures had been taken on the basis of results obtained through investigation.
He said further investigation in this regard could be made only when there was solid evidence.
Rumors and speculations cannot be taken into account in this regard.
The latest edition of the US based Time Magazine alleged that the nuclear international black market of Qadir Khan is still operational.
The angry mother of a fallen U.S. soldier has met with advisers of President George W. Bush after staging a protest near his ranch to demand an accounting of how the president has conducted the war in Iraq.
Supported by more than 50 demonstrators who chanted, "W. killed her son!"
Cindy Sheehan told reporters: "I want to ask the president, 'Why did you kill my son?
What did my son die for?'"
Sheehan, 48, didn't get to see Bush, but did talk about 45 minutes with national security adviser Steve Hadley and deputy White House chief of staff Joe Hagin, who went out to hear her concerns.
Appreciative of their attention, yet undaunted, Sheehan said she planned to continue her roadside vigil, except for a few breaks, until she gets to talk to Bush.
Her son, Casey, 24, was killed in Sadr City, Iraq, on April 4, 2004.
He was an Army specialist, a Humvee mechanic.
"They (the advisers) said we are in Iraq because they believed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, that the world's a better place with Saddam gone and that we're making the world a safer place with what we're doing over there," Sheehan said in a telephone interview after the meeting.
"They were very respectful.
They were nice men.
I told them Iraq was not a threat to the United States and that now people are dead for nothing.
I told them I wouldn't leave until I talked to George Bush."
She said Hagin told her, "I want to assure you that he (Bush) really does care."
"And I said if he does care, why doesn't he come out and talk to me."
Sheehan arrived in Crawford aboard a bus painted red, white and blue and emblazoned with the words, "Impeachment Tour."
Sheehan, from Vacaville, California, had been attending a Veterans for Peace convention in Dallas.
The bus, trailed by about 20 cars of protesters and reporters, drove at about 15 (24 kph) toward Bush's ranch.
After several miles (kilometers), they parked the vehicles and began to march, in stifling heat, farther down the narrow country road.
Flanked by miles (kilometers) of pasture, Sheehan spoke with reporters while clutching two photographs, one of her son in uniform, and the other, a baby picture, when he was seven months old.
She said she decided to come to Crawford a few days ago after Bush said that fallen U.S. troops had died for a noble cause and that the mission must be completed.
"I want to ask the president, 'Why did you kill my son?
What did my son die for?" she said, her voice cracking with emotion.
"Last week, you said my son died for a noble cause' and I want to ask him what that noble cause is?"
White House spokesman Trent Duffy said response that Bush also wants the troops to return home safely.
"Many of the hundreds of families the president has met with know their loved one died for a noble cause and that the best way to honor their sacrifice is to complete the mission," Duffy said.
"It is a message the president has heard time and again from those he has met with and comforted.
Like all Americans, he wants the troops home as soon as possible."
The mother of an American soldier killed in Iraq led a protest march on President Bush's ranch here on Saturday, prompting the White House to send two senior officials to meet her after she was blocked by the authorities from approaching Bush's home.
The mother, Cindy Sheehan, who has made regular public appearances in opposition to the war, was accompanied by several dozen chanting anti war activists, including other parents who had lost children to the war, as she walked down a country road toward Bush's ranch.
About five miles from the ranch, they were met by the local police, who barred them from getting any closer.
Sheehan said she would remain as close as possible until Bush agreed to see her.
Later on Saturday afternoon, the two senior officials Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, and Joe Hagin, a deputy White House chief of staff went out to meet with Sheehan and several other protesters, said Trent D. Duffy, a spokesman for the White House.
They met for about 45 minutes, and Sheehan told the two men she appreciated their seeing her.
Her son, Spc. Casey A. Sheehan of the Army, a Humvee mechanic, was killed April 24, 2004, in Sadr City, Iraq.
He was 24.
As she walked through Crawford on Saturday, Sheehan carried pictures of him as a toddler and in his Army fatigues.
Before meeting with the officials, she told reporters, "I want to ask George Bush: Why did my son die?"
She said she was particularly upset by Bush's characterization, in a speech on Wednesday in Grapevine, Texas, of the war and the sacrifice of the families of fallen troops.
"Our men and women who have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan and in this war on terror have died in a noble cause, in a selfless cause," Bush said in the speech.
The confrontation came at the end of a particularly deadly week in Iraq for American troops, and at a time when polls have shown that public approval of Bush's handling of the war has reached new lows.
Cindy Sheehan's eyes well with tears when she talks about her oldest son, Casey, an easygoing young man with a quiet wit. Casey joined the Army in 2000, never imagining he would see combat.
Five days after he arrived in Iraq last year, the 24 year old was killed in Sadr City.
Sheehan knows nothing can bring back her son, but she wants to talk to President George W. Bush.
The California mother has been camping out along a road near his ranch since Saturday, vowing to remain until his Texas vacation ends later this month.
"Before my son was killed, I used to think that one person could not make a difference," she said Wednesday under a tent where she has slept since arriving.
"But one person that is surrounded and supported by millions of people can be heard."
Bush National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and a deputy White House chief of staff talked to Sheehan on Saturday.
She said the meeting, which she called "pointless," lasted 20 minutes.
The White House said it lasted 45 minutes.
By Thursday, about 50 people had joined her cause, pitching tents in muddy, shallow ditches and hanging anti war banners, two dozen others have sent flowers.
Her name was among the most popular search topics Wednesday on Internet blogs.
The soft spoken Sheehan, 48, is surprised and touched at the overwhelming response most of which is positive, she says.
But not everyone supports her.
Kristinn Taylor, co leader of the Washington, D.C., chapter of FreeRepublic.com, said Sheehan's protest is misguided and is hurting troop morale.
"She has a political agenda that goes way beyond her son's death in combat," said Taylor, whose conservative group has held pro troop rallies since the Sept 11, 2001, terror attacks and counter protests of anti war demonstrations.
Sheehan, a Catholic youth minister for eight years, never wanted Casey to join the military.
She said he did so after being misled by his recruiter.
Although he also opposed the war, he didn't try to back out.
"I begged him not to go," she said through tears.
"I said, 'I'll take you to Canada' ,but he said, 'Mom, I have to go.
It's my duty.
My buddies are going.'"
Sheehan has spent the past several days in rainy weather talking to scores of reporters, hugging fellow protesters and taking brief breaks to eat sandwiches and fruit brought by supporters.
She and her husband are separated, affected by the stress of losing their son.
But her three other children, ages 19 to 24, may join her in Crawford, she said.
Sheehan did meet with Bush in June 2004: She was among grieving military families who met with the president at Fort Lewis, Washington.
She has said her feelings have shifted from shock to anger since then, in part because of various reports that have disputed some of the Bush administration's justifications for the war.
Many supporters decided to go to Crawford because of rumors that Sheehan would be arrested.
But no protesters will be arrested unless they trespass on private property or block the road, said Capt. Kenneth Vanek of the McLennan County Sheriff's Office.
Trucker Craig Delaney, 53, was in Georgia on Monday when he heard numerous radio shows discussing Sheehan some criticizing her.
He altered his route to California, heading for Texas, and got to Sheehan's site Wednesday morning.
"I felt compelled to come and tell her I support her," said Delaney, a self described hippie from Sly Park, California.
"The way they were bad mouthing a mother whose son was killed in the war is un American."
Nearly 40 Democratic members of Congress have asked Bush to talk to her.
On Wednesday, a coalition of anti war groups in Washington also called on Bush to speak with Sheehan, who they say has helped to unify the peace movement.
"Cindy Sheehan has become the Rosa Parks of the anti war movement," said Rev. Lennox Yearwood, leader of the Hip Hop Caucus, an activist group.
"She's tired, fed up and she's not going to take it anymore, and so now we stand with her."
Earlier this year Sheehan formed Gold Star Families for Peace and has spoken to groups across the nation and overseas.
Judith Young, national president of the The American Gold Star Mothers of America Inc., said she is concerned the public will mistake her 76 year old Washington, D.C., nonprofit organization with Sheehan's group.
In Young's group, commonly known as Gold Star Moms, mothers whose children died in the line of duty volunteer in veterans' hospitals and programs.
Members don't do advocacy work, Young said.
Cindy Sheehan, the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq who has been camped outside President Bush's ranch near Crawford, Texas, has taken her antiwar protest to the Internet, joining a conference call with bloggers around the country, along with a stray congresswoman.
Sheehan, who has been demanding an audience with the president, told the bloggers that she has felt intimidated by the Secret Service, has been awakened in the middle of the night by thunderstorms and has a sore throat.
But, Sheehan said, she has no plans to end her vigil until Bush meets with her to discuss the war, he goes back to the White House or she is arrested.
"This is going to be a very, very long haul," Sheehan said in a call hosted by Democratic strategist and Internet guru Joe Trippi.
Trippi, who managed Howard Dean's presidential campaign, urged the bloggers to write about her protest on their individual sites.
The liberal online advocacy group MoveOn.org is also taking up Sheehan's cause, soliciting signatures for a petition in support of her cause and announcing plans to run an ad in the local paper, the Waco Tribune Herald.
Many of the bloggers on the call gushed over her protest ("We love you, Cindy") while Rep Jan Schakowsky, D Ill., also chimed in to express her support.
Sheehan, of Vacaville, Calif., earlier this week described her protest on the popular liberal blog Daily Kos, complaining that the mainstream news media have not paid enough attention to her cause, although she was interviewed Sunday on CNN's "Late Edition."
"If we didn't have the Internet, none of us would really know what was truly going on," she said.
"This is something that can't be ignored."
For more than a year, a modest bungalow known as "Peace House," located a few miles from President Bush's ranch, has served as a headquarters for antiwar activists.
It is lonely work, with little more than a skeleton crew on hand much of the time.
But then Cindy Sheehan hit town.
The 48 year old mother of Army Spc. Casey Sheehan, who was killed in an ambush in Baghdad, Iraq, last year, is consumed by the kind of grief that turns into a furious determination to do something in her case, to confront the president and force him to explain why her son died.
Now, in the space of just a few days, what started out as a seemingly quixotic personal mission has become something of a phenomenon with media swarming around Sheehan, leading liberal and antiwar activists parachuting in to try to make her their long sought voice, and political experts in both parties working to assess what role she may have in galvanizing the public's gathering unhappiness with the increasing American casualties in Iraq.
Antiwar leaders hope that putting the spotlight on Sheehan will motivate Americans who oppose the war, creating a political force strong enough to compel the Bush administration to change course.
MoveOn.org and other liberal groups have rushed to provide support, offering media expertise and attempting to assemble a corps of others who have lost relatives in Iraq or have family members serving there.
Liberal voices have swung into action on the Internet as well.
On Wednesday, Democratic media consultant Joe Trippi organized a conference call with Sheehan for bloggers, aiming to garner more publicity.
By Wednesday afternoon, "Cindy Sheehan" was the top ranked search term on Technorati.com, the search engine for blog postings.
The White House, meantime, has sought to cope with Sheehan's vigil without abandoning its strategy for dealing with the families of troops who have died.
On a number of occasions, Bush has met with bereaved relatives including some who have challenged him sharply on the war but he has done so privately, away from news cameras and reporters.
Sheehan, a Vacaville resident who opposed the war even before her son's death, was a member of one such group in June 2004.
She came away from that meeting dissatisfied and angry.
"We wanted (the president) to look at pictures of Casey, we wanted him to hear stories about Casey, and he wouldn't.
He changed the subject every time we tried," Sheehan said.
He wouldn't say Casey's name, called him: 'your loved one.'
" Sheehan, a co founder of the antiwar group Gold Star Families for Peace, has said that she will remain in Crawford until she gets to see Bush face to face.
Until a sudden cloudburst forced her to move to Peace House early Wednesday morning, Sheehan had been camping in a tent along a road about two miles from Bush's Prairie Chapel Ranch.
On Saturday, the day she arrived in Crawford, two senior White House aides national security adviser Stephen Hadley and deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin left the ranch to meet with her on a dusty road for 45 minutes.
That, she said, was not satisfactory.
By Wednesday night, Sheehan had given so many interviews that she was sucking on lozenges to soothe an inflamed throat.
Her ears were sore from cradling a telephone.
Her media adviser, newly arrived from San Francisco, said Sheehan had developed a fever.
None of that stopped her.
Whether talking to newspaper reporters, People magazine or radio and television interviewers some from as far away as Japan she was relentlessly on message.
"I don't believe his phony excuses for the war," she said of Bush in an interview with a CBS reporter for the network's northern California affiliates.
"I want him to tell me why my son died.
"If he gave the real answer, people in this country would be outraged if he told people it was to make his buddies rich, that it was about oil ," Sheehan is certainly not the first to denounce the president over the war.
From the beginning, activists have been outspoken in criticizing Bush's policy and his stated reasons for sending U.S. troops into Iraq.
For the moment however, the personal nature of Sheehan's protest with its edge of raw emotion and the concentration of news media staked out in Crawford, where Bush is spending much of August, have combined to raise her voice above the crowd.
"Anything that focuses media and public attention on Iraq war casualties day after day particularly (something) that is a good visual for television, like a weeping Gold Star mother is a really bad thing for President Bush and his administration," said independent political analyst Charlie Cook.
"Americans get a little numb by the numbers of war casualties, but when faces, names and families are added, it has a much greater effect," he said.
"Cindy Sheehan has tapped into a latent but fervent feeling among some in this country who would prefer that we not engage our troops in Iraq," said Republican strategist Kellyanne Conway, president of the Washington based firm The Polling Company.
"She can tap into what has been an astonishingly silent minority since the end of last year's presidential contest.
It will capture attention."
But other analysts predicted Sheehan would soon fade from the scene.
"The president has an Iraq problem, but I don't think it's much worsened by Mrs Sheehan," said Stephen Hess of George Washington University.
"One Gold Star mother is a sympathetic figure, but collectively as Gold Star Families for Peace she is a movement and, as such, can be countered by a counter movement.
"I think the president might have defused the situation if he had invited her in instantly," Hess said, predicting that GOP strategists would soon mount a counterattack.
Already, there were signs of just that.
Some have suggested that Sheehan is disloyal to criticize the president in time of war.
Even in Vacaville, Sheehan said, some people say she is shaming her son's memory.
Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin disdainfully called the activists promoting Sheehan "grief pimps."
The antiwar activists who have rushed to Sheehan's side are all too well aware of the danger that her moment in the spotlight could become just another partisan shouting match.
Said Tom Matzzie of MoveOn.org: "Cindy reached out to us.
We're e mailing our members about her story today, running a print ad in Waco (Texas).
Cindy is a morally pure voice on the war, so we're trying to keep the focus on her and not jump in and turn it into a political fight."
Since Sheehan arrived in Crawford, Peace House has been transformed into a beehive.
On the porch, bottles of water and a huge box of collapsible pink umbrellas were waiting Wednesday to be ferried out to "Camp Casey," the muddy staging area along Prairie Chapel Road where Sheehan and about 100 of her supporters were gathered.
On a table in the living room were stacks of white T shirts that read "BUSH ,Talk to Cindy!
Moms and Vets Will Stop the War!"
In the tiny kitchen, two women busily chopped carrots and celery as they prepared to feed a growing cadre of activists.
Other volunteers talked on their cellphones, coordinating with supporters around the country.
There was much speculation about "other moms" and parents of troops serving in the war coming to join Sheehan, although no one seemed to know for certain.
"A busload is coming from Seattle," one woman called out.
Stephanie Frizzell, 30, said she drove from Dallas with her son, Julian, 4, "to provide support for Cindy."
They met last weekend at a Dallas convention of veterans for peace.
According to Ann Wright, who identified herself as a former U.S. diplomat who resigned to protest the war, Sheehan seemed to make a spontaneous decision to come to Crawford when she was while addressing the convention Friday.
Wright said countless hands were raised, offering to join her mission.
As Sheehan put it Wednesday: "I just had the right idea in the right place at the right time."
Times staff writers Ronald Brownstein, Joel Havemann and Johanna Neuman in Washington contributed to this report.
The mother of a U.S. soldier killed in Iraq who started a quiet roadside peace vigil near President George Bush's ranch last weekend is drawing supporters from across the nation.
Dozens of people have joined her and others have sent flowers and food.
Cindy Sheehan, 48, of Vacaville, California, says she was surprised at the response.
"Before my son was killed, I used to think that one person could not make a difference," she said Wednesday under a tent where she has slept since Saturday.
"But one person that is surrounded and supported by millions of people can be heard."
But Kristinn Taylor, co leader of the Washington, D.C., chapter of FreeRepublic.com, which has held pro troop rallies, said Sheehan's actions are misguided and hurt troop morale.
"She has a political agenda that goes way beyond her son's death in combat," Taylor said.
Although a few residents have complained about the protesters, no one has been arrested because the group has been on the public right of way, said Capt. Kenneth Vanek of the McLennan County Sheriff's Office.
On Saturday, two high level Bush administration officials, the national security adviser and deputy White House chief of staff, talked to Sheehan for about 20 minutes.
Sheehan called the brief meeting "pointless" and still wants to talk to the president.
Her 24 year old son, Casey, was killed in Sadr City, Iraq, in April 2004 just five days after he arrived.
Two months later, Sheehan was among grieving military family members who met with Bush at Fort Lewis, near Seattle, Washington.
Since then, she said, various government and independent commission reports have disputed the Bush administration's claims that Saddam Hussein had mass killing chemical and biological weapons a main justification for the March 2003 invasion.
On Wednesday, a coalition of anti war groups in Washington called on Bush to speak with Sheehan, who they say has helped to unify the peace movement.
"Cindy Sheehan has become the Rosa Parks of the anti war movement," said Rev. Lennox Yearwood, leader of the Hip Hop Caucus, an activist group.
"She's tired, fed up and she's not going to take it anymore, and so now we stand with her."
Rosa Parks is the iconic civil rights figure who refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955.
Her arrest triggered one of the movement's earliest landmark events, a 381 day boycott of the bus system organized by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
At her makeshift camp in muddy ditches off the two lane, winding road leading to Bush's ranch, Sheehan has spent the past several days talking to reporters, hugging fellow protesters and taking brief breaks to eat sandwiches and fruit brought by supporters.
Her vigil has also become a hot topic on the Internet and blogs.
Although she doesn't expect Bush to meet with her in Crawford, she says if he did she would ask him whether he has encouraged his twin daughters to enlist.
"I want him to quit using my son's death to justify more killing," she said.
"The only way he can honor my son's death is to bring the troops home."
Sheehan, a former Roman Catholic youth minister, formed a group called Gold Star Families For Peace earlier this year and has spoken out against the war across the nation and overseas.
Two senior White House aides met here on Saturday with the angry mother of a fallen U.S. soldier, but they rejected Cindy Sheehan's demand for a direct accounting from President Bush for the way he has conducted the war in Iraq.
The surprise meeting, which lasted about 45 minutes, took place on a roadside several miles from the president's ranch, where federal and local law enforcement officials had halted Sheehan's advance toward the 1600 acre estate.
Bush is spending much of August on vacation at the ranch.
Sheehan, a 48 year old Vacaville, Calif., woman, was accompanied by more than 50 placard wielding anti war activists.
After police and Secret Service agents halted their march on a country lane, Sheehan and a half dozen die hard supporters stayed put while others turned back, trudging slowly down Prairie Chapel Road under the hot Central Texas sun.
In a telephone interview after her conversation with National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley and White House deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin, Sheehan said she would remain in Crawford and continue to seek a meeting with Bush.
"I didn't change my mind at all," she said.
"They said the president really believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction," Sheehan added.
"And I told them: 'I might be a grieving mom, but you men are very intelligent, and I know you don't believe what you're telling me."
Hadley and Hagin said they would relay her sentiments to the president, according to Sheehan.
Bush has met privately around the country with numerous family members of soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, but not with relatives who are overtly against the war.
"We mourn the loss of every life and Americans deeply appreciate those who have made the supreme sacrifice.
The way to honor that sacrifice is to complete the mission so that their lives were not lost in vain," said White House deputy press secretary Trent Duffy.
Sheehan's son, Casey, 24, was killed in the Sadr City section of Baghdad on April 4, 2004.
Afterward, she co founded Gold Star Families for Peace, an organization of people who have lost loved ones in Iraq or who oppose the war.
Previously, Sheehan was turned away while trying to protest the war at the Pentagon.
She told reporters here that she not only opposes the war but also strongly objects to Bush's assertions that fallen U.S. soldiers had died "for a noble cause."
"I don't want him to use my son's name, or my name, to justify any more killings.
And I want to tell the president that, and I want to ask the president why my son died," Sheehan said, contending that the war was "based on horrendous lies and deceptions."
Her meeting with two of Bush's top aides came amid a spike in U.S. casualties in Iraq, accompanied by sagging public support for the president's conduct of the war.
A Newsweek poll released on Saturday found that 61 percent of Americans now disapprove of Bush's handling of the war while 34 percent approve.
This is Bush's lowest approval rating on Iraq and the first time that it has dropped below 40 percent in the Newsweek Poll, the magazine said.
Half of those polled said the United States is losing ground in its efforts to establish security and democracy in Iraq while 40 percent said the United States is making progress there.
U.S. President George W. Bush was meeting with his defense and foreign policy teams Thursday at his Texas ranch, from where he'll look at world hotspots from Baghdad to Pyongyang.
Vice President Dick Cheney and top rung advisers, including Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, were coming for the serious talks about issues ranging from ongoing violence in Iraq and standoffs with Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs to anti American sentiment abroad, especially in the Middle East.
Keeping with tradition, Bush is spending August at the ranch in Crawford.
The unhurried pace of this one stoplight town stands in sharp contrast to events across the globe: suicide bombings in Iraq, on again, off again negotiations with the reclusive North Korea, Iran's decision to restart sensitive nuclear work, next week's pullout of some 9000 Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
Bush's update on defense and foreign policy issues comes at a time when his approval ratings are hovering below 50 percent.
An AP Ipsos poll conducted Aug 1 3 showed Bush's overall job approval was at 42 percent, with 55 percent disapproving.
That's about where his approval rating has been all summer, but slightly lower than it was when the year began.
His approval on his handling of Iraq stood at 38 percent.
Iraq, where the death toll of U.S. troops has topped 1840, is likely to take a center stage.
The administration is hoping that progress on the political front will help deflate violence and allow the United States and its partners to begin withdrawing troops next year.
Rumsfeld said success in drafting a new Iraqi constitution is critical toward persuading the majority of Iraqis that the "new Iraq is worth fighting for."
But a deadlock has arisen over the drafting of the charter, which is supposed to be completed by Monday.
Cindy Sheehan, a California mother of a fallen soldier, is holding a roadside protest to bring the troops home.
So far, Rumsfeld has not publicly voiced his thoughts on when U.S. forces may be able to come home in large numbers a decision that hinges on the level of violence and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces, which now number 178000.
A joint U.S. Iraqi committee that is identifying areas to revert to Iraqi control will submit its final report by the end of September.
That is the first step toward what Gen. George W. Casey, the top commander in Iraq, has said could lead to a "fairly substantial" reduction in the 138000 strong U.S. force by the spring and summer of next year.
Casey has not disclosed numbers, but Pentagon officials have mentioned a reduction figure of 20000 to 30000 troops.
That would still leave about 100000 Americans in Iraq well into next year.
But first the Pentagon will likely have to increase the number of U.S. troops above the current 138000 to improve security for a planned October referendum and a December election, when a burst of insurgent violence is expected, Rumsfeld spokesman Lawrence Di Rita said this week.
In January, when Iraq held its first elections, troop levels were raised as high as 160000, mainly by overlapping some units arriving in Iraq to begin a one year tour with those who were ending their yearlong tours.
Di Rita said that this time commanders could also ask for volunteers to serve extended tours or send some U.S. based troops to Iraq to augment the force during the fall election period.
The White House says Rumsfeld will brief the president on the Quadrennial Defense Review, a congressionally mandated top to bottom review of defense strategy and plans.
The review, begun earlier this year, will be completed around January, in time for the February budget submission.
As a roadside anti war vigil initiated by a California woman who lost a son in Iraq continued near his ranch Thursday, President Bush said that he sympathizes with her loss but that agreeing to her demand to immediately withdraw troops "would be a mistake for the security of this country."
Speaking to reporters after meeting with members of his national security team, Bush said he has heard the voices of Cindy Sheehan and grieving family members who say the United States should leave Iraq because of the mounting death toll.
"I grieve for every death," Bush said.
"It breaks my heart to think about a family weeping over the loss of a loved one.
I understand the anguish that some feel about the death that takes place."
Nonetheless, Bush added, withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq before that nation's security forces are able to cope with the ongoing insurgency "would send a terrible signal to the enemy," that the United States is weak and easily intimidated While Bush met with Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to discuss the war and other foreign policy concerns, a growing clutch of protesters were encamped along the muddy shoulder of the narrow, winding road leading to Bush's 1600 acre ranch.
Sheehan, who began her vigil Saturday, has been joined by several dozen protesters from across the country, including some others who have had loved ones killed in Iraq.
"The president says he feels compassion for me, but the best way to show that compassion is by meeting with me and the other mothers and families who are here," Sheehan said.
"Our sons made the ultimate sacrifice and we want answers.
All we're asking is that he sacrifice an hour out of his five week vacation to talk to us, before the next mother loses her son in Iraq."
Celeste Zappala of Philadelphia, said her son, Sgt. Sherwood Baker, was killed in Baghdad while looking for nonexistent weapons of mass destruction.
"This war is a disaster," Zappala said.
"It is a betrayal of our military.
It is a betrayal of our democracy."
The protesters have strung placards along the roadside saying things such as, "Who would Jesus bomb?" and "Who lied?
Who died?
Who paid?
Who profits?"
They also drove dozens of small, white wooden crosses into the ground along the road, in honor of those killed in Iraq.
Sheehan's son, Casey Sheehan, 24, a former Eagle Scout and altar boy, was killed in Baghdad on April 4, 2004, within a week of arriving in Iraq.
Sheehan met Bush two months later, as part of a group of grieving military family members.
She has alleged that Bush treated her callously during their private conversation, and she has demanded a second meeting to air her grievances about the war and to tell Bush about the devastation she has felt since losing her son.
In the wake of her son's death, Sheehan, 48, co founded Gold Star Families for Peace, an organization of people who have lost loved ones in Iraq or who oppose the war.
Although she met Saturday with two top Bush aides, Sheehan has vowed to maintain her vigil both here and, if necessary, outside the White House until she is granted another meeting with the president.
Sheehan's protest has created a delicate situation for the White House, which has resisted being drawn into a public battle with a woman who lost a son in Iraq.
While officials would not publicly refute Sheehan's description of her meeting with Bush, they did point out that the president has met with about 900 family members of 272 fallen soldiers sessions they describe as often emotional and moving.
The mother of a fallen U.S. soldier who is holding a roadside peace vigil near President George W. Bush's ranch shares the same grief as relatives mourning the deaths of Ohio Marines, yet their views about the war differ.
"I'm angry.
I want the troops home," Cindy Sheehan, 48, of California, who staged a protest that she vowed on Sunday to continue until she can personally ask Bush: "Why did you kill my son?
What did my son die for?"
Jim Boskovitch, father of slain Cpl. Jeffery Boskovitch, 25, of Ohio, is supporting the U.S. military action in Iraq.
"I firmly believe, and I would echo my son's feeling on this, it is very, very important for our country to remain steadfast and complete the mission that they set out to accomplish," Boskovitch told ABC on Sunday.
Boskovitch is among several families mourning Ohio Marines who suffered heavy losses in three attacks starting July 28, when two were killed in a gun battle.
On Monday, five were killed in an ambush.
Nine were killed Wednesday when an armored vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb.
Rosemary Palmer, the mother of Lance Cpl. Edward Schroeder, 23, another Ohio Marine killed in Iraq, sided more with Sheehan.
If the United States continues its current course in Iraq, the death toll of U.S. troops, now at more than 1820, will only grow, she told ABC.
"We either have to have more people there to do the job and better equipment, or we have to leave one or the other," she said.
Boskovitch said his son, Jeff, "felt extremely, extremely strongly about the Iraqi people and our government deciding to go over there."
"His commander in chief needed him to be there, as well as those fellow soldiers, to help those people, help that country to be able to stand on its own and to liberate those people," Boskovitch told ABC.
Sheehan was among grieving military families who met with Bush in June 2004 at Fort Lewis, near Seattle, Washington.
That was just two months after her son, Casey, was killed in Sadr City, Iraq, on April 4, 2004.
Since then, she said, various government and independent commission reports have disputed the Bush administration's claims that Saddam Hussein had mass killing chemical and biological weapons a main justification for the March 2003 invasion.
"I was still in shock then," Sheehan said in a telephone interview.
"All of those reports prove my son died needlessly," said Sheehan.
"This proved that every reason George Bush gave us for going to war was wrong."
Sheehan, who formed a group called Gold Star Families For Peace and has spoken out against the war across the nation, talked for about 45 minutes on Saturday with Steve Hadley, Bush's national security adviser, and Joe Hagin, deputy White House chief of staff, who went out to hear her concerns.
Appreciative of their attention, yet undaunted, Sheehan said she planned to continue her protest along the road during Bush's stay through the end of the month.
"If he doesn't come out and talk to me in Crawford, I'll follow him to D.C.," she said.
"I'll camp on his lawn in D.C. until he has the courtesy and the integrity and the compassion to talk to somebody whose life he has ruined."
One of President George W. Bush's neighbors will allow use of his land by dozens of war protesters who have camped in roadside ditches the past 11 days, giving them more room and halving their distance from Bush's ranch.
Fred Mattlage, an Army veteran, said he sympathizes with the demonstrators whose makeshift camp off the winding, two lane road leading to Bush's ranch has angered most residents.
Mattlage said the group will be safer on his corner 1 acre lot (0.4 hectare).
"I just think people should have a right to protest without being harassed," Mattlage told The Associated Press Tuesday night.
"And I'm against the war.
I don't think it's a war we need to be in."
Cindy Sheehan of Vacaville, California, started the vigil Aug 6 to honor her son Casey, who was killed in Iraq last year.
Sheehan has vowed to remain through Bush's monthlong ranch visit unless he meets with her and other grieving families.
Mattlage's Monday night offer, accepted by protesters Tuesday, will put them about a mile from Bush's ranch, said Hadi Jawad of the Crawford Peace House, which is helping the group.
Demonstrators said they would start moving their tents, anti war banners and portable toilets to the new site Wednesday and hope to have the new camp set up in time for a dusk candlelight vigil.
The vigil will be one of about 1000 to be held across the country, an effort organized by liberal advocacy groups MoveOn.org Political Action, TrueMajority and Democracy for America.
Larry Mattlage, a distant cousin of Mattlage's who owns nearby land, fired a shotgun twice into the air Sunday but no one was injured.
But Fred Mattlage does not share his cousin's frustrations with the group.
For more than a week, the rural area has been a traffic nightmare as the camp attracted hundreds more protesters as well as Bush supporters holding counter rallies.
A resident was arrested Monday night after authorities say he ran over hundreds of small wooden crosses bearing names of fallen U.S. soldiers.
Tuesday morning, several landowners asked county commissioners to extend for at least two miles (3.2 kilometers) the public "no parking" zone around Bush's ranch.
The ordinance now prohibits cars from stopping on the road within about a quarter of a mile.
Bush, who said he sympathizes with Sheehan, has made no indication that he will meet with her.
Sheehan and other families met with Bush two months after her son's death before she became a vocal opponent of the war.
Undaunted by counter rallies and even a neighbor's gunshot blasts into the air, a woman whose son died in Iraq said she will continue her anti war demonstration near President George W. Bush's ranch for three more weeks.
"We can't give up, no matter hard it gets," Cindy Sheehan said Sunday.
She started the protest Aug 6 in memory of her 24 year old son Casey, an Army specialist killed in Iraq last year.
Her makeshift campsite along the road leading to the Western White House has grown to more than 100, and hundreds more have stopped by for a few hours to show their support.
Sheehan says she won't leave "Camp Casey" until Bush meets with her and other grieving families or until his monthlong ranch visit ends.
More than 350 war protesters rallied at the site Saturday afternoon, hours after some 250 Bush supporters waved American flags in a counter rally across the street, holding signs that said Sheehan was unpatriotic and was hurting troop morale.
While about 60 in Sheehan's group held a religious service Sunday morning, a nearby landowner, Larry Mattlage, fired his shotgun twice into the air.
Sheriff's deputies and Secret Service agents rushed to his house but did not arrest him.
"I ain't threatening nobody, and I ain't pointing a gun at nobody," Mattlage said.
"This is Texas."
Mattlage said he was initially sympathetic toward the demonstrators, but that they have blocked roads in the area and caused traffic problems.
He said he fired his gun in preparation for the dove hunting season, but when asked if he had another motive, he said, "Figure it out for yourself."
Sheriff's deputies have kept a presence at the demonstrators' site, and more than a dozen law enforcement cars flanked the edge of the camp Saturday to keep them and the pro Bush rally separated.
A few from each side got into heated verbal exchanges, but no one was arrested.
Sheehan, 48, of Vacaville, California, said she was not concerned with her own safety but that she has told others to be aware that "this could get physical, even though we are peaceful."
"I think we knew of the risks when we came down here," she said.
"I'm surprised we haven't had more of that since we're in Bush country."
Sheehan, who met with two top Bush administration officials on her first day of the protest, said some of her supporters have left the campsite but that others keep arriving from around the country.
Bush has said he sympathizes with Sheehan but has not said if he will meet with her.
Sherry Bohlen of Scottsdale, Arizona, drove with two friends to Crawford last week but didn't leave Sunday as planned.
"This is history in the making, and it's hard to walk away from that," said Bohlen, whose son Thor has been in Iraq for a month.
Cindy Sheehan, the grieving and hustling mother who has stalked President Bush to his sagebrush getaway, has acquired public relations advisers, no less.
The acquisition seems superfluous.
Sheehan herself could hire out as a PR consultant.
Experience pays off.
Sheehan had been working her way across the country with little to show, beyond the old anti war fan base, for her effort to stir up righteous opposition to the president's war.
Then she hit on the idea of staking out the road to Bush's ranch.
Brilliant.
Reporters who are doomed to follow presidents to their vacation hidey holes are a forlorn lot, and the more so when the spot, like Crawford, Texas, is miles from any restaurant worthy of the adjective "expense account."
The news is usually sparse to nonexistent and the journalists find themselves turning out for briefings at which some third assistant press secretary cheerily announces that the president is enjoying himself and, far from neglecting business, has congratulated the just crowned Kansas Corn Queen.
So into this bog of sloth and ennui drops Cindy Sheehan.
You can count on it that even the most stridently secular journalists were thanking God.
Even so, the manna was taken up only slowly.
For the first few days, displaying all the vigor that has marked them during the Bush presidency, the media took only gingerly notice.
But ultimately the Great American News Machine is right up there with nature in abhorring a vacuum.
Feature stories about Sheehan, her son and his service, and about the branch of the family that doesn't cotton to her protest, began appearing.
They drew a slow accretion of the like minded to Sheehan's standard.
Sheehan's own small Gold Star Families for Peace was joined by the women's anti war outfit, CodePink, and by TrueMajority, the political arm of Ben and Jerry's ice cream.
And Sheehan got on the horn to the bloggers.
With activist free booters trickling in, before you knew it the media had a genuine pseudo event on their hands and since have been going to town on the story.
As you'd expect, this has the political right indignant, as it is these days at just about everything.
Conservatives claim the whole business has been blown out of proportion by the ever plotting liberal media, who are of course out to get Bush.
Public opinion has turned against the war, but the change has carried no great anti war excitement.
The public has maintained considerable poise, given the provocation of a war disingenuously huckstered, ineptly planned and increasingly pricey in life, limb and treasure.
Bush's wan gesture of sympathy to Sheehan flopped.
He has since hunkered down, and now the motorcades in and out of the ranch have taken to whizzing past the rankling encampment.
A blur is apparently the next best thing to out of sight, out of mind.
Is Bush discomfited?
His supporters complain that he is, but so what?
Discomfiture is small enough rebuke, when you consider what he has gotten us into.
Cindy Sheehan isn't going to bring anti war mobs boiling into the streets, but if she gives our oft proclaimed "war president" a sleepless night or two, it's hard to see how that would be a bad thing.

CRAWFORD, Texas President Bush, noting that lots of people want to talk to the president and "it's also important for me to go on with my life," on Saturday defended his decision not to meet with the grieving mom of a soldier killed in Iraq.
Bush said he is aware of the anti war sentiments of Cindy Sheehan and others who have joined her protest near the Bush ranch.
"But whether it be here or in Washington or anywhere else, there's somebody who has got something to say to the president, that's part of the job," Bush said on the ranch.
"And I think it's important for me to be thoughtful and sensitive to those who have got something to say."
"But," he added, "I think it's also important for me to go on with my life, to keep a balanced life."
The comments came prior to a bike ride on the ranch with journalists and aides.
It also came as the crowd of protesters grew in support of Sheehan, the California mother who came here Aug 6 demanding to talk to Bush about the death of her son Casey.
Sheehan arrived earlier in the week with about a half dozen supporters.
As of yesterday (Saturday) there were about 300 anti war protestors and approximately 100 people supporting the Bush Administration.
Sheehan is seeking a justification for the war, as well as her son's death.
"I don't want comfort from him," she said Friday.
""I want answers.
I want the truth."
Bush on Saturday said, "I've heard their complaints about my policy.
I think it would be a big mistake to withdraw immediately from Iraq, which is what they're suggesting we do."
In addition to the two hour bike ride, Bush's Saturday schedule included an evening Little League Baseball playoff game, a lunch meeting with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, a nap, some fishing and some reading.
"I think the people want the president to be in a position to make good, crisp decisions and to stay healthy," he said when asked about bike riding while a grieving mom wanted to speak with him.
"And part of my being is to be outside exercising."
"So I'm mindful of what goes on around me," Bush added.
"On the other hand, I'm also mindful that I've got a life to live and will do so."
On Friday, Bush's motorcade drove by the protest site en route to a Republican fund raising event at a nearby ranch.
As Bush rolled by, Sheehan held a sign that said, "Why do you make time for donors and not for me?"
Later Friday, more than 100 supporters of Bush led by Mike Gallagher, a radio talk show host, showed up at the protest site to show their support for his Iraq policy.
On Saturday, authorities kept the two groups separated.
Bush on Saturday also defended his Iraq policy in his weekly radio address, saying the war is going well.
"Iraqis are taking control of their country, building a free nation that can govern itself, sustain itself and defense itself," he said.
"And we're helping Iraqis succeed."
The following are major news items in leading US newspapers on Saturday: The New York Times: Through last Monday, the average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline in the United States had risen nearly 26 percent in 12 months, with the sharpest rise 17 percent in just the last two months.
Strike at British Airways that stranded tens of thousands of travelers at Heathrow Airport in London ended on Friday but fliers might be struck a few more days as the airline struggles to recover.
The Washington Post: The antiwar protest of Cindy sheehan, a mother of a dead soldier in Iraq, established a base along the road to President Bush's ranch near Crawford, Texas.
The Israeli military will begin in two days the first evacuation of Jewish settlements since the Sinai pullout, abandoning 21 settlements in the Gaza Strip and the network of military installations that protected them for nearly four decades.
The husband of Cindy Sheehan, the mother camped outside President George Bush's Texas ranch to protest the death of a son in the Iraq war, has filed for divorce, according to court documents.
Patrick Sheehan filed the divorce petition Friday in Solano County court, northeast of San Francisco.
His lawyer did not immediately return a call seeking comment Monday.
The couple's eldest child, Casey, 24, was an Army soldier killed in April 2004.
Cindy Sheehan has said the stress of the death led to the separation of the couple, who were high school sweethearts.
Sheehan has vowed to remain in Texas through Bush's August vacation, unless he meets with her.
She began her protest 10 days ago and has since been joined by more than 100 anti war activists.
"Our message is to bring the troops home," Sheehan said Monday.
The White House on Monday again issued a statement saying that Bush sympathizes with Sheehan.
The president has given no indication that he will meet with her.
Sheehan, 48, and other grieving military families met with Bush in June 2004 at Fort Lewis, near Seattle, two months after her son's death.
But she says the meeting was unsatisfactory, and it came before reports surfaced about faulty pre war intelligence, which enraged her.
Cindy Sheehan rode into town 10 days ago, a forlorn mother with a penetrating question for her president: Why did my son die in Iraq?
But now the same wave of publicity and political anger that she rode to become a nationally known symbol of the antiwar movement threatens to crash down on Sheehan herself.
Conservative commentators and Web sites are taking aim at Sheehan with the same ferocity she has aimed at President Bush.
In part, they are using her own words as ammunition against her reciting such controversial comments as her vow to refuse pay taxes to a government waging an "illegal" war and her desire to see Bush impeached.
The backlash is becoming a new object lesson in how saturation media coverage and the instinct for personal attack are shaping political debate.
Some independent commentators said the pushback on the right had succeeded in part at scuffing the public sympathy and deference she had earned as the mother of a fallen soldier, and shown how virtually any subject relating to the Iraq war and Bush's presidency is viewed through a partisan lens.
"Cindy Sheehan has emboldened the progressives who oppose the war and caused the conservative die hards who are behind the war to go into a defensive mode," said Michael Harrison, publisher of Talkers magazine, a trade publication for talk radio.
"Cindy Sheehan is going to be a target, and they'll probably go through her past to find what they can to discredit her."
Since her son, Casey, 24, was killed in Iraq last year, Sheehan has traveled the country trying to drum up opposition to the war in Iraq.
She has participated in peace conferences, demonstrations and a mock congressional hearing about the infamous Downing Street memo, notes of a meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his top advisers that said the Bush administration had decided to go to war and molded intelligence findings to support that decision.
In that time, Sheehan, 48, a soft spoken woman who says she was radicalized by her son's death, has engaged in her fair share of inflammatory rhetoric.
"It's obvious Cindy Sheehan has become a political player, whose primary concern is embarrassing the president," Fox Television personality Bill O'Reilly wrote Tuesday in an online column.
"She is no longer just a protester."
Bush, Sheehan said, lied to the American people about the war and should be impeached.
And she is refusing to pay taxes in hopes that the Internal Revenue Service will come after her to collect.
"I'm not supporting a government that wages an illegal, immoral war," she said.
"I want them to come after me, so I can put the war on trial."
Still, she called some of the statements attributed to her distortions.
Contrary to a letter attributed to her that is circulating widely on the Internet, she claims she never said that the United States is waging the war in Iraq to protect Israel.
"I have said a lot of strong things, and I'll stand by everything I said," Sheehan said, adding that she thought the document had been altered.
"But I didn't say that."
The scrutiny that has accompanied Sheehan's quick rise to prominence has extended to her family.
Several of her in laws have publicly criticized her protest announcing their displeasure in a release to the Drudge Report.
And news that Sheehan's husband, Patrick, has filed for divorce has been trumpeted by some bloggers as evidence of her extreme views.
Sheehan acknowledges that that some of her views are becoming a distraction.
Also, she said, some of the groups that have aided her protest have agendas including conspiracy theories about the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and some vaguely anti Semitic theories about the cause of the war that she says she does not share.
Consequently, she has asked that her camp site near Bush's ranch be restricted only to organizations of military families, or those that have lost loved ones in the war.
"Attention got focused on the messenger and not the message," Sheehan said.
"My thing is ending the war in Iraq.
But there are a lot of people who want to attach their horse to my wagon because of the exposure I'm getting."
The increased scrutiny of Sheehan is coming as some residents here are growing irritated with the stream of antiwar protesters drawn to her vigil.
A spokeswoman for Sheehan Tuesday announced plans to move the camp from the drainage ditches next to the winding road about two miles from Bush's 1600 acre spread to a field on a ranch offered by one of Bush's neighbors.
The new camp would be about a mile from Bush's ranch.
All that would be left behind at the original site would be three tents and hundreds of white, wooden crosses bearing the names of troops killed in Iraq.
The move followed complaints by about 60 of Bush's neighbors, who petitioned the county to expand a no parking zone around the camp, in an effort to avert the traffic tie ups that have become commonplace as the protest has grown.
Also, Monday night a truck dragging chains and a pipe demolished some of the crosses.
Sheehan has promised to remain encamped throughout Bush's five week stay here and to return whenever the president does.
She also announced plans for a series of nearly 1000 candlelight vigils nationwide on Wednesday night.
Liberal advocacy groups MoveOn.org Political Action and Democracy for America are organizing the protests.
"All of this other b.s. just clouds my message," Sheehan said.
"My message is that of a brokenhearted mom sitting down in front of George Bush's ranch wanting to know why my son died."
Two women, both of whom have lost children, are out to change government policy.
Can they succeed?
Should they succeed?
The two women are Beth Holloway Twitty and Cindy Sheehan.
Twitty's daughter, Natalee Holloway, went missing in Aruba in May.
Sheehan lost her son, Casey, in Iraq last year.
Both women have proved savvy in using the media.
And, although we must sympathize with both, we must also consider the impact of their efforts on the institutions that have been created to deal with problems of law and war.
Twitty believes that Aruban authorities are not working energetically and competently to find out what happened to her daughter.
In taking her case to the public, she has enlisted much of the media, particularly cable news.
Yet, while many have criticized TV's infatuation with the Case of Yet Another Pretty White Girl, a deeper point needs to be remembered: the importance of victims' rights.
For decades, even as the crime rate soared, the legal and popular culture chose to dwell on the sympathetic side of criminals that they, too, were victims of a racist and unjust society.
Finally, law abiding Middle America said, "Enough!"
In the last two decades, tragic events have propelled such new figures as John "America's Most Wanted" Walsh into rightful prominence.
Politicians have responded to this cultural shift by toughening laws, hiring more cops and increasing prison sentences.
Yet there's obviously still more work to be done.
The recent case of Joseph Edward Duncan charged with triple homicide and abduction of an 8 year old girl demonstrates that the revolving door still spins out of control.
Duncan was legally deemed a sexual psychopath in 1980.
Yet, for much of the last quarter century, he has been out of jail, free to do who knows what.
It's apparent that even today many officials still calculate that it's not really worth worrying about catching criminals and keeping them caught.
By this reckoning, the Natalie Holloway case should not be seen as the opportunity to exploit the memory of a telegenic blonde, but rather to change the lenient professional calculus of cops, judges and parole boards.
Cindy Sheehan, too, wishes to use the media for her cause, getting the United States out of Iraq.
After stumping the country for months in obscurity, she hit upon a media friendly stratagem.
She camped outside George W. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, where bored reporters were eager for a lively story.
It's Sheehan's right to protest, and most likely her efforts will increase opposition to the war, every movement, to be effective in the media age, needs a face.
And now the anti war movement has its face.
But it's worth pausing over the one specific request Sheehan has made: that the president meet with her to talk about Iraq.
Were Bush to do so, it would set a bad precedent.
Without regard to the merits of this particular war, a president should not be media blackmailed into such a meeting.
During World War II, some 400000 Americans were killed, and so should President Franklin D. Roosevelt have met with each one of those families?
In wartime, we need a commander in chief, not a consoler in chief or a debater in chief.
It's possible that Bush policies will be overturned at the ballot box in the coming elections.
If so, that would be an example of the system responding legitimately to public pressure.
What connects Twitty and Sheehan is that they want to make change.
What will validate their efforts permanently is if they make change that strengthens useful institutions as opposed to weakening them.
That means forcing the criminal justice system to do its job, on the one hand, while leaving Bush and the electorate to do their jobs on the other.
Cindy Sheehan, the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq who has set up a vigil near President Bush's ranch, said Tuesday that she was "very disturbed" that a local resident had mowed down hundreds of small crosses bearing the names of other dead American soldiers.
Further, Sheehan promised that her 10 day old protest was "only the beginning" of what she called a growing national movement to bring all American men and women home from the war.
Camp Casey, Sheehan's increasingly crowded roadside encampment named after her son, will soon move to a large property even closer to the president's ranch, she said.
"A kind gentleman from down the road offered us the use of his property," Sheehan told reporters Tuesday night.
She identified the man as Fred Mattlage, whom she described as a distant cousin of Larry Mattlage, a local resident who fired a shotgun across the road from the encampment on Sunday afternoon.
Sheehan said the property, near a Secret Service checkpoint about a mile from Bush's ranch, would have plenty of space for the parked cars that have jammed the roadside, irritating local residents.
Fred Mattlage could not be reached on Tuesday to confirm Sheehan's account.
In the meantime, a group of Bush's neighbors appeared before the McLennan County Commission on Tuesday morning asking that a no parking zone near the president's ranch be expanded, effectively forcing Camp Casey to move to the town of Crawford, seven miles away.
Neighbors have complained of traffic jams and blocked roads, and some said they worried about the safety of their children, who started school on Tuesday.
On Monday night, the police arrested a local resident who had used a truck to mow down about half of the 500 small wooden crosses hammered into the roadside dirt.
Sheehan's supporters put the crosses back in place on Tuesday morning.
"What happened last night is very disturbing to all of us, and it should be really disturbing to America," Sheehan said in a news conference at Camp Casey on Tuesday morning.
"Because no matter what you think about the war, we should all honor the sacrifice of the ones who have fallen.
And to me it's so ironic that I'm accused of dishonoring my son's memory by doing what I'm doing, by the other side, and then somebody comes and does this."
Sheehan, who has vowed not to leave until Bush comes off his ranch and speaks to her, said that if local residents wanted her to leave, "they should talk to their neighbor, George Bush, and tell him to talk to us."
Bush did meet with Sheehan in June 2004, but she has said that the president was disrespectful to her by referring to her as "Mom" throughout the meeting.
Bush has since said he is sympathetic to Sheehan, 48, of Vacaville, Calif., whose son, an Army specialist, was killed at 24 in Baghdad on April 4, 2004.
On Tuesday a White House spokeswoman, Dana Perino, said that while the president disagreed with Sheehan's views, "he says he respects her right to peacefully protest."
Sheehan's supporters said they had planned nearly 1000 anti war vigils across the country on Wednesday night.
Barbara Cummings was home in San Diego last Monday, listening to an Air America radio broadcast, when she heard the tale of a woman who was coming here to join Cindy Sheehan in her growing protest against the war in Iraq.
The woman on the radio had a son who had signed on for a second tour of duty in the Army after losing his job.
In two weeks, he is scheduled to ship out to Iraq.
Cummings jumped on the phone and called her friend, Gloria Polk.
"I asked her, 'Are you following the Cindy Sheehan story?'
And she was."
The next day, the two retirees hopped in a rented minivan for the 22 hour drive to the heart of Texas.
Saturday, Cummings found herself in front of the Crawford Peace House, a gathering place for protesters, holding a hand lettered sign.
She was directing a stream of cars descending on this normally sleepy town to a dirt parking lot adjacent to a nearby high school football field.
Polk, meanwhile, was at the wheel of her blue Dodge Caravan, shuttling protesters up to the roadside campsite near President Bush's 1600 acre ranch where Sheehan has been holding her defiant vigil for more than a week.
"We're both here because of our grandchildren," Cummings explained.
"It feels like a word of mouth thing.
Everybody I meet is saying they had to be here."
While the antiwar activists buzzed around the Peace House preparing for a scheduled rally, more than 150 flag waving marchers made their way toward Sheehan's camp to show their support for the war.
Also, a lone demonstrator drove a pickup truck blaring country music with a large American flag flying from its bed.
A sign on his door read: "Texas Is Bush Country."
James Vergauwen and his wife, Wynell, preferred to stay put next to their Harley to make their point.
"I'm just here to let the president and the troops know that there are people here who do support them," said James Vergauwen, who wore a cap emblazoned "The price of freedom is not free."
"I don't agree with the president about everything.
I just wish Cindy Sheehan could spend one hour in the president's shoes making tough decisions."
Several hundred antiwar protesters converged on Crawford this weekend, and many of them had similar stories.
They believe that Sheehan, a 48 year old mother from Vacaville, Calif., whose son was killed in Iraq last year, has magically ignited a struggling peace movement with her quiet, but defiant protest.
"It's just a miracle what's going on here," said Bill Mitchell, who lost his son, Michael, in Iraq on April 4, 2004 the same day that Sheehan's son, Casey, was killed.
Along with Sheehan, he has protested the war for more than a year and helped organize other military families in support of their cause.
But often it seemed that no one cared.
"We've worked so long and hard to get our message out," he said.
Ray McGovern, a former intelligence official turned antiwar activist, came down from Virginia to support Sheehan.
"I think Cindy has lit a spark where Americans can identify with the human costs of the war," he said.
While Sheehan's protest has received the aid of public relations pros, political operatives and even a television spot since it started a week ago Saturday, many of the people drawn here said it was because of her simple but compelling story.
Sheehan is the grieving mother of a fallen soldier and she wants the president to explain to her why.
"I'm here just to support this lady and show there is support for getting out of Iraq and stopping this maniac from doing what he is doing," said Lawrence Reuben, a Vietnam veteran and a helicopter technician, from nearby Benton, Texas.
"Why can't the president just stop and talk to the woman and say, 'Lady, I know where you're coming from.
This war is not going the way I intended.'
" At the Peace House, a small wood frame cottage just across the railroad tracks from this town's only traffic signal, things were humming.
Outside, the parents of fallen soldiers were doing interviews with reporters while volunteers prepared signs, sold T shirts and buttons and offered food and water to protesters.
Before Sheehan's arrival, the house, established in 2003 by Dallas peace activists, had $121 in the bank and its phone cut off because of overdue bills.
But once word of Sheehan's protest took flight, money began to flow in.
A woman from Italy paid for a large party tent, coolers and a generator.
Other strangers sent checks and made deposits directly into the group's PayPal account.
In one week, the house has amassed enough money to pay off its $40000 mortgage.
"I've been walking around with my mouth open and in a daze for the past two or three days," said Kay Lucas, the Peace House director.
"It's a blessing, a miracle.
It's like the parable of the loaves and the fishes.
The money and the phone calls and the letters of support have all been phenomenal."
Lucas said that the staff of the Peace House sent an e mail to Sheehan once they learned that she planned to come to Crawford.
Since her arrival, the house has been a sanctuary, a place for Sheehan and other protesters to take a nap, a shower or a break from the roadside camp.
At Camp Casey, the name given to Sheehan's encampment, a caravan of cars drove by her as she stood wearing a straw hat in the blazing sun, fighting back tears as she acknowledged her supporters.
She wore a T shirt bearing her dead son's picture.
On her left ankle was a small tattoo that read: Casey '79 04.
Before long, she climbed onto the back of a pickup truck to address her supporters, who applauded loudly.
She smiled humbly but her words were uncompromising.
"Who knew that the beginning of the end of the occupation of Iraq was going to start in Crawford, Texas, last Saturday?" she said.
"Who knew that America would finally stand up and say we're sick and tired of this (expletive)?
Bring our troops home."
Monday's announcement that Apple Computer Inc. will use Intel Corp. chips in its PCs made the Mac faithful think: different.
After weeks of rumors and speculation, Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs told software engineers at the company's annual developer conference that Intel microprocessors would power Macintosh computers beginning next year, with Intel inside all Apple computers by 2007.
The move ends a long and sometimes stormy relationship between Apple and IBM Corp., which builds the Mac's current PowerPC chips, and Motorola Inc., which makes chips for Apple laptops.
Intel supplies most of the chips that power PCs running the Windows operating system of Apple archrival Microsoft Corp.
So closely aligned are Microsoft and Intel that they often are referred to as Wintel.
So to some of Apple's Macolytes, the new alliance portended something sinister for the Cupertino based company that has leveraged the success of its iPod portable music players to boost sales of its stylish but pricey PCs.
"Where does this lead us?"
Jobs asked from the stage.
Before Jobs could answer himself, someone in the audience cracked: "Down the road to hell."
Despite sentiments like that, computer industry analysts and many Mac users discounted the long term effects of the change, saying Apple has built its reputation on software and design rather than the raw computing power of its machines.
By switching to Intel, they said, Apple may be able to cut prices on its computers and compete more directly against low cost sellers such as Dell Inc.
In wooing Apple, Santa Clara based Intel can claim the prestige of supplying one of Silicon Valley's most finicky customers, but the financial benefits will be relatively small.
Intel is the world's largest chip maker and Apple is one of the smallest major PC makers, with just under 4 percent of the market.
For its part, Armonk, N.Y. based IBM has already focused its energies on building chips for the fast growing video game industry.
Its chip technology will power next generation game consoles from all three of the major game companies Microsoft, Sony Corp. and Nintendo Co. On a generally flat day on the financial markets, Apple shares fell 32 cents to $37.92, Intel dropped 16 cents to $27.17 and IBM lost 79 cents to $75.
Jobs described the switch to Intel as the third major transition for Mac computers since the company was formed in 1976.
The other two were the initial switch to PowerPC chips between 1994 and 1996 and the move to a new operating system, OS X, between 2001 and 2003.
The change was fueled by a desire "to make the best computers going forward," Jobs said, noting that he promised high performance desktop and laptop models two years ago that never materialized.
"We envision amazing products we want to build for you.
But we don't know how to do it on the future of PowerPC."
He did not cite IBM by name, but Apple reportedly had been frustrated by IBM's inability to develop a chip that could process immense amounts of data without overheating.
Intel, by contrast, touts its cool running chips that consume less power.
But just because the chips are the same, differences will still exist between Macs and other PCs.
Most noticeably, Apple will continue to promote the virtues of its operating system, which is widely viewed as more stable and secure than Windows even if it runs a fraction of the programs.
"This is not a clone play," said Jupiter Research consultant Michael Gartenberg.
"OS X won't run on a Dell or HP machine.
Will someone come up with a hack to do so?
Absolutely.
But the OS X installer will not allow it to work on a non Apple machine that's not from Cupertino.
But I can imagine Microsoft creating an app where you push a button and get OS X, and push a button and get Windows."
A stormy, decade long relationship between Apple Computer Inc. and IBM is over, according to published reports.
Apple CEO Steve Jobs is expected to announce Monday morning at the company's software developers conference in San Francisco that Apple will discontinue using microprocessor chips made by IBM in favor of Intel chips, according to CNET Networks Inc.'s News.com and The Wall Street Journal.
Officials from Apple, Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. could not be reached Sunday to confirm the report.
For years, rumors of Apple's wish to jump to Intel have been circulating.
But two weeks ago, analysts were skeptical when The Wall Street Journal reported that Intel and Apple were in negotiations.
One reason for the skepticism is that the move represents a significant risk for Cupertino, California based Apple.
Switching to Intel's x86 chips would force Apple's programmers to rewrite its software in order to adapt to the new processor.
"I don't know that Apple's market share can survive another architecture shift," Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood told News.com.
"Every time they do this, they lose more customers."
News.com reported that Apple would begin the transition to Intel with its lower end computers, such as the Mac Mini, in mid 2006 and higher end models a year later.
Apple's break with IBM stemmed from Jobs' wish that IBM make a larger variety of the PowerPC processors used in Macintosh systems.
IBM balked because of concerns over the profitability of a low volume business, News.com reported.
By wrestling away Apple's business from IBM, Intel tightens its stranglehold on the PC processor business.
The company holds more than an 80 percent share of the market.
Although IBM suffers a setback with the loss of Apple, the company could reap a financial windfall from deals with Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony Corp. to put microprocessors it is producing in next generation video game consoles.
A new microprocessor that IBM co developed with Sony and Toshiba Corp, code named Cell and planned for Sony's next PlayStation console, is being touted as capable of delivering 10 times the performance of today's PC processors.
Apple Computer, for years a niche operator, took another step toward the market mainstream Monday by abandoning IBM chips in favour of Intel ones to power its trendy Macintosh machines.
Chief executive Steve Jobs told 3800 software developers attending an annual Apple conference here that new Macs will come with Intel microprocessors "by this time next year".
Under the alliance with the world's biggest chip maker, all Apple Macs will be equipped to handle Intel rather than IBM processors by the end of 2007.
"Our goal is to provide our customers with the best personal computers in the world, and looking ahead Intel has the strongest processor roadmap by far," Jobs said.
"It's been 10 years since our transition to the (IBM) PowerPC, and we think Intel's technology will help us create the best personal computers for the next 10 years," he said.
The switch to Intel chips, which are already found on most computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system, could allow Apple to cut prices of its desirable but expensive systems.
The company has been trying hard to cash in on the runaway success of its iPod digital music player, recently launching a "Mac Mini" computer to lure customers away from Windows PCs.
However, analysts said that Apple's fanatically loyal fan base may yet look askance at the Intel tie up.
"The world associates Intel with Windows," said Elise Bauer of the Pacifica Group technology consultancy.
"Intel is coupled with Windows to the point where we call it a 'Wintel' box.
If Apple is now embracing Intel, then there's some rebranding for both companies, Intel and Apple, to do around that," she said.
Software developers will have to rewrite Apple programs to enable them to run on Intel powered Macs.
Apple could also lose sales in the coming months as customers wait for the switch to the more powerful Intel processors.
But Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster predicted that the long term gains from the new partnership will outweigh any "short term pain".
Using Intel will give Apple a consistent supply of chips, bring the price of Macs more in line with their competitors, and reach a potentially larger developer community, Munster said.
Intel expressed delight at Apple's switch.
"We are thrilled to have the world's most innovative personal computer company as a customer," said Intel chief executive Paul Otellini, who was introduced to the conference here by an exuberant Jobs.
"Apple helped found the PC industry and throughout the years has been known for fresh ideas and new approaches," Otellini said.
"We look forward to providing advanced chip technologies, and to collaborating on new initiatives, to help Apple continue to deliver innovative products for years to come."
IBM minimised the development.
It has sold its PC division to Chinese group Lenovo and, in the chip market, is concentrating its efforts on making powerful processors for games machines made by Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo.
In a statement, the company said it was "aggressively moving the power architecture beyond the PC".
Apple was said to be unhappy with IBM's slow pace of development of a G5 chip for its PowerBook and iBook laptop computers.
The chip is already used in Mac desktops but generates too much heat for the laptops.
At least one of the software developers at the San Francisco conference said that Jobs' reversal will make it easier for them to write programs for both the Apple and Windows systems.
"We won't have to release two copies of applications for different platforms," said Jiva DeVoe, whose Arizona software firm makes project management applications.
Apple Computer is expected to announce Monday that it will begin using Intel chips in its Macintosh machines next year, ending a 14 year alliance with IBM and its processors, according to US media reports.
The move is a major change in strategy for Apple, according to The Wall Street Journal's online edition.
The New York Times called it "an unprecedented gamble."
"This is a seismic shift in the world of personal computing and consumer electronics," Richard Doherty, president of a computer and consumer electronics industry consulting firm, told the Times.
"It is bound to rock the industry, but it will also be a phenomenal engineering challenge for Apple," he said.
Apple CEO and co founder Steve Jobs is set to announce the switch Monday at Apple's annual developer's conference in San Francisco, the reports said.
The change could cause disruptions for Macintosh users as software developers scramble to make Apple programs run on Intel chips.
But it is a high profile win for Intel, the world's largest chip maker, which is trying to adjust after the erosion of its long term partnership with Microsoft, the papers said.
"For IBM, the end of the Apple partnership means the loss of a prestigious customer, but not one that is any longer very important to IBM's sales or profits," according to The New York Times.
IBM has long since expanded beyond the personal computer market.
It makes chips for Sony and Nintendo's video game machines as well as specialized processors for Internet routers and for cell phone technology.
Microsoft dealt Intel a blow last year when it said it would use an IBM processor in its next generation video game console, the Xbox 360, due to hit stores later this year.
"It is likely that Intel forged the alliance with Apple in an effort to counter the powerful home entertainment and game systems coming from Microsoft and Sony," the Times said.
Apple for its part had tried to counter the Microsoft Intel partnership when it forged the alliance in 1991 with IBM and Motorola.
Today, IBM supplies about half of the microprocessors used by Apple, and Freescale Semiconductor, a spinoff of Motorola, supplies the rest.
But in recent times Apple has been alarmed by IBM's failure to update its Power PC chip, the Times said, citing analysts.
In a risky move that could further shrink its minuscule slice of the PC market, Apple Computer Inc. announced plans Monday to switch its Macintosh computers to the same Intel Corp. chips used in systems that run Microsoft Windows.
Apple, which for years suggested its users "Think Different," will join all other PC makers in using microprocessors built on the x86 architecture.
The technology took root when IBM launched its first PC in 1981 and eventually turned Apple into a niche player.
"Our goal is to provide our customers with the best personal computers in the world, and looking ahead Intel has the strongest processor roadmap by far," said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO.
"It's been ten years since our transition to the PowerPC, and we think Intel's technology will help us create the best personal computers for the next ten years."
Jobs said Apple will begin offering Macs with Intel processors by June 2006 and will switch its entire product line by the end of 2007.
While Apple Computer Inc.'s new embrace of Intel Corp. microprocessors leaves IBM in the cold, the news really isn't bad for Big Blue, which may have found the Apple account more trouble than it was worth.
For one thing, IBM Corp. derived relatively little revenue from making its "Power" brand of chips for Apple's Macintosh computers, which own about 2 percent of the global market.
IBM's future chip plans are focused elsewhere notably the next generation of video game consoles made by Microsoft Corp., Sony Corp. and Nintendo Co. IBM's chips also power several kinds of IBM server computers, which account for a huge chunk of the company's hardware revenue.
Both kinds of machines require such high levels of performance that it becomes an expensive and challenging proposition to adapt their chips for personal computers, especially mobile devices that present stricter energy and cooling requirements.
So while winning Apple's business gives Intel some bragging rights, ceasing to make chips for Macs will let IBM focus on markets it believes can be much bigger.
"It's never a happy time when you lose a customer, no matter how large they are, but Apple's impact on the PC market is marginal at best these days," said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund IT Research.
"It will have more of a PR impact than a financial impact."
Added SG Cowen Co. analyst Steve Weber: "This move will likely have indiscernible impact."
IBM shares were down 67 cents, 0.9 percent, at $75.12 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
IBM declined to comment on Apple's announcement Monday other than to release a statement reiterating its chip strategy.
"IBM is aggressively moving the Power architecture beyond the PC," the statement said.
While most computer companies long ago abandoned chip manufacturing to industry standard suppliers such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., IBM has stayed with it as part of a broader strategy to distinguish the company as an innovative, high end tech provider.
That desire to focus on top tier markets motivated the recent spinoff of IBM's PC business to China's Lenovo Group Ltd. With IBM's internal chip needs falling short of the company's manufacturing capacity and demand from outside companies such as Apple only tepid IBM's microelectronics division lost $252 million (now euro205 million) in 2003, the last year in which IBM released detailed figures.
The segment grew at a paltry 0.6 percent in 2004, while IBM's overall sales jumped 8.3 percent to $96 billion (euro78.2 billion).
But IBM's long term microprocessing bet lies in a new breed of chips, code named Cell, being developed with Sony and Toshiba Corp.
Promising blazing speeds and the ability to carry out 10 sets of computing instructions at once, Cell is due to come out next year.
Hopes for Cell are so high that Sony, which plans to use Cell chips in the next generation of PlayStation game consoles, has invested $325 million (euro264.8 million) in improvements to IBM's semiconductor plant in East Fishkill, New York.
IBM's production of chips for Apple accounted for only about 2 percent of Fishkill's capacity.
Apple Computer Inc. Monday dumped IBM Corp. as the supplier of processor chips for its Macintosh computers.
Starting next year, future Macs will use Intel Corp. processors, the same kinds of chips found in millions of PCs running software from Apple's archrival Microsoft Corp.
Apple plans to have its first Intel based computers available a year from now, and its entire line of desktop and notebook computers are to feature Intel chips by 2007.
The company did not say which Intel chips would be used in its products, but Intel spokesman Charles Mulloy said they would be standard Intel processors, just like the Pentium 4 processors found in PCs running Microsoft's Windows operating system.
The deal, revealed at Apple's annual San Francisco conference for software developers, had been widely rumored in recent weeks.
The original Mac, released in 1984, used a processor made by Motorola Inc. A decade ago, Apple switched to PowerPC, a chip designed by Motorola and IBM.
By PC industry standards, the deal is small potatoes.
Apple sold 3.8 million Mac computers over the past four quarters, giving it less than 3 percent of the worldwide desktop computer market.
But Roger Kay, vice president for client computing at IDC Corp. in Framingham, said Intel will derive big benefits thanks to Apple's reputation.
"It's not just 2 percent of the market share, it's also a very prestigious company," Kay said.
Apple's iPod music players and iTunes Internet music retail store have made the company one of America's most respected electronics firms, and Kay said that some of that cachet could rub off on Intel.
IBM has endured major technical difficulties in producing sufficient quantities of the PowerPC G5, the chip used in today's Macs, and Apple has publicly criticized IBM for problems which forced Apple to delay the release of faster Macs.
IBM also failed to deliver a low power version of the G5 suitable for use in laptop computers.
Stephen Baker, director of industry analysis at the NPD Group in Port Washington, N.Y., said Apple's inability to put its most powerful chip in a laptop was a major problem, at a time when laptop sales are on the upswing.
"I think Apple looked out and said, what are we going to do here?
We're really losing ground," Baker said.
Intel makes the Pentium M, a cool running chip designed especially for laptops.
Baker predicted the first Apple machines with Intel processors would probably be laptops, and perhaps the low end Mac Mini home machine.
Apple has not said how long it will continue to provide technical support for owners of Macs based on IBM chips, but the company may have to give strong pledges of support, or sharp discounts, to sell its remaining stock of IBM based machines.
The NPD Group's Baker warned that as the release date of the new Intel Macs draws near, many people will delay their purchases until the new machines go on sale.
"It's when you get into that last three months or so and everybody knows it's coming," Baker said.
"That's when it's going to be very difficult for them to get people into the stores."

Apple announced on Monday plans to deliver models of its Macintosh computers using Intel microprocessors in 2006 and to convert all of its Macs to use Intel microprocessors by the end of 2007.
Apple previewed a version of its operating system, Mac OS X Tiger, running on an Intel based Mac to the over 3800 developers attending its Worldwide Developer Conference in San Francisco.
Apple's computers are now installed with PowerPC microprocessors from IBM, which are different in design from the popular X 86 chips of Intel and AMD.
"It's been 10 years since our transition to the PowerPC, and we think Intel's technology will help us create the best personal computers for the next 10 years," said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO.
Apple announced the availability of a Developer Transition Kit, consisting of an Intel based Mac development system along with preview versions of Apple's software, which will allow developers to prepare versions of their applications which will run on both PowerPC and Intel based Macs.
Paul Otellini, president and CEO of Intel, hailed Apple's decision to adopt Intel chips, saying his company is "thrilled to have the world's most innovative personal computer company as a customer."
Steven P. Jobs is preparing to take an unprecedented gamble by abandoning Apple Computer's 14 year commitment to chips developed by IBM and Motorola in favor of Intel processors for his Macintosh computers, industry executives informed of the decision said Sunday.
The move is a chesslike gambit in a broader industry turf war that pits the traditional personal computer industry against an emerging world of consumer electronics focused on the digital home.
"This is a seismic shift in the world of personal computing and consumer electronics," said Richard Doherty, president of the Envisioneering Group, a Seaford, N.Y., computer and consumer electronics industry consulting firm.
"It is bound to rock the industry, but it will also be a phenomenal engineering challenge for Apple."
Jobs is expected to announce the transition to Intel chips at Apple's annual developer conference, which will begin here Monday.
Apple's intention to shift to Intel chips beginning in 2006 was reported Friday by CNET News.com, a technology news service.
The Wall Street Journal had previously reported that Apple and IBM were negotiating.
Apple, according to analysts, has become increasingly alarmed by IBM's failure to deliver a new version of its Power PC chip, called the G5, that does not generate much heat a crucial feature for notebook computers, which do not have as much room for fans and ventilation as desktop machines.
Apple's notebooks now use the older G4 chips, made by Freescale Semiconductor, which was spun off from Motorola last year.
"That's a huge looming problem for Apple, if it can't keep up with Intel notebooks in performance," said Charles Wolf, an analyst for Needham & Co. "And that's been an IBM problem.
IBM hasn't delivered a cool running G5."
Jobs is scheduled to take the stage Monday to face his software developers, an important constituency he must convince of the wisdom of the shift.
It is the software developers who will need to do the hard work of making their programs run on Intel chips if Jobs' strategy is to succeed.
Apple must be able to persuade software developers who make business and graphics programs for the Macintosh Microsoft, Adobe, Quark and others to overhaul their code.
"That's a huge challenge for Apple, to win the software developers over and drag them along," said Wolf, the Needham analyst.
Apple Computer Inc. began a historic transition Monday: The Cupertino, Calif., firm plans to switch to Intel Corp. microprocessors for its Macintosh lineup starting next year.
Ending weeks of speculation, Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs confirmed plans to dump its current lineup of PowerPC chips, which Apple has long touted as superior to Intel chips.
Jobs said the two firms that have supplied Apple with microprocessors for years, IBM and the Motorola spin off Freescale, can no longer supply the kinds of chips that Apple needs for future products.
Jobs warmly embraced Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini onstage before hundreds of attendees at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, in a gesture that symbolized the new partnership between the two iconic Silicon Valley companies.
"We're so happy the world's most innovative computer company and the world's most innovative chip company have finally teamed up," Otellini told the crowd at San Francisco's Moscone Center West.
"I think this brings together the skills and the engineering excellence of two great companies."
Apple plans to make the transition over a 21/2 year period.
Some Macs with Intel inside are scheduled to be released in June 2006, with most of the lineup to be converted by June 2007.
Jobs said he hopes the full switch will be completed by the end of 2007.
Although there has been much speculation through the years about such a partnership, few realized how long the two firms have been working on this.
In his speech, Jobs revealed that a team of Apple engineers has been secretly working on a transition from IBM's PowerPC platform to an Intel based architecture for five years inside a building on the firm's Cupertino campus.
In fact, every edition of Macintosh OS X that has been released since then has been been designed to also run on the Intel platform "just in case," Jobs said.
"The Mac OS has been leading a secret double life for the past five years," Jobs said.
"So Mac OS X is cross platform by design right from the very beginning."
A few developers in the audience groaned when Jobs confirmed the switch, but later cheered when Jobs demonstrated a Macintosh desktop that was already operating on an Intel Pentium 4 3.6 GHz processor.
Jobs said Apple decided to start the transition now because Intel's microprocessor development road map promises features, like more efficient power consumption, that Apple did not foresee in similar plans for the PowerPC chip.
Apple had great products planned, but "we don't know how to build them with the current PowerPC program," Jobs said.
Apple's move marks a significant but risky combination between two of Silicon Valley's largest, most visible players.
"Every time they've tried to make this kind of transition, they've managed to lose market share," said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at market research firm Insight 64.
"And they don't have that much market share to lose."
Shaw Wu, an analyst with American Technology Research of San Francisco, said the Apple Intel alliance also presents a marketing problem, because Apple has spent more than 10 years touting the superiority of its PowerPC chips over Intel's Pentium.
Apple "could risk alienating some of its loyal customer base," Wu said in a report.
"It's a gamble," said Kevin Krewell, an analyst at In Stat/MDR, noting that a transition to a new chip is never easy.
"But if anyone can make this transition, it's Apple.
They've done more transitions than anyone else."
The news Monday didn't make waves on Wall Street.
Apple closed at $37.92, down 32 cents per share in Nasdaq trading.
Intel shares were down 62 cents, closing at $19.79.
The agreement has major symbolic value, bridging the gap between two firms that have been on ideologically opposite sides of the tech world for 25 years.
Apple has been using Motorola chips since the early 1980s, when the firm essentially inaugurated the personal computing era.
In 1991, Motorola and IBM began collaborating on the PowerPC, which then became the central brain for Apple's Macintosh computers.
Although Apple had an early lead in the field, it was soon overtaken by a powerful partnership that relegated Apple to a niche technology player.
Ironically, that partnership was keyed by Intel, which paired with Microsoft Corp. to create the "Wintel" platform, which dominates desktop computing today.
Apple's switch comes as IBM, which made G5 processors used in Macintosh desktops, has also begun to focus on new partners.
A statement IBM released after Jobs' keynote speech did not react directly to Apple's impending chip switch.
Instead, IBM highlighted its own recent inroads in the video game industry.
"IBM is aggressively moving the Power Architecture beyond the PC, as shown by our recent successes with the next generation gaming systems announced by Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo," the statement said.
"IBM is focused on the highest value opportunities in each marketplace, and our direction with the Power Architecture is consistent with that strategy."
Meanwhile, Freescale Semiconductor Inc., the Austin, Texas, company that spun off from Motorola in 2004 and makes the G4 chips used in Apple laptops, also tried to downplay the loss of Apple.
"Apple represents only 3 percent of total Freescale revenues," said a memo from Freescale Chairman and CEO Michel Mayer to employees, which the company released publicly.
"It was becoming more and more difficult to justify that level of investment to provide the customized products Apple required to satisfy a small part of the market."
In the past year or so, some frustration in Cupertino with IBM was apparent.
About a year ago, Apple publicly blamed IBM for its short supply of PowerPC chips for the Power Mac G5 desktop computers.
Apple later said it had to delay the release of its new iMac computers because IBM couldn't meet Apple's demand for similar chips.
Another challenge Apple has been facing with IBM is delivering processors that consume less power and create less heat.
One of the biggest questions for Apple has been whether the computer maker will be able to upgrade its lineup of laptop computers from PowerPC G4 chips to PowerPC G5 chips, which Apple Executive Vice President Tim Cook has called "the mother of all thermal challenges."
On Monday, Jobs said a key factor in the switch was Intel's plans for chips with a performance to power ratio more than four times greater than any PowerPC chip in the works.
The move to an Intel platform could provide quite a few headaches for software developers, who now have to retool their products, although Jobs said Apple engineers already have codes to ease the transition.
Apple announced the availability of a $999 Developer Transition Kit, consisting of an Intel based Mac development system along with preview versions of Apple's own software for the Intel chips.
Leaping six months ahead of schedule, Apple Computer on Tuesday showed off two new computers powered by Intel microprocessors, giving the company new leverage in winning over PC customers.
In a 90 minute address at the Macworld trade show here, Apple Chairman Steve Jobs unveiled a new iMac desktop computer powered by an Intel dual core processor that he said runs more than twice as fast as current models but costs the same.
The news was received with typical enthusiasm by hundreds of Mac devotees on opening day of the four day show.
The new iMac went on sale Tuesday at $1300 and $1700, depending on screen size and other features.
Jobs also showed off a new line of Intel powered laptop computers called MacBook Pro, which he said are four to five times faster than the PowerBook models they replace.
Priced at $2000 and $2500, the MacBooks will begin shipping in February.
The announcements impressed both analysts and investors, who bid Apple stock up $4.81 a share to $80.66 on the Nasdaq.
Intel shares fell 35 cents to close at $26.12.
It also surprised some Apple watchers who had anticipated new additions to the company's wildly successful line of iPods.
By shifting to Intel from its longtime use of PowerPC chips built by Motorola and IBM, Apple gets a significant boost in performance and, even more importantly, experts say, a comfort level with current users of Windows PCs.
"Now, when you buy a Mac, it will say "'Intel Inside.'
That will be a comforting factor," said Jim Dalrymple, news director for Macworld magazine.
"The move to Intel is critical to Apple's future because it allows (the company) to attract the hard core PC crowd," added analyst Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies.
"If they show they can run applications two or three or four times faster, they will get a lot of attention."
The Intel introductions come on the heels of a dazzling 2005 when 32 million iPods sold, 14 million of them in the fourth quarter alone.
In 2004, the company sold just 8.3 million of the devices.
Apple's sales from October through December hit a record $5.7 billion, compared with $3.49 billion in the same quarter a year earlier.
By focusing on its new Intel based products, Apple is appealing to its power users and laying groundwork for expanding its share beyond the estimated 4 percent of the personal computer market that it now holds.
Experts called the accelerated Intel introduction a big advantage for Apple, which had previously predicted that Intel powered Macs wouldn't be available until midyear.
Getting to market early gives power hungry Mac users a reason to buy a new machine and software makers new incentives to develop programs that run on the new platform.
"This is an amazing effort, given the short amount of time they had to work on it," said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst with Jupiter Research.
While only one Intel powered Mac is available right now, Jobs said the entire line of Macs will shift to Intel by the end of 2006.
Software developers also are racing to write programs that will run on both the Intel and older PowerPC.
The Intel announcement was accompanied by an appearance by Intel Chairman Paul Otellini, who walked on stage wearing a white "bunny suit" used in chip manufacturing.
"Steve, I want to report that Intel is ready to go," he said.
For years Apple shunned Intel products and even mocked them in its television ads.
But last June it announced it would use Intel chips, partly motivated by an inability to get its G5 microprocessors to run effectively in its PowerBook laptop computers.
Intel's dual core chips are a much better fit for the laptop platform, analysts say.
Preceding Tuesday's unveiling, Apple also showed off improvements to its suite of iLife software, which includes photo, video and music editing capabilities.
New to the $79 lineup is software that lets users more easily produce podcasts and create their own Web sites.
"This takes emerging consumer activities, such as blogging and podcasting, and makes them drop dead simple and attractive," said Van Baker, an analyst with Gartner.
He called the new Apple products "a home run."
While Apple surprised observers with its quick conversion to the Intel platform, it also defied speculation that it would introduce a new iPod and perhaps unveil a new Macintosh designed to be a command center for other consumer electronics in the home, such as stereos and televisions.
But analyst Bajarin said Apple is likely to introduce new iPods later this year, and media center Macs might not be on the near horizon, even though companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Hewlett Packard Co. are pushing hard to market such products.
"I don't think we'll see that from Apple in the short term," he said.
"Apple has a tendency to let other companies get the arrows in their backs, then Apple comes in and does it better."
Apple Computer Inc.'s historic shift to Intel Corp. microprocessors came earlier than expected Tuesday as CEO Steve Jobs unveiled an updated iMac computer based on the world's largest semiconductor company's new two brained chip.
The switch to Intel was first announced in June, when Apple said it expected to begin making the transition by the middle of 2006.
But on Tuesday, Apple CEO Steve Jobs was joined onstage by Intel CEO Paul Otellini, who was wearing a bunny suit, to make the announcement.
"With (the) Mac OS X (operating system) plus Intel's latest dual core processor under the hood, the new iMac delivers performance that will knock our customers' socks off," said Jobs.
For years, Apple shunned Intel, which has provided chips that power a majority of the world's PCs, along with Windows software from Microsoft Corp.
In the late 1990s, Apple even ran TV ads with a Pentium II glued to a snail.
But Apple, looking for faster, more energy efficient chips, became increasingly frustrated in recent years as its chip suppliers, IBM Corp. and Motorola Corp.'s spinoff, Freescale Semiconductor Inc., failed to meet its needs.
Of particular concern was IBM's apparent inability to develop a G5 chip that would work well in notebook computers.
Intel, on the other hand, has been focusing on developing chips specifically tailored for notebooks.
In 2003, it launched its Centrino notebook technology with a processor that boosted a longer battery life by minimizing its power demand without a major hit to performance.
During last week's International Consumer Electronics Show, Intel unveiled the latest generation, the Core Duo, which features two computing engines on a single piece of silicon.
It was that chip the Apple decided to fit into the new iMac.
The Core Duo chip's low energy requirements are expected to enable ever smaller computers, including some built right into television sets as the industry gears its machines more toward multimedia use.
Apple Computer Inc.'s new Intel based computers took center stage at CEO Steve Jobs' speech at the Macworld Expo on Tuesday but he also unveiled changes to the company's software and iPod accessory lineup: The iMac with Intel's Core Duo processor: The machines are up to two times faster than older iMacs running the G5 chip.
They've got a built in camera for Web conferencing and a remote control to access music, videos and photos from across a room.
Priced at $1299 with a 17 inch (43 centimeter) display and a 1.83 gigahertz processor and $1699 with a 20 inch (50 centimeter) monitor and 2.0 GHz processor.
Shipping now.
The MacBook Pro, also based on Intel's Core Duo processor: A departure from the PowerBook moniker, the notebooks run up to four times faster than Apple's previous hardware.
An inch (2.5 centimeters) thin and 5.6 pounds (2.5 kilograms), they include a built in camera for Web conferencing and a remote control.
A 1.67 GHz laptop with a 15.4 inch (39 centimeter) display is priced at $1999.
A 1.83 GHz model, also with a 15.4 inch monitor, will sell for $2499.
Shipping in February.
The iPod Radio Remote: A device that plugs into the iPod Nano and newer iPods with video capabilities, allowing them to play FM radio.
Users control the device with a wired remote.
Available immediately for $49.
Optional iPod integration in cars made by Chrysler: Available in most of Chrysler's Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge model cars, the feature makes it easier for drivers to listen to iPods with the vehicle's stereo system.
iLife '06: The latest version of Apple's suite of software for manipulating video, pictures and music on the Mac includes new features in iPhoto for sharing pictures over the Internet, additional production capabilities in iMovie and the ability to deliver webcasts using the GarageBand application for producing songs and other audio recordings.
Available immediately for $79.
Included for free on all new Macs.
iWork '06: The latest version of Apple's software for creating documents and presentations.
Apple says the upgrade is easier to use.
Available immediately for $79.
Apple Computer Inc. on Tuesday unveiled its first Mac computers based on Intel processors, marking a big shift of the computer maker.
Addressing a packed crowd of the Apple faithful in the annual Macworld show in San Francisco, chief executive Steve Jobs released the long awaited new products: the desktop and laptop machines using Intel's dual core chips.
The iMac will come in the same sizes and sell for the same prices as the current models, but the Intel chips make it two to three times faster, Jobs said.
A 1.83 gigahertz version of the iMac with a 17 inch screen sells for 1299 U.S. dollars.
A new laptop computer, called the MacBook Pro, will be available in February.
The machine, four to five times faster than current PowerBook laptops, will also include a built in camera for video conference, he said.
"The MacBook Pro is the fastest Mac notebook ever, obviously," Jobs said.
Apple had used the PowerPC processors made by IBM and Motorola in its Macintosh computers for more than two decades.
But the company planned a shift to Intel last year, after the PowerPC processor was criticized as being slower.
With the first personal computer Apple II, Apple had pioneered the information technology during the 1980s.
Now Apple computers' market share is shrinking under competition from cheap producers such as Dell, but the company still has a group of loyal fans.
Apple Computer Inc. Tuesday introduced the first computer in its Macintosh line to use a chip made by Intel Corp.
The move accelerates a shift by the maker of machines renowned for their elegant design and ease of use to the same brand of processor that runs the Windows software of Apple's archrival, Microsoft Corp.
At the annual Macworld trade show in San Francisco, Apple chief executive Steve Jobs introduced the first Intel based Mac, a new model of the company's popular iMac line.
"With ,Intel's latest dual core processor under the hood, the new iMac delivers performance that will knock our customers' socks off," said Jobs.
The new machine also marks a new era for chip supplier Intel.
The iMac is the first computer to use a new line of Intel chips called Core Duo.
A successor to the Pentium M chip Intel designed for use in laptop computers, the Core Duo is actually two processors in one.
Each chip has two processing cores that enable it to handle many simultaneous tasks faster and more reliably than standard single core chips.
Apple has long relied on PowerPC chips made by IBM Corp, but IBM didn't introduce new and improved chip designs as quickly as Intel which, like its rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc., has been making dual core Pentium chips since last year.
And the PowerPC chips for Apple's line of iBook and PowerBook laptop computers lagged behind Intel's and AMD's laptop chips.
Cost was also a problem, according to industry analyst Roger Kay, the president of Endpoint Technologies Associates Inc. in Wayland.
Because Intel produces a huge volume of processor chips for companies around the world, it can offer chips at lower prices than IBM.
"The benefit that the user gets is the lower cost that comes from the volume production that Intel can bring," Kay said.
Apple disclosed last year that it would switch over its entire product line to Intel processors.
The company has modified its Mac OS X operating system to run on the Intel chips, which are exactly the same as those used by Windows based PCs.
However, the Intel based Macs won't be able to run Windows software.
The transition to Intel wasn't supposed to begin until the spring, but Jobs said that the Intel based iMac, priced at $1299, is available now at Apple retailers.
He also revealed a new Intel based laptop Mac, priced at $1999, set to go on sale next month.
At Tuesday's event, Jobs also unveiled upgrades to Apple's iLife lifestyle software and iWork productivity software, and the Radio Remote, a headphone that transforms the company's iPod music player into an FM radio.
The iPod's explosive success was reflected in Apple's financial results.
Jobs said Apple sold 14 million iPods in its first quarter of fiscal 2006, which ended in December.
This helped to generate quarterly revenues of $5.7 billion, a billion dollars more than Apple had predicted last October.
Apple's results were also boosted by stronger sales of Mac computers.
Apple sold 1.25 million of the machines in the first quarter.
The popularity of the iPod has made Apple a major force in consumer electronics.
The company's iTunes Music Store is the leading distributor of recorded music on the Internet, and has begun selling downloadable TV programs for viewing on its video iPod.
Some industry analysts had expected the company to unveil new products for the home entertainment market Tuesday.
Rival Microsoft launched a major push of its own at last week's International Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas.
Microsoft showed off a new operating system and an array of products for managing music and movies.
Jim Pelham, an analyst at Strategy Analytics Inc., a Boston communications and entertainment technology consultany, said he has long expected Apple to introduce other products to build on the iPod's success.
But he understands why the company isn't venturing too far off the beaten path.
"I don't think they're really in the position that Microsoft is, to spread their bets across several niches," said Pelham.
Despite its success in music, Apple remains a niche computer company with a loyal but relatively small following, Pelham said.
Apple's stock surged $4.81 to close at $80.86, while Intel's stock declined 35 cents to $26.12, both on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

Nearly a quarter century ago, Apple Computer ran a snarky ad after its onetime rival encroached on its territory: "Welcome, IBM.
Seriously."
This week, however, Steven P. Jobs had a different message for Big Blue, which had since become a chief ally "Goodbye.
Seriously."
Jobs, 50, a co founder of Apple, is famously brash and mercurial.
Even so, the Apple faithful not to mention IBM itself were caught by surprise by Apple's decision to end its 14 year relationship with IBM and team with Intel for its computer chip needs.
The buzz that began Monday among developers, bloggers, analysts and Apple followers trying to guess Jobs' true designs has not let up.
After all, Jobs is a legend in no small part because he defied the monster combination that is Wintel as the digerati call the Windows and Intel alliance and lived to talk about it.
Apple's decision in the 1980s to use a different chip than the one used by most personal computers "fit in with the idea of Think Different," Stephen G. Wozniak, who founded Apple with Jobs in 1976, said in an e mail exchange.
"So it's hard for some people to accept this switch."
So what could a Macintel possibly hope to accomplish?
Potentially, quite a lot.
In striking the deal, Jobs, Apple's chief executive, has opened a range of tantalizing new options for his quirky company.
Many people in the industry believe that Jobs is racing quietly toward a direct challenge to Microsoft and Sony in the market for digital entertainment gear for the living room.
Indeed, Sony's top executives had tried to persuade Jobs to adopt a chip that IBM has been developing for the next generation Sony PlayStation.
On paper, an Intel processor inside a Macintosh would put the vast library of Windows based games and software programs within the reach of Mac users at least those who are willing to run a second operating system on their computers.
Moreover, having Intel Inside might solve an important perception problem that has long plagued Apple in its effort to convert consumers who are attracted to the company's industrial design, but who have stayed away because the computers do not run Windows programs.
There is an immediate risk in the tie up with Intel, however: Jobs could soon find himself trapped if his best customers stop buying IBM based Macintoshes while they wait for more powerful Intel based systems, which are likely to begin arriving in January 2006.
"There is going to be a long wait," said Mark D. Stahlman, a Wall Street analyst at Caris & Co.
The power conserving 64 bit Intel chips that Apple is counting on to rejuvenate its laptop products will not be available until early 2007, he pointed out.
In an interview, Jobs rejected the notion that Apple might suffer from what is known as the "Osborne Effect," a term that describes the fate of the computer pioneer Adam Osborne whose firm went bankrupt when he announced a successor to his pioneering portable computer before it was available.
At Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, Jobs talked of a transition that would appear almost seamless to customers.
"As we look ahead we can envision some amazing products we want to build for you, and we don't know how to build them with the future Power PC roadmap," he said.
Nothing was seamless about how the deal with Intel came together.
Several executives close to the last minute dealings between Apple and IBM said that Jobs waited until the last moment 3 p.m. on Friday, June 4 to inform Big Blue.
Those executives said that IBM had learned about Apple's negotiations with Intel from media reports and that Apple had not returned phone calls in recent weeks.
The two camps dispute what led to the breakup.
People close to IBM said pricing was a central issue, while Jobs insisted on stage Monday that IBM had failed to meet promised performance measures.
On stage, Jobs noted that he had promised both a 3 gigahertz Macintosh as well as a G5 Power PC, promises that he had not been able to deliver.
In the end, Jobs was given no choice but to move his business to Intel when IBM executives said that without additional Apple investment they were unwilling to pursue the faster and lower power chips he badly needs for his laptop business.
"Technical issues were secondary to the business issues," said an executive close to the IBM side of the negotiations.
Because the business was not profitable, IBM "decided not to continue to go ahead with the product road map."
But Jobs disputed this assessment, simply stating that IBM had failed to meet its technology roadmap.
The issues in the end, he said, came down to speed and the absence of a chip that consumed less electricity than traditional processors designed for PCs.
"As soon as I heard Steve say that the factor where Intel's roadmap was superior was processing power per ((watt)) I knew right away that it was exactly what I have been reading and saying and so have many others, that this is the real key to the future of high performance computers," Wozniak wrote.
As it happens, Intel's was not the only alternative chip design that Apple had explored for the Mac.
An executive close to Sony said that last year Jobs had meetings in California with both Nobuyuki Idei, then the chairman and chief executive of the Japanese consumer electronics firm, and with Kenichi Kutaragi, the creator of the Sony PlayStation.
Kutaragi tried to interest Jobs in adopting the Cell microprocessor, which is being developed by IBM for use in the coming PlayStation 3, in exchange for access to certain Sony technologies.
Jobs rejected the idea, telling Kutaragi that he was disappointed with the Cell design, which he believed would be even less effective than the Power PC.
Now that Jobs has broken with IBM, Apple is free to pursue a potentially intriguing consumer electronics strategy with Intel.Intel has been looking for ways to get its chips into devices that can compete with game consoles as living room entertainment hubs.
Indeed, all three next generation video game machines made by Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony are based on IBM chips.
And analysts think that both Microsoft's Xbox 360 and the Sony PlayStation 3, scheduled to arrive next spring, will be positioned as home digital media hubs in addition to being video game machines and priced far lower than the Intel powered, Windows based Media Center PCs that are also aimed at the living room.
Should the new consoles find wide acceptance as broad based entertainment engines, Intel will need to respond and one attractive alternative would be an inexpensive Macintosh Mini based on an Intel processor, capable of running the vast library of PC games.
Before he can set his sights on that new market, Jobs faces the task of shoring up his base, his customers and developers.
On Monday, he made the case to the software designers who must be willing to rewrite their software for the new Macintel world.
Early indications are that he made a convincing presentation.
"The reason people buy Mac is the software, and I think the real fun is yet to come," said Scott Love, the president of AquaMinds, a software concern in Palo Alto, Calif., that sells a Macintosh program called NoteTaker used by writers, researchers and students.
"We'll be able to develop a program that will just work on both IBM and Intel based computers."
On the hardware side, Jobs' secret weapon will be his ability to run Apple's manufacturing business efficiently while the company waits for its next hit product, whether it is an Intel based Mini, or some new category of consumer product for the Christmas season.
"One area where Steve is really good and manically focused is on supply chain issues," said Dan'l Lewin, who worked for Jobs at both Apple and Next, and who is now Microsoft's top executive in Silicon Valley.
Even more important will be his ability to persuade the Macintosh faithful to join him in his journey from IBM to Intel.
That is where Jobs has an advantage over virtually every other business executive.
"He is still committed to the idea of an Apple culture," said Peter Schwartz, the co founder and chairman of the Global Business Network, a consulting firm in Emeryville, Calif. "It is the counterculture to the dominant Windows culture."
In the late 1990s, Apple Computer Inc. ran TV ads mocking the Intel Corp. chips in rival Windows based PCs: The Pentium II glued to a snail and the toasted bunny suit were supposed to suggest that Apple's Macintosh computers were simply faster.
How times have changed.
Apple CEO Steve Jobs warmly embraced Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini this week as they announced that Macs will switch to chips built by the same company that has made a fortune selling the hardware that powers PCs running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system.
Though the transition is likely to be rocky at first for Apple, programmers and customers, the move could lead to Macs that are both more competitive and more compatible with Windows.
It could even open the Mac to software titles now available only to Windows users.
At the same time, Apple would retain as much control as it wants over its software and brand.
Beyond the future performance and energy efficiency improvements Intel has promised, Apple could deploy an Intel security scheme that could allow Apple to keep its operating system locked to Macs.
Apple also could tap a separate Intel technology that lets multiple operating systems run efficiently on a single chip.
Such advances could be critical for Apple, which has gained a reputation for building innovative and stylish machines that run Apple's own, acclaimed Mac OS X operating system.
By not allowing clones, as are common in the Windows world, Apple can still charge a premium and differentiate itself.
After all, the microprocessor may be the brain of a computer, but the soul is provided by the software, which Apple has said will continue to be locked to its systems.
Apple's business model of selling its own computers and operating system stems from 1970s, when Jobs and friend Steve Wozniak were pioneering the personal computer industry from a Silicon Valley garage.
At the time, a fledgling company then called Micro Soft was just getting started.
That changed in the early 1980s, when International Business Machines Corp. rushed to put out a personal computer that could compete against Apple.
Big Blue integrated hardware and software from other companies namely, Intel and Microsoft into its systems.
IBM famously failed to stop competitors from copying its PC.
A healthy IBM clone industry grew, fueled by the support of software developers, who saw the huge business opportunity in the volume of clone PCs being purchased.
Apple continued to sell systems based on non Intel processors and its own software.
Even in 1984, when it launched the first Mac, it stuck with Motorola chips and its own software.
In the 1990s, Motorola and Apple joined forces with IBM, which by then long realized it had lost control of the PC, to build the more powerful PowerPC microprocessor to do battle with WinTel.
But Apple's market share continued to slide.
Corporations and consumers embraced Windows based systems because they could run more programs.
Software developers loved WinTel because it guaranteed a huge market.
Apple became the niche player it is today, with just 2.3 percent of the worldwide market, according to the latest figures from the research firm IDC.
Still, Jobs managed to continue marketing the Mac as the Porsche of the PC industry.
But IBM and Motorola, which last year spun off its chip business into Freescale Semiconductor Inc., haven't been able to give Apple what it needs.
Freescale's G4 has seen only incremental improvements in performance while IBM's G5 runs too hot for notebook computers.
And so Jobs went chip hunting.
Intel promises Apple fast, energy efficient chips, manufacturing reliability and possibly even lower prices.
Apple could lose control of its operating system when it starts using next year the same hardware that powers the Windows world.
That's where the new technologies come into play and why Apple is so willing to make a move.
Intel has been touting a hardware based security plan called LaGrande Technology as a way to keep systems secure by locking data with a key that's embedded in a hardware chip.
But LaGrande also could be used to ensure that certain software only runs on permitted machines, such as Mac OS X only running on systems built by Apple.
"You can tie the serial number of the software with the hardware ID, and say these things go together and shall never be separate," said Roger Kay, an analyst at IDC.
But there's a much bigger opportunity for Apple beyond faster, more efficient chips.
Though it will prevent Mac OS X from leaking non Apple PCs, it could allow Apple systems to run Windows and its universe of programs at full speed.
Currently, running Windows programs on Macs requires emulators that slow down performance.
"It seems to me that Jobs is putting himself in the sights of Bill Gates," said Don Yachtman, a Salt Lake City based software developer.
"Microsoft may act like they don't care about Apple's move to Intel but you never know until they launch an attack."
But Microsoft isn't likely to complain.
After all, Apple or its customers would still have to buy a copy of Windows.
Nonetheless, Apple faces technical and psychological hurdles in the near term.
"I'm sure some of Apple's loyal customer base see this as a sellout," said Tim Deal, senior analyst with Technology Business Research.
"These users supported this niche, boutique player for years and this agreement with Intel removes a very important difference between a Mac and a PC."
In just a few short years, Apple Computer Inc. and its iPod portable media players changed the way consumers get music and movies on the go.
Is Apple now planning to do the same with entertainment inside the home?
When company co founder and CEO Steve Jobs opens Apple's Macworld Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, industry analysts and others widely expect he'll announce new software and hardware designed to carry iPod's successes into the living room.
New ultra thin Apple laptops and possibly a new Mac Mini desktop could easily link up with TVs to record and pause live television programming, play video discs and music, and show off digital photos and home movies, many Apple watchers predict.
They'll likely run on Intel Corp. processors a first for Apple and could include Intel's new Viiv (rhymes with five) technology designed for home entertainment.
Industry analysts also predict the company might release updates to its entertainment related software, including its year old Front Row program for browsing music, video and pictures.
Notoriously secretive Apple has said nothing publicly about what Jobs might introduce Tuesday.
But a bigger push into home entertainment "has to be something they're looking at," said Steve Baker, vice president of technology research company NPD Group.
Why?
Because even though Apple virtually created the current market for portable media players, it has less than 5 percent of the overall market for PCs and is barely a contender in the nascent business of computers designed specifically for home entertainment.
Also, the convergence of portable and home entertainment is considered to be the future of the digital lifestyle.
Apple's main rivals Microsoft Corp. and the manufacturers of Windows based computers are pushing hard to dominate the digital living room with their "media center" PCs.
Last week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Microsoft said sales of PCs running its Windows XP Media Center operating system rose by 300 percent last year.
More than 6.5 million of the entertainment focused PCs have been sold since 2002, according to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.
Microsoft and its partners also showed off new media center software and hardware designed to improve the way consumers can move digital content around between their TVs, portable devices and home PCs.
"The media center PC numbers have been rising pretty steadily," said Roger Kay, president of research firm Endpoint Technologies Associates Inc. "Consumers have shown they want the digital home."
Despite Microsoft's head start, Apple has some major assets in its corner namely its best selling iPods, which now play videos, and its related iTunes online music and video store.
Beginning this week, it also will likely have a new heavyweight partner.
Apple is widely expected to introduce its first computers containing processors from Intel, which could dramatically widen the company's appeal beyond its niche of hard core devotees.
To mass market computer users, the Intel logo would be a comforting signal that Apple machines will be compatible with other equipment in their homes and in the tech world at large.
Apple last year struck a potentially revolutionary deal to replace chips from IBM Corp. and Austin, Texas based Freescale Semiconductor Inc. with Intel chips in its computers beginning this year.
In December, Apple and Intel also quietly helped launch a new tech industry consortium designed to create new standards to improve the flow of content between TVs, computers and other devices.
Kurt Scherf, principal analyst at Dallas based research outfit Parks Associates, said he thinks Apple plans to introduce a revamped version of its Mac Mini computer designed specifically as a home entertainment hub.
He also predicts Apple will announce new deals for content like its recent agreements with big TV networks such as NBC, ABC and Disney for programming for its iPods.
"They've definitely already set the precedent in content" and portable devices, Scherf said.
"Now they've got to try to seriously address the living room with some sort of media server of their own."
The Mac Mini, small enough to be held in one hand but packed with enough power to handle home entertainment, seems like the most likely candidate, Scherf said.
Baker, the NPD analyst, predicted that any Apple push into home entertainment would likely include all its computers, not just a single one like the Mac Mini.
And then, given Apple's propensity for surprise, others predict something completely different.
The Apple Core, an online Web site for Apple enthusiasts, speculated that the company may introduce new big screen plasma TVs with Mac computers built into them.
Such new Apple TVs, the site predicted Monday, could download movies, organize home pictures and videos, and play music, all with a single remote control.

Intel Corp., the largest chip maker, on Thursday increased its revenue forecast for the second quarter because of strong sales of notebook computers that use its Centrino chip.
The company said revenue would be in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.3 billion, higher than the range of $8.6 billion to $9.2 billion it gave in April.
The quarter ends July 2.
The revised estimates beat the estimates of Wall Street analysts, who were expecting sales of about $8.99 billion, according to Thomson Financial.
Intel does not provide earnings guidance, but analysts have forecast a profit of 28 cents a share for the second quarter.
The company posted earnings of 27 cents a share in the second quarter last year.
Before Intel released its update, shares in the company rose 60 cents on Thursday, to close at $27.70, then fell slightly in after hours trading.
Intel's revised forecast capped a week of good news for the semiconductor sector.
On Wednesday, the Semiconductor Industry Association estimated that worldwide chip sales would increase 6 percent in 2005, to $226 billion, revising its earlier forecast that pegged 2005 sales as flat with 2004, saying that high energy prices have not dampened electronics sales as the industry had feared.
And earlier in the week, Texas Instruments raised its financial targets to the high end of its projected range, citing strong demand, while National Semiconductor reported better than expected earnings.
On Monday Intel announced a deal with Apple Computer to provide the chips that power Macintosh computers, replacing IBM's PowerPC chips, a crucial vote of confidence for the chip maker as it moves to put a period of technical setbacks and missed deadlines behind it.
Tim Luke, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, called Intel's revised forecast encouraging, particularly given recent changes at the company, including a new chief executive, the move to dual core processing and a new manufacturing process known as 65 nanometer.
"They are executing well on a series of transitions," said Luke, whose company has a buy rating on Intel stock.
Intel expects gross margins to be approximately 57 percent, plus or minus a point, as compared with the earlier forecast of 56 percent, plus or minus a couple of points.
Intel also said it expected to benefit from a tax rate of 26 percent compared with its earlier estimate of a 31 percent rate.
Intel's gains from equity investments and other items are expected to be approximately $100 million.
After touting its Macintosh computers as superior alternatives for more than 20 years, Apple Computer Inc. said Monday that it plans to switch to the very Intel microprocessors that power machines designed to run Microsoft Windows.
The long rumored move is expected to help Apple compete better against Windows PCs in performance and potentially price, though analysts believe the headaches from the transition could further damage its slim 2.3 percent worldwide market share.
Apple, which will continue to tightly couple its computers and its software, now must convince users and potential buyers that today's Macs will not become the technology equivalent of lame ducks.
And it must get programmers to develop software that works on both versions.
In a speech to software developers Monday, Apple CEO Steve Jobs admitted the change will not be fast or easy.
The first Intel based Macs won't appear until 2006, and the full product line won't shift to Intel until the following year, he said.
"This is not going to be a transition that happens overnight," Jobs said.
"It's going to happen over a period of a few years."
He said the move was driven by the fact that its current chip suppliers IBM Corp. and Freescale Semiconductor Inc. could not promise the same horsepower and power efficiency as Intel, the world's largest semiconductor company.
Programmers can immediately start developing software in a format that will run natively on both existing and future Mac chips, he said.
Apple also will have a technology in place that will translate the code so that older programs will run on the Macs with Intel inside.
Jobs revealed that Apple has been working on the move for at least five years, creating two versions of its Mac OS X operating system for both the current Mac chips and those built by Intel.
"Mac OS X has been leading a secret double life," he said.
The news was greeted by a mix of cheers and laughs at the conference and uncertainty among Mac fans who believe a switch to Intel chips is like joining forces with the dark side.
Wall Street had mixed feelings, too.
Shares of Apple closed at $37.92, down 32 cents, in Monday trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Intel shares lost 16 cents to close at $27.17.
Calming fears that Apple's switch would ignite a revolt among its most important software programmers, Jobs was joined on stage by two major developers Adobe Systems Inc. and Microsoft.
Both announced that they would support Macs running the existing and new hardware.
Apple also quickly snuffed out the possibility that computer makers other than itself might someday offer Mac OS X.
But it did not say how it would prevent users from installing a pirated copy of the software on their computers from Dell Inc., Hewlett Packard Co. or others.
It's also not clear whether the move might make Macs more vulnerable to attacks by viruses and other malware.
To date, they've been mostly exempt.
In making the move, Apple is abandoning a processor known as the PowerPC that it developed with International Business Machines Corp. and Motorola Inc. in the 1990s to compete against Intel's x86 architecture and which it touted as more powerful.
On Monday, neither Apple nor Intel would specify the exact chips that will be used.
Jobs did say that Intel's focus on power management, crucial to extending battery life on portable computers, was as important as performance in the decision.
The switch ends years of squabbling between Apple and its chip suppliers, IBM and Freescale Semiconductor Inc., which was spun off from Motorola last year.
When Motorola was the supplier of G4 chips for Macs, Apple grew frustrated with the rate of improvement.
In 2002, it signed a deal with IBM to provide advanced chips for its high end desktop computers, the Power Mac G5.
But the IBM Apple deal was rocky almost from the start.
Jobs said Macs would top 3 gigahertz in processing speed by last summer, but IBM did not deliver.
The IBM chips also were scarce for desktop computers and nonexistent for notebooks, which by some measures have now begun to outsell PCs in the United States.
They simply ran too hot and consumed too much electricity for portables.
Though the Mac could benefit from Intel's chips, skeptical analysts questioned whether it was worth the risk.
In the past, major transitions have led to defections by customers and software developers, said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at the research firm Insight 64.
In the mid 1980s, the Mac captured as much as 10 percent of the overall PC market, he said.
But when Apple switched from Motorola 68000 processors to PowerPC chips, the Mac's share dropped to below 5 percent.
When the Mac's operating system later changed to OS X, it fell to below 3 percent.
"I have a lot of trouble understanding why they would do it," Brookwood said of the transition to Intel processors.
"Unless there's something magical, I would have to believe it's not a good move."
By wrestling away Apple's business from IBM, Intel gains further dominance of the PC processor business.
It currently has 80 percent market share.
Paul Otellini, Intel's new chief executive, said the chip maker was pleased to have Apple as a customer.
"I suspect there is a whole bunch of you that never thought you would see this logo on this stage," he said onstage with Jobs.
"I was one of them for a while."
Although IBM and Freescale suffer a setback with the loss of Apple, Mac chip sales were just a fraction of their total semiconductor revenues.
Both said it allows them to focus on more promising, non PC businesses.
Recently, IBM has signed deals to provide the chips for the next generation video game machines of Microsoft, Nintendo Co. and Sony Corp. A new microprocessor that IBM co developed with Sony and Toshiba Corp., code named Cell and planned for Sony's next PlayStation console, is being touted as capable of delivering 10 times the performance of today's PC processors.
AP Technology Writer Greg Sandoval reported from San Francisco, and Matthew Fordahl reported from Salinas, Calif.
Green Mountain Energy is offering Texas electricity consumers an environmentally friendly service at a rate matching that of Reliant Energy a sign of a growing interest in green energy and the rising price of traditionally produced power.
Touted as a "pollution free" plan, Green Mountain Energy gets the power it sells from wind turbines and hydroelectric plants and will cost about 11.1 cents per kilowatt hour, the same price current Reliant Energy customers are paying.
Houston area electricity customers can pay as little as 9.6 cents per kilowatt hour, a rate offered by Houston based Gexa Energy.
Other companies, like Starlight Electric and Cirro Energy, also offer rates below the price Reliant charges.
The Green Mountain plan, a 10 percent wind and 90 percent water generated mix, is about $9 per month less expensive than the 100 percent wind plan Austin based Green Mountain currently offers, based on the use by a typical customer.
The new offering reflects a maturing of the electricity market from one where only early adopters would pay the extra money for green power to a market where renewable power is attractive to a broader range of customers, said John Savage, Green Mountain's senior vice president of marketing.
"Some see it as a way to counter the country's dependence on foreign oil, others see it as a way to promote good environmental stewardship, and others see it as being consistent with their faith."
Savage said.
The power in Green Mountain's 100 percent wind plan comes from turbines operating in Texas, but most of the hydroelectric power in the new plan is generated in neighboring states, such as Arkansas and Oklahoma, Savage said.
While the power that arrives at a Green Mountain customer's home in Texas won't necessarily be from a hydroelectric plant, Green Mountain will buy a sort of "renewable power credit" from a hydro plant that generated the electricity and sold it to another user.
Green Mountain's plan also reflects the narrowing price gap between renewable power and power made by more traditional methods, such as coal and natural gas, said Tim Morstad, an analyst with Consumers Union.
Since 2002, the price electric consumers pay to Reliant Energy, known as the price to beat, has gone up 28 percent, or 2.48 cents per kilowatt hour.
Most of that is a result of rising costs, primarily natural gas.
"On the renewable front, it does bode well that customers can choose more environmentally friendly power for the price most residential customers pay," Morstad said.
"But this is also a signal that the price to beat has gotten very high."
The cost of renewable energy hasn't necessarily dropped, either.
While the cost of wind power is supposed to stay relatively stable compared with power generated by coal and natural gas, Green Mountain recently increased the price of its 100 percent wind product.
Because the company must buy some power on the open market to meet customer needs, it is also subject to the fuel price increases imposed by its suppliers, Savage said.
Reliant Energy does not offer a renewable energy plan in the Houston area state electricity deregulation laws allow it to offer only one plan here until Jan 1, 2005 but it has offered a plan to Dallas area customers for several years.
Jim Robb, Reliant's senior vice president of retail marketing, said the renewable plan has been priced to roughly match the cost of the Dallas area's incumbent provider, TXU.
The power comes from a combination of wind and landfill produced natural gas.
"We haven't seen major evidence of increased interest in a renewable product," Robb said, noting that about 1400 customers have signed on to its plan.
"We could offer such a plan in Houston next year if we find customer demand, but we haven't gone to the expense of marketing the plan."
There are no other renewable energy plans offered in the Houston area.
Spokesmen for Entergy and TXU note that renewable sources are part of their mix of power generation.
TXU is the fourth largest contractor of wind power in the country, while Entergy has several hydroelectric facilities.
Green Mountain has 600000 customers in eight states but does not offer a state by state breakdown.
Colorado utilities will have to sell a lot more electricity from wind power in years to come under a statewide ballot initiative approved by voters on Nov 2, and if they want some pointers they might talk to Adam T. Kremers, a 19 year old sophomore at Colorado State University here.
He's been there and done that.
Kremers sold wind power to the occupants of individual dormitory rooms this fall, under a deal between the university and the local utility that environmentalists describe as one of the first such programs in the nation.
Kremers, an environmental engineering major and the associate director of environmental affairs in the student government, gave out stickers and pinwheels shaped like turbines and threw a "wind power party" to celebrate clean energy, complete with a cake connived from the dining hall.
He ultimately got 187 students nearly 4 percent of the university's 5000 residence hall population to sign up, paying from $17 to $52 a year extra to buy green power to run their computers and lava lamps.
"It's a start," he said.
"Now it's my duty to keep it going."
Colorado voters said much the same thing when they approved, over the vehement objections of most energy companies, a proposal mandating that 10 percent of the state's electricity must come from wind and solar power by 2015.
The new law, called Amendment 37, makes Colorado the 18th state with an environmentally friendly energy standard, but the first one to have bypassed the Legislature and put the rule into place through referendum.
An energy bill similar to the one the voters approved was defeated by Colorado's legislature three times in the last three years.
"Because it's a conservative Western state with a strong fossil fuel industry, as well as the first one passed by a popular referendum, Colorado represents something of a breakthrough," said Alan Nogee, the energy program director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit research and advocacy group based in Cambridge, Mass. And Fort Collins, a city of 118000 people dominated culturally by the 25000 student university got there first.
The city created its own wind energy program in 1998, and its own renewable energy standard in 2003 a step that only a few other municipalities in the nation, notably Chicago and Austin, Texas, have taken.
Under the program, about 2 percent of the city's customer base and electricity load now comes from wind power, purchased from wind farms in Wyoming through a nonprofit power authority.
The idea is that each purchase of wind power fed into the grid offsets fossil fuel use.
Colorado gets most of its electricity from burning coal.
It was from that municipal utility framework, city and school officials say, that the dormitory project took root.
And just like Amendment 37, which clawed its way onto the ballot through petitions, what happened on the campus came entirely from the bottom up.
People like Kremers and a former student, Britta Schroeder, his predecessor at the student government's environment job, prodded and pushed until they found a way.
"It was almost all exclusively the students doing this," said Carol Dollard, a utility engineer at the university who got involved in the residence hall project.
The pitch to the administration, she said, was that wind energy would be an entirely optional added cost for students, and that the grunt work would be done by the students themselves.
"We sold it as zero cost, zero effort," she said.
Kremers, who has a quotation from Gandhi on the door of his dorm room "Be the change you wish to see in the world" considers the new state law a wonderful boost to what's happening on campus.
Fort Collins officials are more guarded.
They say that as one of a small number of "home rule" cities that run their own electric systems in Colorado, they want to opt out of the new state law because they believe their energy program is better.
It is certainly more ambitious, requiring 15 percent of the energy sold in city limits to come from wind sources by 2017, 50 percent more than the state requirement.
City officials also don't like the idea of interference by the state Public Utility Commission, which will oversee the statewide standards, and they worry as well that the Legislature could amend the plan.
The Fort Collins city council voted to remain neutral on Amendment 37 before the election.
Statewide, the measure got the support of slightly more than half the electorate 53.4 percent voted for it, to 46.6 percent against.
"Does the PUC have jurisdiction over a home rule city?
That's what people were worried about," said Michael B. Smith, the general manager of utilities for Fort Collins.
"We will be closely watching what happens."
Environmentalists who backed Amendment 37 noted that it includes specific language intended to protect Fort Collins, and other cities that might join its ranks with local standards, allowing them to self certify out of the program.
But they also admitted that because the measure was passed as an ordinary state law, it could be amended by the Legislature or repealed, though hardly anyone expects that to happen and that the Public Utility Commission will also have to work out the details of enacting it over the next year.
"It's a statute, so the legislature can change it however it sees fit, but I would hope that since it was passed by the voice of the people, they would respect that," said the measure's principal author, Rick Gilliam, a senior energy policy adviser at Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit environment law and policy center.
"My hope is that we would at least go forward into the PUC realm before the legislature tinkers with it."
At the university, plans are under way for next year's wind campaign.
Dollard, the utility engineer, said that one proposal would extend the wind power option to individual professors, and departments that might want to buy some or all their energy from the city's wind program.
"It was a three year process to get the residence halls through, so we've said let's not take on too many things until we've learned the lessons from the first part," she said.
Kremers, meanwhile, is plotting how to get financing for his second year marketing plan.
He wants to print up advertising cards that could be put in every mailbox of next year's incoming freshman class about 5000 students and he has a strategy in mind.
The university's recycling committee, mostly composed of faculty and administration, works on issues like reducing waste in the dining halls, and he is the student representative on the board.
"The recycling committee has a good budget," he said.
"We'll see."
There is a "think globally, act locally" rightness to the fact that the environmental report for the Cape Wind power project came on the same day scientists laid out the dramatic effects global warming is having on the Arctic.
The report on Cape Wind's 130 turbine proposal finds few costs to marine or bird life that might outweigh the project's benefits to both the environment and the economy.
The 454 megawatt project would provide a source of pollution free, renewable power that could displace fossil fuel sources in the region.
Unless the United States and the rest of the world get serious about global warming and sea level increases, the Cape town of Orleans could be "under the waves" by 2100, according to Philip Warburg, president of the Conservation Law Foundation.
Much of that increased ocean water will come from the Arctic.
It is warming more than the rest of the planet, according to the report by the eight nation Arctic Council, which includes the United States.
As ice and snow at the poles melt, the loss of their reflective surfaces leads to exposed land and water absorbing more heat.
The four year study by 300 international researchers advances the consensus among scientists that industrial society's increasing production of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, is causing climate change.
The Bush administration has refused to take any steps to curb carbon dioxide emissions despite a promise by President Bush in 2000 to do so, and has indicated it has no plans to change that policy.
This leaves it up to states like Massachusetts, which requires utilities to increase annually their use of renewable power sources, and California, which is pioneering a requirement that motor vehicles reduce their carbon emissions.
If Washington cannot take the lead in coping with climate change, the least it could do is provide legislation for a better framework for wind or other renewable energy projects that use the ocean surface.
But Congress has not made significant progress in passing a bill to create a leasing system for sites similar to one that exists for offshore oil and gas drilling.
The lack of such a framework is no reason to stall the Cape Wind project, which is now a step closer to becoming a model for offshore wind power generation.
Using current technology, it is more practical to build offshore turbines fairly close to land, which means they can be visible in nearby communities.
The environmental report, prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers, includes a "visual impact assessment" by an architectural historian who states that the turbines "will have an adverse visual effect" on historic properties and locations in the area.
That may not be pleasant for some residents, but the supposed harm to a view is more than offset by the beneficial impact of the clean Cape Wind power.
Nantucket Sound lies between Cape Cod, Nantucket Island and Martha's Vineyard, some of the nation's best known vacation spots.
Now a private company is proposing to build the world's largest offshore wind power plant right in the middle of it.
Depending on who is talking, the results would be either a hideous blot on the landscape or a significant step toward clean power and energy independence.
The argument over the proposal intensified last week, when the Army Corps of Engineers issued a draft environmental impact statement finding few flaws in the proposal.
But instead of helping to settle the question, the report fed the debate over building there and where or whether other wind farms should be built in the nation's coastal waters.
The 4000 page draft gives new support to environmental groups that praise the project as a safe, nonpolluting and desperately needed alternative to fossil fuel power plants.
But opponents challenge the report, the process that produced it and the idea of building the turbine array in the first place.
Regardless of its environmental impact, they say, it is just too ugly an industrial development that would wreck pristine vistas in a major tourism area.
Many add that no offshore energy projects should be considered until the government establishes a better review process for proposals to use federal lands offshore.
The project would be the nation's first offshore wind power plant, and it is being closely watched up and down the Eastern Seaboard.
A similar proposal is under consideration off Jones Beach, on Long Island, and officials in New Jersey are looking into offshore wind power.
The Corps of Engineers' draft concluded that the project, proposed by Cape Wind Associates of Boston, would not unduly hinder ferry operations, commercial and sport fishing, boating, aviation or other activities at its site, a 24 square mile area in the part of Nantucket Sound called Horseshoe Shoals.
It said the project's 130 support towers, turbines and blades, which together would rise about 420 feet above the water, would not seriously affect currents, waves, water quality, sand movement, fishing conditions or noise levels.
Adequate steps can be taken to protect marine mammals and shellfish, the report said.
Birds will fly into the towers and die, the statement says, but probably at a rate of only about one a day, not enough "to cause bird population declines."
And while opponents predict that the field of towers would drive away tourists, the corps said the project might actually attract sightseers.
The report is preliminary, and the public will have at least until Jan 10 to comment on its findings, said Karen Adams, who supervises the permit process for the Corps of Engineers.
A final environmental review may be completed as soon as a year from now, she said.
Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for Cape Wind, said the company must still raise the capital needed to build the project.
But if all goes well, he said, the plant could be producing power as early as 2007.
The power would go into the regional grid, not precisely to Cape Cod and the islands, he said.
But on a day with average wind, it would produce about 420 megawatts three fourths of average electricity needs for the local area.
"Many of the more hysterical fears that opponents had been speaking of in the past three years were not supported in this analysis," Rodgers said of the impact statement.
But that is no surprise, according to the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, an organization that opposes the wind farm.
As is required, Cape Wind paid for the work that went into the report.
"As a predictable result," the alliance said in a statement, "the document is strongly biased toward Cape Wind."
Adams and the project's supporters dismiss that criticism.
The corps requires applicants to pay for studies of their proposals, she said, because it would not be right for taxpayers to pay for them.
The corps independently chose the experts who produced each section of the report, she said, and Cape Wind willingly financed whatever the work the corps requested.
She added, however, that some in the corps did not expect to find themselves in the position of issuing federal permits for the project.
"We had to do a lot of learning real quick," she said.
But some officials including Gov. Mitt Romney, Sen Edward M. Kennedy and Rep Bill Delahunt, whose congressional district includes the project site, say the project should not go forward yet.
They say offshore projects of all kinds need a more systematic federal review process.
(Sen John Kerry says he will await the final environmental impact statement before taking a position.)
Advocates of the wind farm say establishing such a process would only mean unnecessary delay.
And several environmental organizations have found themselves in the unaccustomed position of praising the Corps of Engineers, which many have criticized in the past as being too quick to approve development projects.
"At first, obviously, it was pretty frightening because of their history," said Kert Davies, U.S. research director for Greenpeace, which favors the project.
But he added, "I think the effort was very solid, and they were under a lot of scrutiny."
Davies also dismissed as "an elitist and local view" assertions that the wind turbine array would spoil a pristine environment.
Nantucket Sound is far from that, he said, filled as it is with "mega boat traffic and jet skis and fishing boats and ferries it is not the Grand Canyon these guys are painting it to be."
Others say that regulatory issues aside, the aesthetics are perhaps the biggest issue standing in the project's way.
"It's a legitimate concern," said Bruce Bailey of AWS Truewind, a research firm in Albany, N.Y., that consulted on the Cape Wind project.
But, he said, "It's based on expectations, not based on what people have actually seen."
He said photo simulations of what the wind farm will look like from shore it will be 4.7 miles away at its closest point assume the clearest of weather conditions.
Often, he said, the distant view from shore is obscured by haze, so the turbines would not be so obvious.
Besides, advocates say, a diminished view is a small price to pay for clean power.
"If we are not willing to accept that tradeoff, I think it says something pretty profound about our priorities and our commitment to moving to cleaner sources of electricity," said Randy Swisher, executive director of the American Wind Energy Association, which represents developers, suppliers, consultants and others in the wind power industry.
The corps' statement did not address in detail another criticism opponents have voiced: that the project is economically viable only because of tax credits or because the federal government is giving the company free use of the site, issues that some say should be considered in a broader federal review of development of offshore lands.
But advocates contend that all kinds of fossil fuel energy projects benefit from federal incentives.
And Rodgers, the Cape Wind spokesman, said that "non extractive" users of coastal lands companies that run telecommunications cables and the like are not required to pay for the privilege.
Still, he said, should the federal government decide to require lease payments, the company would "absolutely" pay.
Rodgers said the site offered several important advantages.
It is in the middle of an area whose population and electricity demands are growing.
And it is a short distance to Barnstable, where power generated by the windmills can feed into the national grid.
Similar considerations are prompting interest in offshore wind power on Long Island and in New Jersey, several experts said.
"It's difficult to site a large wind development in the Northeast," Swisher said.
Advocates of wind power cite Denmark as an example, saying the country generates 20 percent or more of its energy from wind, and Davies of Greenpeace says the record there suggests that offshore wind farms can become tourism destinations.
"In Denmark, day sailors take off and sail to these things," he said.
He and others at environmental groups said they hoped the Cape Wind proposal would win final approval and would become the first of many offshore wind projects.
"The United States," he said, "is way behind in the clean energy race."
Ugliness can be good for you especially if you are not rich, powerful, or politically connected.
After a massive draft environmental analysis, the controversial proposal to construct a wind farm in Nantucket Sound is coming down to aesthetics.
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney a supposedly pro business, anti government regulation, cold blooded venture capitalist made that clear during recent testimony before the US Army Corps of Engineers.
"We cannot trash this extraordinary resource," Romney said, referring to Nantucket Sound. "
,I've seen wind farms, and they are not pretty."
Two days later, the Romney administration announced support for windmill projects in Florida and Monroe in western Massachusetts.
Residents there also worry about the aesthetics of 20 340 foot tall turbines and the overall impact on streams, wetlands, and woodland.
And that raises a question: With government under pressure to develop renewable energy, will controversial alternatives be foisted solely on poorer, less politically influential areas?
The proposed Nantucket Sound project would be the country's first offshore wind farm.
The structures would stretch 417 feet high from the water's surface to the tallest blade tip and would be visible 4 miles away on Cape Cod and more distantly from Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.
Some environmental groups, including the Conservation Law Foundation and Greenpeace believe the trade off in terms of energy and pollution savings is worth it.
But Cape Wind Associates, the developer behind the proposal, is fighting the wealthy and well connected, including Senator Edward M. Kennedy and other Kennedy kin along with some average Cape residents.
As for Romney's loud opposition, the governor could be feeling pressure from Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly's strong effort to challenge the project.
Or, perhaps he is feeling another type of pressure?
Opposition to Cape Wind is organized through the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, which spent $2.4 million fighting the proposed wind farm in 2003.
On forms filed with the IRS in 2003, Christopher, Jack, and Michael Egan are listed as directors.
Jack and Michael Egan are current board members.
They are sons of Richard Egan, founder and chairman emeritus of EMC Corp.
The Egans are major political players.
Here, while they also contribute to Democrats, they are big Romney fund raisers.
The Egan Family Foundation was the main funding source for a $100000 survey done by the Beacon Hill Institute.
It concluded that lower property values, reduced tourism revenue, and a loss in year round jobs would result from the wind farm.
The Egan Family Trust owns property in Cotuit overlooking Nantucket Sound, and Michael Egan owns a home on Great Island, off Yarmouth, overlooking Nantucket Sound.
Ernie Corrigan, a spokesman for the alliance, said, "This is not a political issue at all."
Opposition is "a matter of common sense."
Asked if the Egan family involvement influenced Romney's position regarding Cape Wind, Romney aide Eric Fehrnstrom replied via e mail: "No, not at all."
Asked to explain Romney's shifting positions, Fehrnstrom, said, again via e mail: "Gov. Romney supports efforts to encourage greater reliance on renewable sources of energy.
There are several areas in the Berkshires region where wind farms have recently been approved.
And there are a number of different areas off the coast of Massachusetts that we could also consider.
They may not be optimal for the developer from a profit making point of view, but we need to balance the public and private interest.
Nantucket Sound is a national treasure.
The governor does not want to turn it into a wind factory.
He wouldn't recommend putting a wind farm in the middle of the Grand Canyon, or at the foot of Mount Rushmore, either.
In the Berkshires, legal challenges are underway.
Under the current plan, "a year from now, turbine number 16 will be the third highest point in Massachusetts," says Eleanor Tillinghast, co founder of Green Berkshires, Inc., a group formed to oppose wind farm power.
"We believe the aesthetics are equally as valuable here.
Nantucket Sound is a national treasure, so are the mountains of western Massachusetts."
But, she says, western Massachusetts is being left to the mercies of the free market system, where small towns suffering from budget cutbacks are "willing to sell their wind, because what else do they have to sell?"
What a sorry way to run a state energy policy: Give to the have nots what the haves don't want.

Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) will invest more than NT$10 billion in developing wind power generation in the next 10 years, a company spokesman said Sunday.
The 10 year development plan is part of the state owed firm's efforts to substantiate the government's eco friendly "green power generation" policy.
Under the plan, Taipower will install at least 200 wind power generators with a total installed capacity of 300000 kilowatts, the spokesman said, adding that the wind power generators will first be set up in coastal regions in western part of the island.
An amendment to the 2005 defense authorization bill currently before Congress could immediately halt the development of offshore wind power facilities in the United States, including a controversial project planned for coastal Massachusetts, environmental groups and developers said this week.
The amendment is being pushed by Sen John Warner, R Va., who sits on the House Senate conference committee that will write the final version of the bill.
The amendment would prevent the Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees offshore wind power, from processing permit applications until lawmakers draw up new regulatory guidelines.
Proponents of the Massachusetts project say the amendment would stifle a burgeoning industry that they believe can make the United States less reliant on polluting fossil fuels at a time of rising oil prices.
Warner, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the amendment is necessary to address shortcomings in oversight for such projects.
"We need a more comprehensive regime, not unlike that for offshore drilling in the oil and gas industry, to protect this very important concept of wind energy, which I support," he said in a telephone interview.
He would not disclose whether the amendment will be included in the committee's report, which could come as soon as Friday.
Once the bill is written, no changes can be made before a vote on passage.
Although in its nascent stages in this country, wind power is widely used in Europe providing Denmark, for example, with about 18 percent of its energy.
The first offshore project planned for U.S. waters is a privately financed, $800 million proposal to build 130 turbines south of Cape Cod, Mass. Cape Wind Associates, the project's developer, says that in normal weather conditions, 40 story high towers could generate 170 megawatts 75 percent of the power used by Cape Cod and the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.
"This amendment would stop us dead in our tracks, putting the breaks on offshore wind energy for years to come," said Mark Rogers, communications director for Cape Wind.
The Cape Cod proposal has sparked a strong backlash from a coalition of wealthy and well connected opponents, including some environmentalists.
They say it will spoil the aesthetics of popular vacation communities, disrupt commercial fishing, and harm birds and marine wildlife.
A 4000 page draft environmental impact study by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was completed last month after a nearly three year process.
It was set to be released last month, but a Pentagon official asked to review it first.
"This project has undergone extensive environmental review, and the public has a right to learn what the implications of it will be," said Philip Warburg, president of the Conservation Law Foundation.
"Clearly, there are powerful forces in Congress opposed to moving this project forward."
A draft of the amendment, circulated this week, calls on Congress to outline environmental standards, establish requirements for competitive bidding and set public compensation for the use of waterways.
Some of those issues were raised in a report last month by the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, which called the current regulatory framework for offshore wind power "inadequate."
Sen Edward Kennedy, D Mass., who serves on the Armed Services Committee and whose family owns a large home on Cape Cod, has spoken out against the project and supports establishing a national policy on offshore development.
Warner, who has two daughters with summer homes on Cape Cod, wrote in a 2002 letter to Army Undersecretary Les Brownlee that "the location of such a large project on Nantucket Sound is questionable."
Warner said that the amendment is not related to his families ties to Cape Cod and that he is mainly concerned with providing a framework for wind power developments in Virginia.
A company called Winergy LLC applied for an offshore wind farm permit from the Norfolk District of the Army Corps of Engineers, but that application has been withdrawn.
In New York, the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) plans to build 40 wind turbines off southern Long Island as part of a state program that requires utilities to produce 25 percent of their energy portfolio from renewable sources by 2013.
"We would be discouraged by any effort that would prevent us from moving forward with this important project," LIPA Chairman Richard Kessel said.
Near this blustery headland where Admiral Nelson won his great naval victory over the French two centuries ago, a new battle of Trafalgar is brewing.
But the ships involved today are only small fishing boats, wanting to protect their livelihood.
Two companies plan to build large clusters of windmills in the sea just off this stretch of Spain's southern shore, a gritty place of sand dunes, lagoons and sharp brown reefs.
With about 400 offshore turbines, they want to capture the power of the winds that blow almost constantly here, at the cusp of two seas, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.
Fishermen respond that these phalanxes of giant towers near the coast will make their tough jobs even more difficult.
"This is where the tuna pass and this is where we work," said Manuel Ponce Alva, leader of fishermen's protest movement, waving a marine map covered with ominous red arrows.
The men from the fishing villages of Barbate, Vejer and Conil have knocked on many official doors to argue that these wind farms will disturb the migration of the young tuna and, more dramatically, that their own lives may be at stake.
They say the towers, to be based some 10 miles offshore, will force their small vessels to make large detours in the already treacherous waters near the Strait of Gibraltar.
"We talk and talk, and we ask," said Antonio Varo, another angry fisherman.
"We get no answers."
Their protests may well fall on deaf ears.
The windmill projects are part of a drive by Spain to expand its output of native renewable energy.
Spain is already one of Europe's largest producers of wind power, second only to Germany, and its present capacity of 8500 megawatts can supply close to 5 percent of the country's electricity.
Indications are that this may double by 2010.
In this country, where almost all oil, gas and coal must be imported, the wind rush has been under way for more than a decade.
Privately owned "wind parks," encouraged by official subsidies, first sprouted on the hills near here, behind Trafalgar and Tarifa.
The gleaming white towers then spread to the rest of the country, to the windswept north and the central highlands.
Like the old stone windmills that have dotted Spanish horizons for centuries, the modern turbines are all on land.
But now Spanish entrepreneurs want to join Europe's booming new trend of building large wind farms offshore.
The seabed off Cape Trafalgar, one of six marine sites being studied, is a favorite.
There are no important tourist resorts nearby, although visitors often come here from Britain, where "Trafalgar" has a special ring.
Binoculars in hand, people climb to the tip of the cape, a knobby dune with a lighthouse on top.
Here they peer out at the water where 60 British, French and Spanish warships clashed in 1805 in the battle that established Britain's naval supremacy for the next century.
Cesar del Campo, director of a consortium involved in the wind park plans, said the site is difficult because of the water depth and the speed of the currents, but that the energy yield would be high.
"You have to see the Strait of Gibraltar like a huge fast moving river that changes with the tides," he said.
"Some days there may be heavy gusts from Atlantic storms, but you can count on wind every day."
The building cost can be twice as high as on land, though, offsetting the larger yield.
It means driving piles into the sea floor, laying cables to the shore and doing riskier maintenance work.
But specialists say the rush is on now for offshore wind energy, and northern Europe is leading the way.
Wind farms based at sea today still have a modest capacity of 600 megawatts, but this is expected to grow more than tenfold by 2010, said Corin Millais, director of the European Wind Energy Association.
Companies, including utilities, have staked out tracts in the seas off Britain, Denmark, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands.
The incentive is evident, Millais said, because Europe's oil and natural gas reserves are running out and energy imports, now at 50 percent, will rise further.
The European Union, moreover, has been pushing for alternatives to fossil fuels as part of its commitment under the Kyoto treaty to reduce greenhouse gases, and it wants 22 percent of its electricity to come from renewable sources by 2010.
Many projects have been delayed because officials everywhere are demanding stringent environmental impact studies.
These are still under way for the Trafalgar wind fields, and it remains to be seen whether they will support the fishermen's position.
The area is on the flight path of tens of thousands of eagles, ducks, storks, swallows and many other birds crossing to winter in Africa.
Daniel Lopez Marijuan, of the association of Ecologists in Action said, "The first studies have shown that migrating birds do not fly very low here, unless a storm takes them off their course."
There are other stakeholders, including two nearby NATO bases, the operators of a gas duct that comes to Spain from North Africa and the heavy shipping traffic in and out of the Mediterranean, but planners say their studies show the windmills pose no obstruction.
If that is true, the fishermen along the Trafalgar coast may be alone in confronting the powerful lobby of wind producers.
"There is good money in wind," said Rafael Bayo, an engineer and energy consultant.
"That is why many hilltops now have windmills.
A farmer used to get nothing from his hill, now he rents it to a utility or puts his own windmills there."
This may continue, he believes, as long as the government pays grid operators the difference between conventional and wind generated electricity, on average two or three cents per kilowatt hour.
Eventually, some experts think, wind power may become competitive as turbines get bigger and as pollution taxes are imposed on fossil fuel energy, as planned.
Manuel Bustos, who represents the association of wind producers, said his group would try to convince the fishermen that they may benefit from the offshore project.
He said that in European pilot projects, fish farms have been attached to sea based windmills.
In another experiment, the underwater base of the mill was used to create artificial reefs to act as fish nurseries.
At Barbate, the fishermen said they had never heard of this.
Should the Trafalgar plans fail, then offshore parks may go elsewhere, given the Spaniards' hunger for wind profits.
"There are dozens of projects waiting for licenses, on land and offshore," Bustos said.
"Enough to produce another 50000 megawatts."
As the clock begins ticking Tuesday toward a final decision on the proposed wind farm in Nantucket Sound, its chief opponent said the government should allow more time for public response to a crucial 4000 page report that appears to pave the way for its approval.
The new draft environmental impact report, prepared over three years by the Army Corps of Engineers, will be released in full Tuesday, but supporters and opponents responded to details that became public Monday morning.
The findings are largely favorable to the project, suggesting that the 130 turbines proposed off Cape Cod would have little or no negative effect on the surrounding air, sea, and animal life.
The public has 60 days to comment on the report before the Corps issues a final version and makes a decision on the project, which is expected next year.
The report is by far the most important hurdle the controversial project must overcome before construction begins.
The draft gives the first public look at the federal government's official stance on the 460 megawatt power plant.
The Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, a group founded to block the project, said Monday that it intends to ask the government to extend the comment period to six months, saying that two months is too little time for the public to digest the enormous amount of information in the Army Corps report.
"A 60 day comment period during the holiday season on a complex and controversial project is unfair," said Susan Nickerson, of the alliance.
Army Corps officials said Monday they would consider written requests to extend the comment period, but had already added 15 days to the minimum required time of 45 days.
Even though few had seen the entire report by Monday afternoon, reaction was swift from opponents and supporters after details were published by news agencies and summaries of the report were leaked.
The two sides have begun lining up engineers and scientists to start poring over the document.
"The struggle has just begun," said Charles Kleekamp, vice president of Cape Clean Air, an environmental group that supports the farm.
Governor Mitt Romney, who opposes the project on aesthetic grounds, says the report downplays a key consideration for Massachusetts residents.
"I'm not surprised that the wind farm isn't going to kill fish or kill birds," said Romney.
"The question is does the wind farm impinge on the beauty of one of the great natural resources on the East Coast, and it does."
Monday, the Army Corps of Engineers said few projects are blocked because of aesthetic considerations, in part because it is such a subjective matter.
Supporters of wind farms have called the proposed turbines "futuristic" and "beautiful," while opponents have called them a blight on an uninterrupted seascape.
The Nantucket Sound wind farm, proposed by Cape Wind Associates, would be the country's first offshore wind farm.
A host of politicians have attempted to block the project since it was proposed three years ago.
If the Army Corps sticks to the 60 day public comment period, the agency is likely to issue a decision next year.
Construction could begin soon afterward.
"This is great news for citizens hoping to turn decades of rhetoric into action on renewable energy," Cape Wind president Jim Gordon said, referring to the report's findings.
The $13 million draft environmental impact report was paid for by Cape Wind.
Some 16 agencies and groups weighed in with comments and data about potential impacts the farm would have, and the Army Corps received hundreds of individual comments.
Cape Wind's involvement in the report has drawn critics, including Nickerson, who says the Army Corps was overly reliant on data collected by consultants paid for by the developer.
They also faulted the Army Corps' hiring of TRC, a national engineering firm with an office in Lowell, to help put the federal document together.
Nickerson said TRC would be bound to write a favorable review because it works on wind issues, among others.
Army Corps officials said they specifically hired TRC as an independent third party because they have an energy background and experience with similar reports.
A spokeswoman for TRC said Nickerson's comments were untrue.
"TRC deals with all kinds of energy.
The idea they would be biased to any particular energy source is ridiculous," said spokeswoman Samantha Guerry.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, whose family compound would overlook the project, issued a statement saying the project shows the need for better rules to govern what he sees as the bequeathing of public ocean to private interests.
Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly said "We cannot allow the federal government to give away 24 square miles of pristine waters to a private developer,W hat is happening here is wrong."
With promises of an enormous fight brewing, both sides remained optimistic.
Marc Breslow, director of the Massachusetts Climate Action Network, which supports the plan, said he had only seen a brief summary of the report Monday, but if it is accurate, "completion of a final environmental report should be done expeditiously, and assuming no environmental surprises, Cape Wind should move forward without further delay."

Wind turbines have been hailed as an environmentally friendly way to reduce the world's dependence on fossil fuels.
But a wind farm with hundreds or even thousands of large turbines removes an enormous amount of energy from the air.
So is wind power really benign?
In one of the first studies to get at that question, scientists have modeled the impact of a hypothetical large scale wind farm in the Great Plains.
Their conclusion, reported in The Journal of Geophysical Research, is that thousands of turbines concentrated in one area can affect local weather.
The impact, said the study's lead author, Dr Somnath Baidya Roy, comes not so much from the turbines' rotor blades slowing down the air but from atmospheric mixing that occurs in the blades' wake.
This creates warmer, drier conditions at the surface.
"We found that it's the turbulence generated by the rotor that is crucial when you talk about the impact on local meteorology," said Baidya Roy, who did the research at Princeton but is now at Duke.
The simulated wind farm in the study consisted of 10000 turbines, with rotor blades 165 feet long, in a 60 by 60 mile grid in north central Oklahoma.
In the Great Plains there is a nighttime stream of fast moving air that separates cool, moist air near the ground from drier, warmer air above.
The simulation found that the turbines catch this nocturnal jet, and the ensuing turbulence causes vertical mixing.
The warming and drying that occur when the upper air mass reaches the surface is a significant change, Baidya Roy said, and is similar to the kinds of local atmospheric changes that occur with large scale deforestation.
"You might see some kind of convective clouds or scattered rainfall here and there," Baidya Roy said.
He noted that the study was only preliminary, but that it pointed to the need to improve rotor design to reduce turbulence.
A wind farm of the size used in the simulation is much larger than those that have been built so far, Baidya Roy acknowledged, but it is not out of line with what is being considered as more power from renewable resources is sought.
"When you think of wind energy, people have a quaint idea of a lone windmill by the river," he said.
"We are quite a ways from that, actually."
On the site where border guards used to keep watch on the western outpost of the Soviet Union, Baltic European Union newcomer Estonia is erecting a wind farm to generate clean electricity.
The wind swept Pakri peninsula, which juts into the Baltic Sea 60 kilometres (36 miles) west of the capital Tallinn, once hosted a training centre for Soviet border guards.
The nearby town of Paldiski was a key Soviet nuclear submarine training ground.
Today, sleek silver arms of the state of art wind power turbines dot the site which was off limits to civilians throughout the five decades of Soviet occupation from 1940 to 1991.
The first three windmills of the Pakri Wind Farm have just been put into operation, with five others to follow before the end of the month.
When the farm is fully up and running, it is expected to supply one percent of Estonia's energy needs, and a some 10000 Estonian households are expected to get electricity from the farm.
"Paldiski has been associated with the Soviet border guards and military pollution," said Hannu Lamp, managing director of the Tuulepargid company which is developing the wind farm.
"From now on, it will have a new side to it, as a clean energy place."
Tuulepargid is the Estonian subsidiary of Danish based Global Green Energy.
The streamlined wind turbines with a hub height of 80 metres (yards) and rotor diamete 3800 residents has struggled with its Soviet military legacy.
In addition to changing the face of Paldiski, the Parki Wind Farm is setting a precedent in the region in the carbon pollution quota market.
Under the Kyoto Protocol's implementation project, 0.5 million tons of reduced greenhouse gas emissions will be sold to Finland.
"It's among the very first wind power projects anywhere where the economic feasibility is achieved through the sale of CO2 reductions under the joint implementation scheme of the Kyoto Protocol," Lamp says.
On January 1, the EU opened a market for trading in carbon dioxide and other gases which are the main culprits for global warming.
The total investment cost of the Pakri project is 24 million euros.
The wind farm owner, Pakri Tuulepark, is a subsidiary of Norway's Vardar energy group.
Most of Estonia's energy is generated using oil shale fueled power plants, which are big pollutants.
With an expected annual production of 56 GWh (GigaWatt hours), the Pakri wind farm will meet about one per cent of Estonia's net electricity consumption, and thus contribute to achieving Estonia's target of providing 5.1 percent of its electricity needs from renewable sources by 2010.
Developers have already made plans for building more wind farms on other former Soviet military installations in Estonia.
In a move that could give Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney more power over the proposed Cape Cod wind farm, state and federal officials appear to have come up with a unique plan: Move the coastline.
State officials said Tuesday that a pile of rocks the size of a sport utility vehicle in Nantucket Sound may redefine the borders of Massachusetts, expanding state waters about 12 square miles.
The expansion would push back federal waters, which could imperil a developer's bid to erect the country's first offshore wind farm, 130 turbines in the sound.
The US Minerals Management Service is expected to post a notice about the border change in the Federal Registry by the end of the month, said Jon Carlisle, a spokesman for the Executive Office of Transportation, which oversees state boundaries.
State waters stretch 3 miles from where officials draw the border.
Federal waters extend from that point to another 200 miles offshore.
"From our review of the landmass, that's the appropriate new border," said Carlisle, who declined to comment on whether Romney pushed for the new borders to curtail the wind project.
"Really one thing has nothing to do with another."
Romney and other state politicians, such as Senator Edward M. Kennedy, oppose the project's planned location, but they have limited power to block it if it is entirely within federal waters.
Last July, Romney asked the Army Corps of Engineers to postpone its long awaited review of the proposed wind farm, arguing the newly discovered rocks might require changing the state border.
If that happened, he suggested in a letter, the developer might have to redraw plans or seek new permits from state agencies.
"This may dramatically alter the proposal your agency is currently reviewing," the governor wrote.
An Army Corps official dismissed the request at the time as a thinly veiled attempt to stop the project.
While details remained sketchy Tuesday night, the new boundary appears to cut into as much as 10 percent of the wind farm's proposed footprint, affecting 10 to 13 turbines, state officials said.
Cape Wind Associates, the project's developer, has seen its proposed turbines become a focal point in a growing national debate over ocean management.
A company official said Tuesday night that they had not seen the proposal, but that they doubted it would seriously affect the project.
The company has already reduced its original proposal by 40 turbines.
A US Army Corps of Engineers draft environmental impact report on the project is in a public comment period until later this month.
The Army Corps is expected to make a final ruling on whether the project can be constructed within the next year, the biggest hurdle that Cape Wind must overcome.
"We are going to await receiving this document, and we want to evaluate it closely before we respond," said Mark Rodgers, a Cape Wind spokesman.
"At this time, it does not appear this will have any significant impact on the Cape Wind Project."
The effort to change the state's borders began about a year ago, after the Minerals Management Service asked the Massachusetts Highway Department to survey the landmass, which is about 2 miles off Cape Cod, Carlisle said.
The Highway Department, which documents state lines, determined the landmass to be a "natural occurrence" and recommended the federal agency change the state's borders, he said.
Globe correspondents Emma Stickgold and Amanda Pinto contributed to this report.
Texas lawmakers are joining clean energy advocates in an effort to dramatically expand the use of wind and solar power and other renewable energy sources across the state.
Texas, the nation's largest electricity consumer, has one of the best renewable energy programs in the country, but some lawmakers and advocates say the state has yet to fully tap those resources.
The resulting savings could dramatically cut electricity bills and power plant pollution.
State Sen Troy Fraser, R Horseshoe Bay, has introduced a bill in the Legislature that would require 10 percent of the state's electricity to come from renewable energy sources by 2025.
The state now mandates that about 2.7 percent be derived from renewable sources by 2009.
"Longterm, this is good public polcy for the state," Fraser said.
"This is a good hedge against fossil fuels and our dependence on foreign oil."
A coalition of clean energy advocates and environmentalists is pushing a stronger proposal.
It would require by 2020 that 20 percent of the state's energy production be derived from renewable energy a whopping 17820 megawatts, or enough electricity to power 4.9 million homes.
The 20 percent proposal does not have a legislative sponsor.
But any expansion of reewable energy will require building miles of transmission lines to carry the electricity produced by wind turbines to urban areas.
The state estimates that it will cost $1 billion to build transmission lines to support an additional 5000 megawatts of wind power.
The money to pay for those transmission lines would probably come from fees based on electricity usage, officials say, meaning industry would be hit hardest.
"I don't want to give the impression that we're not willing to work on the issue, but transmissionto get wind power from West Texas and other remote areas of the state to market can be very expensive," said Phillip Oldham, chief counsel for the Texas Coalition for Competitive Electricity, which represents large commercial and industrial consumers.
"To the extent that renewable energy is cost competitive and beneficial to the state, we have no issue with it being incorporated and think it serves a valuable purpose," he said.
"To the extent that the infrastructre costs outweigh the benefit of it, then we have concerns."
Renewable energy proponents agree that transmission capacity must be improved.
But Tom "Smitty" Smith, a member of the Texas Renewable Energy Industries Association, the clean energy group pushing the 20 percent proposal, said the cost has been exaggerated.
Smith, also director of the Texas chapter of Public Citizen, said the cost would be spread over decades and would add no more than $1.06 to the average monthly residential electricity bill.
The Union f Concerned Scientists, a 100000 member partnership of scientists and citizens, conducted a detailed study of both proposals at the request of the coalition.
The 34 page analysis, released this month, concluded that both proposals would slash residential and industrial energy bills by at least $5.5 billion in the next two decades, as well as create thousands of permanent jobs.
"But the 20 percent standard would actually provide significantly grater economic development and environmental benefits," said Jeff Deyette, an energy analyst with the group.
The union estimates that 38290 jobs would be created by the 20 percent proposal.
It would also slash an estimated 34000 tons of smog forming pollutants a year by curtailing coal fired power plant production, Deyette said.
Fraser said the state needs to proceed cautiously to make sure wind power, in particular, can handle the job.
For instance, Texas' peak electricity demand occurs in Jly, August and September, when the state's winds decline sharply.
"We need to be somewhat deliberate as we go forward in making sure that there's a balance," Fraser said.
"That balance is more than putting in the wind turbines, it's having the transmission to transmit it, and then having a backup source for reliability."
Texas is already a national leader in renewable energy.
In June 1999, the Legislature adopted one of the nation's first, and at the time largest, renewable energy prorams.
"I think it's fair to say that Texas was viewed as a pioneer," said Stephen Wieland, business development manager for Vestas, a Danish wind turbine manufacturer.
Texas set a national record in 2001 by installing more wind power capacity in a single year than any state in any previous year.
Much of the buildup took place at the King Mountain Ranch "wind farm" in McCamey, about 75 miles south of Midland.
It is the world's largest wind power project today.
But in the past several years, 15 states have surpassed Texa' program.
New York, California and Hawaii have enacted requirements that at least 20 percent of energy companies' output be from renewable sources by 2020.

The Netherlands on Wednesday granted licenses for seven offshore wind parks as the country seeks to boost renewable energy sources.
The Ministry of Science said it expected as many as 20 wind farms, with up to 2000 turbines, to be constructed off the North Sea coast in the next few years.
The names of the companies granted construction permission were not released, but the statement said they had applied first and submitted environmental impact studies.
"To reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, the Netherlands has set a target of 6000 megawatts of wind energy," the statement said.
"The first parks will be built by 2006."
Two projects have already begun.
The British energy company BP PLC has started work on a windmill park in the Amsterdam harbor with peak capacity of nine megawatts, enough to provide electrical power to around 5000 houses.
The country's first major offshore wind turbine project, with 100 megawatts of capacity, is under co management by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Cos. and Dutch utilities company Nuon NV.
After four formal hearings, one so packed with passionate speakers that it had to be reconvened for a second time on Tuesday afternoon, the public has just about had its say on a proposal to install a giant wind farm in offshore waters south of Cape Cod.
But consensus appears to be as far away as ever, with advocates and opponents deeply divided on the project and a vast majority still ambivalent.
On Tuesday, the project was variously described as relying on outdated technology or as a beautiful alternative to strip mining, the equivalent of industrializing the Grand Canyon or a way to lead the nation once again to independence, this time energy independence.
"Five percent on each side are passionate," and the remaining 90 percent are unsure, Larry Rosenberg, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, said at a public information session convened on Saturday by the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative, a state agency.
The project, put forward by Cape Wind Associates of Boston, a private concern, involves 130 turbines to be arranged in a grid occupying 24 square miles of Horseshoe Shoals, in Nantucket Sound.
Each tower, with its turbines and blades, would reach 420 feet above the water.
Karen Adams, who supervises the permitting process for the corps of engineers, said it would be at least six or seven months before the corps made a decision on the permit.
Several state and local agencies have yet to weigh in first, Adams said, "and they all have to say yes" for the permit to be approved.
Although the session on Tuesday was the last public hearing, the public comment period has been extended through Feb 24.
Advocates said the turbine array would ultimately produce about three fourths of the electricity now used on Cape Cod, Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, reducing the region's reliance on fossil fuels.
That, in turn, would reduce the risk of global warming, the nation's dependence on imported oil, pollution and pollution related diseases like asthma, they said.
Others said they liked the idea of a wind farm because it would bring jobs to the region, the towers would attract fish and the wind farm might become a tourist attraction.
Opponents say that the project might be a good idea, but that Nantucket Sound is the wrong place for it.
They note that the installation would be the first of its kind in the nation and say that it relies on unproved technology that has run into trouble elsewhere.
In particular, they criticized the corps draft environmental impact study for the proposal.
As is routine, it was paid for by the project applicant, Cape Wind, an arrangement that opponents said tainted its generally upbeat assessment.
Some opponents, including Sen Edward M. Kennedy, whose family compound in Hyannisport would have a view of the towers, said no projects should be approved in Horseshoe Shoals, or other federal waters, until the nation had a more coherent policy for dealing with offshore lands generally.
Two recent reports, one by the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and the other by the Pew Oceans Commission, made similar recommendations, and last month the White House announced that it would pursue the idea.
Greg Watson, a vice president at the technology collaborative, said his group had not taken a stand on the proposal, even though much of its mission involved the encouragement of renewable energy like wind.
The collaborative organized the session on Saturday "as a neutral broker," Watson said, because it was important that the public have confidence that the project, if it went goes forward, was being done right.
Otherwise he said, "it will set back the cause of renewable energy."
Banking giant Goldman Sachs said Monday it will buy Zilkha Renewable Energy, a Houston firm with about a half dozen wind energy projects operating or under development.
The deal will add even more power generating assets to the bank's existing portfolio and put a deeper set of pockets behind wind projects in California, Illinois, Kansas, New York and other states.
Terms were not released.
Wind power accounts for less than 1 percent of all electricity generated in the United States, but new wind turbine installation has grown by 24 percent a year since 2000, according to the American Wind Energy Association.
And 2000 megawatts of wind farms are expected to be installed this year, a 30 percent increase over existing capacity.
One megawatt is enough power to light about 300 homes.
"Goldman Sachs believes that wind and other renewable forms of energy will become an increasingly important part of the world's energy mix, and we aspire to play a leading role in this high growth industry" said Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Henry Paulson Jr. in a statement.
Goldman Sachs has major holdings in energy development, energy finance, power marketing and commodities trading.
The company has more than 30 gas and coal fired power plants acquired through deals with National Energy Gas & Transmission, El Paso Corp., and Congentrix, and has interests in wind farms in Oregon, Wyoming and near Palm Springs, Calif. Zilkha has interests in two projects currently generating power the 75 megawatt Blue Canyon Wind Farm in Okla., and the 24 megawatt Tierras Morenas wind farm in Costa Rica and many other projects in various stages of development.
The two closest to completion are the 200 megawatt Flat Rock project in New York and a 150 megawatt second phase of the Blue Canyon project.
Zilkha Renewable co owners Selim Zilkha and his son Michael Zilkha will maintain a financial interest in the company, while Michael will continue to serve on the board.
The business will continue to be based in Houston with the same management team.
For many years the wind power business has been the beneficiary of an $18 per megawatt hour federal tax credit that has been allowed to expire three times in the last six years, notes Michael Swisher, executive director of the American Wind Energy Association.
The credit is to expire again at the end of this year, and the industry group is calling for the credit to be extended for at least five years.
"The 'on again, off again' nature of the tax credit is more a function of the political process," said Michael Skelly, vice president of development for Zilkha.
"Our view is that there will continue to be support at the popular level and within Congress for wind energy."
The tax credits certainly help the wind energy industry look more attractive to investors, but as prices for power plant fuels continue to rise and the wind turbines become more efficient, the industry becomes more competitive on its own terms.
Selim Zilkha, 77, and Michael Zilkha, 50, are well known in Houston for their ties to the energy industry and for a number of high profile philanthropic efforts.
The elder Zilkha was at one time the largest single shareholder of El Paso Corp.
In 2003, he helped fund an unsuccessful bid to replace the company's board of directors.
He has since sold his shares in the company.
Four new windmill towers and turbines rising from the crown of John Paul Jones Hill will begin powering the U.S. Navy base here next month, saving $1.5 million in annual oil imports, reducing pollution and showing energy starved communist neighbors what they are missing.
The wind generation project that will provide 25 percent to 30 percent of the base's energy needs is a rare embrace of renewable resources for the U.S. military, which can seldom justify the high start up costs or efficiently extend new technologies to the small, scattered communities they serve.
At Guantanamo, where the population has grown fourfold since the base began housing hundreds of suspected enemy combatants captured mostly in Afghanistan, favorable winds and Pentagon mandated energy independence have converged to allow the base to boast the largest stand alone hybrid wind and diesel power system in the world, according to its developers.
Two of the four windmills, each capable of generating 950 kilowatts of electricity, are operational, and the other two will be online by the end of the month, said the Naval Facilities Engineering Command's Mark Leighton, who is overseeing the project.
Augmenting the wind power are two new diesel generators that operate more efficiently and cleanly than the Cold War era units they are replacing, which will boost annual fuel savings to $2.3 million once all the new technology is activated in the next few weeks, Leighton said.
The equipment also will cut carbon dioxide output at these pristine southern shores by 13 million pounds a year.
Though the wind project boasts economic and environmental advances, those behind it concede there is little likelihood of expansion, here or at other military bases.
Guantanamo is unique in its need to remain separate from its communist ruled host and neighbor, and the narrow hilltop where the four stanchions are planted cannot accommodate more.
The pillars standing 185 feet above the hilltop are embedded 35 feet into the ground, each tethered below the surface with 22 "soil nails."
Other high land on the windward side of the base divided by Guantanamo Bay might be suitable, but the cost would be prohibitive compared with the benefit, Leighton said.
Similar wind parks have been erected at two other military installations, said Beverly Wade, project facilitator for a Navy program that invites private contractors to invest in more efficient energy development in return for the project's savings.
She said other renewable energy projects on military bases included solar heated swimming pools at the Norfolk Naval Station and ground source heat pumps at Oceania Naval Air Station, both in Virginia.
"The problem with renewables in the past has been that it's more expensive up front and not necessarily tried and true technology," Wade said.
"Now it's turning out that with the cost of (fossil fuel) energy, renewable prices aren't looking so bad."
The Guantanamo contractor, Noresco of Connecticut, invested $20 million in the windmills and new diesel generators.
The company is entitled to the projects' savings for 14 years, which Leighton estimated at $41 million.
The windmills have life spans of at least 20 years, meaning the Navy will enjoy the savings for several years beyond the contractor's repayment term.
Guantanamo has been self sustaining in utilities for 40 years, able to produce its own water and electricity to remain independent of the Cuban government, said the base public works officer, Cmdr. Jeffrey Johnston.
After Cuban leader Fidel Castro threatened to cut off water to the base in 1964, a desalination plant was built, providing an independent source but boosting electricity demands that until now had been met by diesel generators.
The power is mostly needed to produce water, Johnston said, and Guantanamo's water needs have risen with the base's population, which went from 2500 three years ago to nearly 10000 as the main detention facility for terrorism suspects.
"The water needs for the base have been very complicated because we were small, then large, then small again, now large again," Johnston said of the Guantanamo operation, which has shrunk and swollen with the times, including when it housed waves of intercepted refugees from Haiti and Cuba a decade ago.
"I don't know enough about the future of this base to invest too much more" in energy or water production, Johnston said.
"We are but a flotilla of Haitians away from being a base of 30000 people.
I could draw realistic scenarios that have this base at three times its needs now or one third."
While the wind turbines replace diesel power produced by plants that consume $24 in fuel a minute, their contribution to the base electrical grid can't be efficiently increased beyond the four units.
Unlike diesel powered plants that can be operated as needed, wind is variable and unpredictable, Johnston said.
The good news, he added, is that peak wind times on the base tend to coincide with peak consumption hours of late afternoon and early evening.
The windmills will also help the base overcome a chronic problem of power outages.
Because the base network of diesel generators lacks the backup power supplies that a private utility company would have at its disposal, breakdowns, though usually short in duration, often put the lights out across the base until the problem can be fixed.
Johnston and the base commander, Capt. Leslie J. McCoy, noted that Cuban military officials with whom they met periodically had been keenly interested in the wind project, which is now$the most visible feature of the base from any direction.
"The Cubans are very intrigued by the wind generators, but I see no potential for sharing the technology at this time," McCoy said, alluding to the absence of diplomatic relations with Havana and a trade embargo that has been in place since shortly after Castro came to power in 1959.
Cuba has suffered widespread and protracted electricity outages in recent years as the price of oil has driven up production costs.
The country has invested little in developing alternative energy resources.
Whether the Navy and its neighbor might collaborate in wind power production if more amicable relations are achieved is "difficult to predict," the base commander said.
A California wind energy company is eyeing Colorado and Nevada as locations to build the nation's largest wind turbines.
Clipper Windpower Inc. said the two states are finalists in the company's plan to build a plant that would produce a new line of wind generators soaring 435 feet into the air.
The manufacturing and assembly plant initially would employ 75 workers and ultimately could grow to as many as 550 employees, earning annual salaries averaging $42000, Clipper Windpower chief executive Jim Dehlsen said.
Clipper plans to unveil a prototype of the new turbine minus its 300 foot diameter rotor in Denver in May at Windpower 2005, the annual conference and exhibition of the American Wind Energy Association.
Clipper's new turbines will generate a maximum of 2.5 megawatts, making them two thirds more powerful than the 1.5 megawatt units made by GE Wind Energy that are used at the Lamar wind farm.
One megawatt of continuous electricity serves about 650 homes.
Because the wind blows sporadically, one megawatt of wind capacity serves about 240 to 300 average homes.
Industry analysts said Clipper's large turbine could bring significant improvements in the economics of wind energy.
"Larger turbines make a tremendous difference in the cost competitiveness of wind power" compared with coal and natural gas, said Gary Schmitz of the Golden, Colo. based National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
While larger turbines produce far more power than smaller units, their ground "footprints" the amount of surface area they occupy are only slightly larger.
For example, a wind farm under development by Clipper in Maryland will produce 100 megawatts using the company's new turbines, compared with 70 megawatts if smaller turbines were used on the same amount of acreage.
In addition, the rotors of the larger turbines are higher in the air, causing fewer bird and bat deaths from collisions with blades.
While wind power is widely embraced for its environmental benefits, some critics dislike the noise and visual impact of wind farms containing hundreds of turbines.
The proposed "Cape Wind" project with 130 turbines in offshore waters south of Cape Cod, Mass., has been controversial because of complaints that it would interfere with pristine ocean views.
Clipper Windpower's plan is to build three manufacturing plants in the United States, one each in the West, Midwest and East.
That will help the company reduce transportation costs by placing factories closer to wind farms.
Privately owned Clipper was founded in 2001 by Dehlsen, a wind energy pioneer.
The Carpinteria, Calif. based company developed the $55 million, 44 megawatt Flying Cloud wind farm in Iowa, and did preliminary development work on another Iowa wind project that is one of the nation's largest.
Dehlsen's former company, Zond, developed the 1.5 megawatt turbine that has become the industry standard.
Zond was acquired by Enron in 2000, and after Enron's implosion the company's wind business was picked up by GE Wind.
Capitalizing on the fast developing wind power market, GE has become one of the world's major turbine manufacturers.
After the federal production tax credit on wind energy recently was renewed, inducing a surge of new wind farm proposals, GE landed $1.3 billion in new orders for turbines.
Dehlsen now finds himself in the ironic position of competing against the popular turbine he helped create.
Although he hasn't announced pricing for the 2.5 megawatt turbine, he expects its cost per megawatt will be slightly less than that of GE's 1.5 megawatt unit.
The GE turbines sell for $1.3 million to $1.6 million each, Dehlsen said.
That indicates that Clipper's larger turbine could be priced at slightly less than $2.5 million.
Dehlsen said the Clipper machines will use sophisticated components that will make the turbines more efficient than others on the market.
When the 2.5 megawatt turbine is rolled out this year, Clipper's revenues gradually will shift from wind project development fees to sales of the turbine.
Clipper expects to make a decision on the location of its western manufacturing facility by the end of this month, Dehlsen said.
The company's big turbine is attracting plenty of attention in the industry, said Tom Gray, executive vice president of the Washington based American Wind Energy Association.
With the dollar weak against foreign currencies, American wind farm developers increasingly are looking to domestic turbine makers instead of European giants such as Vestas and Siemens.
"It seems likely that (the Clipper turbine) will improve the economics of wind energy," Gray said.
"Any time a new turbine of that size from a new manufacturer comes to market, that's a significant event."
The Irish authorities on Wednesday ruled out a proposal for a wind farm overlooking one of Ireland's oldest religious sites after objections from pilgrims.
The Hibernian Wind Power company wanted to build 12 wind turbines on a site overlooking St Patrick's Purgatory on Station Island in Lough Derg, the country's most arduous pilgrimage venue.
Supporters of the sanctuary, the Friends of Lough Derg, said the development would overlook the ancient monument and traditional pilgrimage site and "interfere with its tranquillity both audibly and visibly".
Planning Board inspector Stephen O'Sullivan concluded the wind farm and its 65 metre (200 foot) high turbines would "seriously injure the visual setting of Lough Derg in a manner which diminished its cultural heritage value".
The island in the Donegal lake near the border with British ruled Northern Ireland is amongst the oldest centres of Christian pilgrimage in the world, supposedly dating back to the 6th century.
A regime of medieval mortification and cleansing for barefoot pilgrims is still practised today.
It involves three days of fasting, reciting mantra type prayers while walking on the sharp stones of the island's 'penitential beds' and no sleep for 24 hours.
The Purgatory got its name from a legend that Ireland's patron saint, Patrick, endured the temptation of the devil in a cave on the island.
Pilgrims have ranged from King Harold of England in 1050 to Ireland's President Mary McAleese.
Last year an estimated 30000 people from 27 countries made the pilgrimage.
Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming wen agreed Tuesday in principle to a wind energy investment project proposed by the Germany based Infra Vest Group, which plans to set up 97 wind turbines in coastal areas of the southern Taiwan county.
Chen gave the nod to the investment plan with conditions attached after hearing a briefing by Infra Vest officials.
The magistrate stipulated that the group must cooperate unconditionally in future infrastructure construction and must fully communicate with local residents and environmentalists.
He also demanded that the group come up with compensation and feed back measures before moving into further negotiations.
According to Infra Vest officials, the group has decided to invest NT$16 billion (US$500 million) in setting up 97 wind turbines in Chiayi's coastal areas after carrying out various in depth inspections of the area.
Stressing that the Tungshih and Putai areas are extremely rich in wind power and resources, they said the group is planning to install six turbines there in the initial stage.
Each will have the capacity of between 12 million and 18 million watts, generating 51 million kilowatt hours per year, they explained.
They said the plan will cause no pollution, low noise, and no exhaust gas or waste water, and pointed out that electricity generated by wind energy is increasing at a fast pace of between 15 percent and 30 percent every year in advanced countries such as Germany and Denmark.
In these strictly eco friendly nations, wind energy has largely replaced traditional coal, gas, nuclear power or other fossil fuel for power generation, they said, adding that the group has made similar investment plans in Brazil, France, mainland China, Spain, Sweden and Turkey.
Investment in wind energy should bring fourth profit.
This is necessary for a sustainable development of renewable energies, a distinct goal of many governments, Infra Vest said at its Website.
It is our strong belief that this goal can only be achieved by proper plans and commercially viable projects that can also create local economic benefits, it said, calling wind energy clean, competitive and inexhaustible that will heed public concerns over environmental protection and conservation.
Infra Vest has already held a seminar in Putai township to explained the investment plan to local residents.
It has gained security confirmations from the Ministry of National Defense and the Civil Aeronautics Administration, as well as initial land use approval from the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau.
At present, the state run Taiwan Power Company maintains four wind power turbines in offshore Penghu County and is considering adding another four due to its better than expected capacity, in line with the Kyoto Pact that will become effective this summer in several parts of the world to cut emissions of greenhouse gas.
An audacious solo flight around the world the first without stops or refueling ended Thursday afternoon where it began as the GlobalFlyer touched down safely, its 13 fuel tanks nearly empty.
The plane, piloted by Steve Fossett, a 60 year old investment executive and avid sailor, glider pilot and balloonist, covered about 23000 miles on a zigzag course across the Atlantic, Africa, Asia and the Pacific to ride the tailwinds, which sometimes blew at 150 mph.
It touched down shortly before 2 p.m. local time on Thursday at a former Air Force base in Salina, Kan., 67 hours after it took off.
The voyage, apparently the longest solo airplane flight in distance and time, was also a test of human endurance.
Fossett, who emerged from his cramped cockpit through a small access hatch to the cheers of spectators and his ground crew, said he did not sleep at all for the first 24 hours, had only a few catnaps for the rest of the trip, and subsisted on a dozen diet milkshakes.
Fossett, who became the first to fly around the world solo in a balloon on his sixth attempt in 2002, said on the runway in Salina that this solo flight was "a major ambition."
Richard Branson, the flamboyant Virgin Atlantic airline magnate who bankrolled the project for an undisclosed sum, waved a giant checkered flag, and later doused Fossett in champagne.
Before the trip Fossett called the mission "highly interesting from a technical standpoint."
On landing, he said, "I had the good fortune of getting the right people associated with it."
The plane consisted of a tiny fuselage flanked by twin booms to hold the fuel, each with its own tail.
A gliderlike wing, as long as the wing on a Boeing 737, but lacking the flaps and slats that help pilots control most long distance planes, connected the cabin and the booms.
The jet engine was attached to the top.
The flight was a test of how fuel efficient a plane could be and how much fuel it could carry.
The 18100 pounds of fuel on takeoff Monday evening made up 82 percent of the plane's weight.
The builders nicknamed the plane the "flying fuel tank."
One consideration in carrying so much fuel was that on landing, the plane was radically different from the one that took off.
The GlobalFlyer departed to the east weighing as much as a 19 seat commuter plane, and approached from the west weighing less than a medium sized sport utility vehicle, a difference that posed substantial challenges because of changes in its handling characteristics.
Fossett said early in the flight that it handled well, but with only one pilot aboard, much of the flying was done by autopilot.
He made the trip in a cigar shaped cabin in a seat that resembled a recliner.
He could not stand up.
The GlobalFlyer was designed by Burt Rutan and built by Rutan's company, Scaled Composites, of Mojave, Calif.
Exhaustion began to set in as American adventurer Steve Fossett reached the final legs of his epic bid at the first solo, non stop non refueled flight around the world, which he is confident he will complete despite some loss of fuel.
When asked how he felt after his second full day of flying, Fossett late Wednesday told reporters via satellite phone: "It feels like three days."
"I've gotten minimal naps while keeping my eyes on the instruments," he added, explaining that because of the west to east direction he is flying, he "had to do four nights in a two and a half day trip."
The 60 year old millionaire had a stressful night after the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer support team at Mission Control here discovered that he had 2600 pounds (1181 kilograms) less fuel than expected.
The 3350 pound (1522 kilo) single engine aircraft lifted off from here with 18100 pounds (8210 kilos) of fuel on Monday.
For much of the day there were concerns that Fossett would have to abort the mission and land in Hawaii.
But by 04:00 GMT Thursday, Fossett and his crew determined that he had sufficient fuel to continue onward.
"The jet stream has been extraordinary.
That allowed me to make up some time.
In addition I've practiced fuel conservation."
Fossett said.
"I have every hope of making it to Salina."
Fossett said he was happy to hear that he had already broken one record: the longest non stop distance traveled by a jet airplane.
He sounded personally touched to hear about the vast public interest his journey had generated.
On launch, the mission's Web site, www.virginatlanticglobalflyer.com, received 2.8 million hits.
Between 04:00 GMT Wednesday and 04:00 GMT Thursday, the site received 76 million hits.
While the cause of the fuel loss has not been determined, organizers said it was possible that fuel evaporated or escaped or that more fuel than expected was used during takeoff.
The plane had never flown before with full tanks and some fuel may have spilled out through a venting system used to maintain adequate pressure in the tanks, organizers said.
A leak is unlikely, they added, as the fuel loss ceased after the first few hours of flight.
The plane's four main tanks are equipped with sensors, but not the additional tanks in the wings, where it was impossible to detect a possible leak until they began draining into the main boom tanks.
By the time Fossett reached Hawaii the wing tanks had begun to drain and it appeared there were no further fuel losses, said project manager Paul Moore.
Organizers are now hopeful that Fossett will be able to make it back to Salina by Thursday midday (around 18:00 GMT) if tailwinds remain strong.
The plane was equipped at takeoff with 15 percent more fuel than it was expected to use.
It also has a strong glide capacity and could make the last 200 miles (325 kilometers) on an empty tank if necessary.
Moore said that given the current fuel situation, Fossett should be able to land with fuel to spare.
However, Moore cautioned that a number of problems could arise in the coming hours to force Fossett to abort the flight.
"Some things have gone in Steve's favor in the last few hours," he said.
"But Steve and the Global Flyer are close to the limits of their endurance."
An unscheduled landing would not pose a risk, Moore said.
"Although Steve required a huge runway to takeoff, there are a number of airstrips that Steve can safely land on," he said.
At 0930 GMT Thursday, Fossett was flying over the Pacific Ocean, 1151 miles (1852) kilometers southwest of California, at an elevation of 46282 feet (14107 meters) and a speed of 255 miles per hour (410 kilometers per hour).
He had been flying for more than 53 hours.
The three day journey is a severe test of endurance and piloting abilities for Fossett, who has set dozens of world records with jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing.
The attempt is being bankrolled by Virgin Atlantic founder and entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, who has set a number of aviation and sailing records of his own.
The GlobalFlyer was designed by aviation legend Burt Rutan, who recently made headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10 million dollar "X Prize" for sending a privately designed craft into space twice in two weeks.
Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to fly around the world without stopping or refueling in nine days.
Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 hours, and by doing it on his own.
For GlobalFlyer, "Mission Accomplished" By DIANE CARROLL The Kansas City Star SALINA.
Kan. Steve Fossett had just endured 67 hours in a cramped cockpit, with only milkshakes for sustenance, not knowing for half the way whether he had enough fuel to get home.
But when he emerged from the cockpit of his GlobalFlyer at 2 p.m., having become the first to fly a plane solo around the world without refueling, one might have thought he was returning from an afternoon jaunt.
The burly 60 year old, dressed in a silvery flight suit, popped out his head, acknowledged the crowd gathered at Salina Municipal Airport with a wave and walked steadily into the arms of his wife, Peggy Fossett.
Then, in a most understated way, he told the crowd: "I'm a really lucky guy.
I got to achieve my ambition."
Fossett seemed to take his latest adventure in stride, but city leaders and aviation authorities called it a very big deal.
"This is a monumental achievement in aviation," said David Hawksett of London, who assesses scientific achievements for Guinness World Records.
In terms of significant firsts, he said, Fossett's feat is on par with the 1969 moon landing and the 1953 climb up Mount Everest.
"This kind of thing makes people sit up and say, 'Wow, look what can be done!"'
More important, Hawksett said, it "inspires kids all over the world."
Clif Berry Jr., who wrote 2002's Milestones of the First Century of Flight , said Fossett's accomplishment was "an incredible feat."
"Just imagine, there you are all alone at 45000 feet, with no chance to refuel.
It's just marvelous," Berry said "I do hope it inspires the young and old to have their own challenges and go after them."
Sylvia Rice, vice president of the Salina Chamber of Commerce, said Fossett's achievement put her city on the map.
It is a significant addition to the city's already rich aviation history, she said.
"Everyone was so excited to see that plane come in," Rice said.
"You could feel the adrenaline and emotion, and people were crying, and it was wonderful."
Mission control directors estimated the crowd in the thousands.
People were strung out in groups along the 2.5 mile runway.
Shortly before the 1:47 p.m. touchdown, the mission's project director told media gathered on the south side of the runway that Fossett would not do a flyover because turbulence had made the plane difficult to handle.
"The aircraft is so light now that he is not going to take the risk," director Paul Moore said.
"The main thing is that he cruises down safely."
The landing looked perfect.
Jon Karkow, chief engineer for Scaled Composites, the company that designed and built the plane, said Fossett did an excellent job of bringing the plane down.
It had about 1100 pounds of fuel left, enough to fly about another 10 hours.
The GlobalFlyer was leaking a little hydraulic fluid, Karkow said, and had a few bugs on it.
Other than that, it appeared to be in perfect shape, he said.
The mission was sponsored by Virgin Atlantic, a British airline founded by Richard Branson.
Branson greeted Fossett on Thursday with a hug and a bottle of champagne, which Branson began spraying on Fossett.
Fossett grabbed the bottle, sprayed his friend back and took a chug.
Fossett holds world records in five sports, including ballooning and sailing.
Branson has been his partner in some of them.
In an interview with reporters near the GlobalFlyer, Fossett said that the fuel situation had concerned him, that but he had run into similar problems before.
He said he liked "things that are difficult to do" and loved technology projects.
"I would do these things if no one were paying attention," he said.
When asked what kind of contribution his feat had made to mankind, he said he wasn't sure it had made any.
"I know Richard Branson doesn't agree with me.
He thinks there's an important technological contribution in this," Fossett said.
"I think it's more in the lifestyle itself.
I like going out and doing things that are interesting to me, and I think other people should do what is interesting to them."
The Global Flyer left Salina at 6:47 p.m. Monday.
It weighed 4000 pounds and carried 18100 pounds of fuel.
On Wednesday morning, Mission Control directors announced that 2600 pounds of fuel had mysteriously disappeared.
They said the fuel shortage put the world record in jeopardy.
By Wednesday evening, however, the directors were more optimistic.
And, as it turned out, the GlobalFlyer appears to have had fuel to spare.
When asked Thursday morning whether the fuel situation had been overplayed to gain publicity, Branson said the concern was real.
"Incredibly, the thing is, in life truth is often stranger than fiction," he said.
NASA astronaut Ken Cockrell of Houston, whose last space mission was in 2002, was intrigued enough by the mission to spend the week in Salina.
He was enthusiastic about it to the end.
"In every human heart there is a desire to explore," Cockrell said, as he waited on the runway Thursday for Fossett to touch down.
"Some people like to explore things in a very small niche of their environment.
Others, like Steve, want to explore things no one else has ever done."

American adventurer Steve Fossett said Wednesday he may be forced to abort his mission to circle the globe without stopping after experiencing significant fuel loss on takeoff.
Fossett called the previously undetected loss of an extra 2600 pounds (1181 kilograms) of fuel "a huge setback."
"I don't have a very high level of confidence at this point," Fossett told reporters from his plane, adding: "I'm going to do the best I can."
Fossett said he would have to maintain a tailwind speed of 67 miles (180 kilometers) per hour, the average up to now, to finish his attempt.
Earlier Wednesday, Fossett passed the halfway point in his effort to make the first solo, non stop flight around the world without refueling and with almost no sleep.
Fossett took off from this Midwestern US state on Monday and was to return here Thursday morning after spending between 60 and 80 hours in the air.
The 3350 pound (1522 kilo) single engine aircraft was to burn nearly 19000 pounds (8636 kilos) of fuel.
The attempt is being bankrolled by Virgin Atlantic founder and entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, who has set a number of aviation and sailing records of his own.
American adventurer Steve Fossett reached the half way point while flying over India, in his attempt to make the first solo, non stop flight around the world without refueling and with very little sleep.
"Unless he's talking in his sleep he's pretty cogent," joked project manager Paul Moore, who added that the record breaking millionaire has gotten through numerous similar challenges due to "his level headedness, stamina and self reliance."
At 0705 GMT, Fossett had reached the half way point in his solo voyage, while flying at 46801 feet (14265 meters) after being aloft more than 30 hours.
The Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer was over Myanmar at speeds of around 300 knots (345 miles per hour/555 kilometers per hour).
Should everything continue to go as planned, Fossett is expected to return to Salina on Thursday morning after spending between 60 and 80 hours in the air.
While Fossett is relying on an autopilot throughout the journey, he cannot safely ignore the complex demands of the experimental aircraft for much more than 10 or 20 minutes at a time, organizers said.
As a result, he can only take power naps for the rest of the three day journey.
On Tuesday, in a series of radio hook ups with reporters at Mission Control here, Fossett said he had a "good chance" of completing the record breaking flight.
"I have picked up a 100 mile per hour (160 kilometers) jet stream just behind me and I am covering territory fast, which is very encouraging," he said.
"It's interesting to watch things go by and I am looking forward to another good day tomorrow."
The most serious problem was a temporary failure of the Global Positioning System, Fossett's satellite navigation aid.
"This was my sole source of navigation, so this was very serious," he said, adding that the GPS had not functioned for about half of his flight over Canada.
"I believe it was an antenna problem," he said.
He cautioned that other problems could arise and that there was still a long way to go.
"There may be new things that come up so there's no real basis for confidence," he said, "but I'm happy with the situation."
Moore said cabin pressure remained good even after Fossett climbed to 49500 feet (15090 meters) and the temperature in the cramped cockpit was 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius).
"His feet are a bit chilly," said Moore.
Fossett nonetheless reported being "comfortable enough" in the 7.7 foot (2.3 meter) long cockpit.
"I have got elbow room, I can get to everything, I'm not complaining," he said.
"It is a long trip especially the nights.
I feel a little bit tired, but I have been through this before and I am going to be okay."
The three day journey will test the endurance and piloting abilities of Fossett, a 60 year old millionaire who has set dozens of world records with jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing.
British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson who has set a number of aviation and sailing records of his own is funding the project through his company Virgin Atlantic Airways.
Interest in the record setting attempt has drawn journalists from all over the world to Salinas, and the mission's website, virginatlanticglobalflyer.com, has drawn more than eight million hits the past 24 hours.
The GlobalFlyer was designed by aviation legend Burt Rutan, who recently made headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10 million dollar "X Prize" for sending a privately designed craft into space twice in two weeks.
Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to set a nine day record for a non stop, non refueled flight around the world.
Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 hours, and by doing it on his own.
At takeoff, the 3350 pound (1522 kilogram) single engine aircraft was carrying nearly 19000 pounds (8636 kilograms) of fuel in 13 tanks for the 23000 mile (37260 kilometer) journey at altitudes as high as 52000 feet (15850 meters).
American adventurer Steve Fossett was remarkably alert and chipper as he soared over India Wednesday, on the second sleepless day of his attempt to make the first solo, non stop flight around the world without refueling, organizers said.
"Unless he's talking in his sleep he's pretty cogent," joked project manager Paul Moore, who added that the record breaking millionaire has gotten through numerous similar challenges due to "his level headedness, stamina and self reliance."
At 05:30 GMT, Fossett was at 46750 feet (14250 meters) after being aloft for nearly 29 hours.
The Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer was over northwestern India heading towards Calcutta at speeds of around 300 knots (345 miles per hour/555 kilometers per hour).

By 04:00 GMT there was just 9600 pounds (43540 kilograms) of fuel remaining.
Madcap aviator Steve Fossett glided his GlobalFlyer to a picture perfect landing here Thursday 67 hours after taking off, becoming the first pilot to circle the globe nonstop, alone and without refueling.
Fossett stayed awake by drinking a dozen chocolate protein milkshakes as he broke what his supporters consider the last great aviation feat.
His mission of some 23000 miles set several world records, registering as the fastest nonstop flight around the world.
"That's something I've wanted to do for some time," Fossett, 60, said, shortly after squeezing out of the tiny cockpit before a raucous crowd of about 5000.
"I've achieved my ambition."
After landing, Fossett exchanged high fives with British billionaire Richard Branson, a long time friend who financed the project and commissioned legendary aircraft designer Burt Rutan to build the catamaran shaped plane.
It was powered by a single jet engine.
"Can you walk?"
Branson asked Fossett before spraying him with champagne.
The flight marked the second major privately funded aerospace event since the fall with a Rutan design.
In October Rutan's SpaceShipOne rocket soared into the edge of space on a suborbital flight and back with a single pilot, claiming a $10 million prize.
By contrast, Fossett's round the world solo flight was done for the technological and human endurance challenge, with no prize money involved.
In recent decades most aviation records have been set by commercial aircraft or government funded space missions.
Aviation enthusiasts applauded Fossett's exploit as a reminder of the early days of flight when adventurous pilots frequently broke records, became instant celebrities and drew front page newspaper headlines and massive crowds.
In Fossett's case, much of the town of Salina showed up at the airport to welcome him, including a high school marching band and several people holding up signs: "Go Go GlobalFlyer!"
"It's the biggest thing that ever happened in our lives," said Amber Windholz, a 17 year old baton twirler for the band.
The first plane to circumnavigate the globe nonstop and without refueling was another designed by Rutan, the Voyager in 1986.
But that aircraft was powered by two propeller engines and flown by two pilots taking turns.
And it took nine days to fly around the world.
Fossett began his journey Monday at 6:47 p.m. CST when the Star Trek lookalike craft, with a 114 foot wingspan took off from the Salina Municipal Airport with 18000 pounds of fuel or about 82 percent of the aircraft's weight.
Salina was chosen mainly because its runway is one of the longest in the Midwest, and because it allowed Fossett to spend the last segment of his mission over land.
To break the world record,Fossett had to fly the craft more than 22858 miles, or the same circumference as the Tropic of Cancer, and pass a dozen waypoints.
During the flight, Fossett kept to drinking protein milkshakes, which minimized bowel movements while providing nutrition.
He also took half a dozen catnaps of about one to three minutes.
A millionaire and former options trader in Chicago, Fossett has broken 60 aviation records, competed in triathlons and the 1100 mile Iditarod sled dog race in Alaska.
In 2002 he became the first pilot to make a solo, nonstop hot air balloon around the world in 13 days and 8 hours .
Beside the fastest and the longest records Fossett has broken, the Tennessee native also set the world record for the slowest swim across the English Channel, completing the 21 mile ocean swim in 22 hours.
"Steve is a different animal than most of us," Rutan said.
At 1:48 p.m. CST, Fossett landed the GlobalFlyer on the same runway where he took off 67 hours, 2 minutes and 38 seconds earlier.
The gas tank caps and the cockpit door still had the same adhesive tape that been applied before the flight as a way a way to verify there were no surreptitious refueling stops.
The trip wasn't without tense moments.
Problems with some equipment jeopardized the mission at the onset and toward the end.
In the early part of the flight, Fossett had to rely on directions from mission control because of problems with the aircraft's global positioning system, which provides near precise geographic location of the aircraft.
Then toward the end, as he flew past Japan and began the trek across the Pacific, gauges showed that the airplane was low on fuel.
Fossett decided to continue after the airplane picked up strong tailwinds of up to 160 miles per hour.
"We got beautiful tailwinds over the Pacific," said Rutan.
"If we didn't have the tailwinds, we would not have made it."
Fossett looked surprisingly refreshed after he landed.
But one of his first wishes, he said, was to be able to "sleep for a full day."
Hart reported from Kansas, Pae from Los Angeles.
American adventurer Steve Fossett has decided to continue his historic bid for the first solo non refueled flight around the world despite loss of fuel, project managers announced here late Wednesday.
"Let's go for it," Fossett told Mission Control via satellite radio as his plane cruised north of Hawaii.
Project manager Paul Moore told reporters that the goal of the first solo non stop, non refueled circumnavigation of the globe was "within Steve's grasp," despite the fact that the plane had leaked fuel.
The mission was called into question earlier Wednesday, when it was discovered the plane had 2600 pounds (1181 kilograms) less fuel than expected.
While the cause of the loss has not been determined, organizers said it was possible that the fuel evaporated or escaped.
More fuel than expected may have been used during takeoff.
The plane had never before been flown with full tanks and some fuel may have spilled out through a venting system used to maintain adequate pressure in the tanks, organizers said.
A leak is unlikely as the fuel loss ceased after the first few hours of flight.
Organizers are hopeful that Fossett will be able to make it back to Salina on Thursday if tailwinds remain strong.
American adventurer Steve Fossett, seeking to make the first solo flight around the globe without refueling, is running low on fuel but will fly at least as far as Hawaii before deciding whether to continue, officials said Wednesday.
"I'm pleased to say that based on the information provided to him by the team here at Mission Control, Steve has decided that he will fly at least as far as Hawaii," Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer project manager Paul Moore told reporters.
"He will then make a further decision at that stage as to whether he feels comfortable and confident to fly beyond Hawaii towards the west coast of the US," he added.
Fossett is running low on fuel and Mission Control had been considering whether to abort the flight in Hawaii or have the plane turn back towards Japan.
At 2000 GMT on Wednesday, Fossett was east of Japan flying over the Pacific towards Hawaii.
He took off from an airport here on Monday and is hoping to touch down in Salina on Thursday, becoming the first person ever to make a solo non stop, non refueled flight around the world.
Millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett's solo flight around the world flight encountered its first major hurdle Wednesday with the discovery of a serious fuel shortage aboard his Global Flyer that threatened to cut short the journey.
As Fossett was flying over mainland China, mission control officials in Salina, Kan. reported their conclusion that he had a fuel shortage 2600 pounds, or 450 gallons less than they had counted on.
The shortage was blamed on a discrepancy between gauges monitoring the rate of fuel consumption and fuel tank sensors measuring the remaining fuel.
"This is a huge setback to think we might not have enough fuel for the remainder of the flight," Fossett said.
Despite the bad news, Fossett decided to press on to Hawaii and re evaluate his fuel supply when he reached the islands, sometime around 10 p.m. EST Wednesday.
If he continues, he expected to land at Salina Municipal Airport around midday today.
"The whole mission is jeopardized, but we will just have to take it one step at a time," Fossett said.
Fossett, who left Monday night on the solo flight, was taking catnaps Wednesday to stay alert.
He planned to pump fuel from the airplane's dozen or so wing tanks to two central fuel booms to get a final, accurate measurement of exactly how much fuel remained.
"I don't have a very high level of confidence at this point," he conceded.
"The fuel that remains in the wings still has to be transferred to the main tanks, and if there is some kind of blockage, that could boil the whole clam."
He and mission control officials said they would decide Wednesday night whether to press on to the west coast of the United States, seven hours of flying time away, to return to Fossett's starting point in Salina.
"Steve and all of us in mission control are fairly optimistic, but there is still a long, long way to go," said mission director Paul Moore.
As Fossett started across the Pacific, his single engine jet was burning approximately 30 gallons of jet fuel an hour, with enough fuel estimated on board for another 25 hours or so of flying.
With the aid of a 110 mile per hour tail wind and a ground speed of nearly 400 miles per hour, that would be more than enough to get him all the way to Kansas.
But flight officials said they expected the tail winds to subside east of Hawaii, and that could make the difference.
Once the fuel is exhausted, the Global Flyer would be light enough to allow Fossett to glide the last 200 miles of his journey.
"Right now he has insufficient fuel to make it home without a tail wind," Moore reported.
"Steve is quite literally at the mercy of the winds."
Fully loaded at takeoff, his single engine jet carried 18100 pounds of fuel, so the missing fuel amounted to nearly 15 percent of the plane's total.
Because the Global Flyer's full load of fuel included about a 15 percent margin, mission control officials said the chances of completing his flight were too close to call.
Mission control officials said the first indication of a fuel problem came within hours of takeoff.
"We saw it early in the flight, but we really didn't want to admit that the discrepancy was real," engineering director Jon Karkow acknowledged Wednesday.
"It now looks like that within the first three and a half hours of flights, 2600 pounds of fuel simply disappeared."
Mission engineers still aren't sure what happened, but they said fuel apparently vented unexpectedly from the craft's four wing tanks during the aircraft's initial climb to cruising altitude.
Until the start of its global flight, the plane which carries six times its own weight in fuel had never taken off with a full load, a maneuver so risky that Fossett didn't want to try it until he was ready to circle the globe.

American adventurer Steve Fossett flew over Africa on Tuesday after battling a series of equipment problems in the early stages of his bid to make the first solo non stop flight around the world without refueling.
Fossett, who took off from here in the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer on Monday for a flight expected to last between 60 and 80 hours, said he had to deal with a number of "dramas," particularly during takeoff, but the flight was going well overall.
At 1607 GMT, Fossett was at approximately 45000 feet (13000 meters) and had been in the air for 15 hours and 20 minutes.
The GlobalFlyer was over Morocco heading east at a speed of around 340 knots (390 miles per hour/630 kilometers per hour) "At this time everything is going very well," Fossett said in a radio hook up with reporters at Mission Control in Salina.
"I'm very happy with the situation and I think we've got a good chance."
He said the takeoff of the GlobalFlyer, which is essentially a flying gas tank 83 percent of the total weight is fuel had been difficult.
"It had a lot of dramas in the launch, dramas with equipment failures that had to be solved," Fossett said.
"The plane was much slower than I expected but fortunately the plane picked up speed and I didn't have to abort," he said.
Among the problems was a temporary failure of the Global Positioning System, or GPS, Fossett's primary navigation aid.
"This was my sole source of navigation so this was very serious," he said, adding that the GPS had not functioned for about half of his flight over Canada.
"I believe it was an antenna problem," Fossett said.
He cautioned that other problems could arise during the flight and there was still a long way to go.
"There may be new things that come up so there's no real basis for confidence," he said, "but I'm happy with the situation."
Fossett said he had consumed three chocolate milkshakes since the flight began.
"It's not exactly my favorite diet but it will certainly serve the purpose for this flight."
At Mission Control, flight controllers were carefully monitoring fuel consumption.
"One of the critical factors we are monitoring is the amount of fuel he has left," said project manager Paul Moore.
"He's eaten quite substantially into his fuel (so far) but that's as we expected."
Moore said the GPS problem had been potentially very serious.
"This could have been a showstopper," he said.
"This was really a big worry as we are unable to fly without GPS especially when were out of radio range.
"Steve was essentially flying blind," Moore said.
"Happily, after a couple of hours of malfunction the GPS system did reengage."
The three day journey will test the endurance and piloting abilities of Fossett, a 60 year old millionaire who has set dozens of world records and world firsts with jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing.
At takeoff, the 3350 pound (1522 kilogram) single engine aircraft was carrying nearly 19000 pounds (8636 kilograms) of fuel in 13 tanks for the 23000 mile (37260 kilometer) journey at altitudes as high as 52000 feet (15850 meters).
Virgin Atlantic Airways of Sir Richard Branson is funding the GlobalFlyer and the British entrepreneur is in Salina monitoring the flight.
The GlobalFlyer was designed by aviation legend Burt Rutan, who recently made headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10 million dollar "X Prize" for sending a privately designed craft into space twice in two weeks.
Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to set a record of nine days for a non stop, non refueled flight around the world.
Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 hours, and by doing it on his own.
Steve Fossett is waiting on the wind.
With all preparations complete for a solo, non stop flight around the globe, the only thing standing in the way of the legendary adventurers next attempt to set a world record is an uncooperative jet stream.
"It's never been an exact science," said spokeswoman Anna Burdsall.
"There are two different weather systems we're dealing with the ground weather in Salinas, that's one consideration, and the other is the weather and the jet stream going around the world."
The launch of the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer has been delayed a number of times since it arrived in Salinas, Kansas, on January 7.
The light bodied aircraft relies on prevailing winds, or the jet stream, to help push it along its journey.
But it needs to avoid the jet stream until it reaches its cruising altitude or else it could be damaged by heavy turbulence.
A February 2 launch was cancelled because the jet stream moved too far north, which meant Fossett would lose too much fuel catching up to it to make it the rest of the way around the world.
The February 6 and February 8 launches were cancelled because the jet stream moved too close to Kansas and created a situation of heavy wind and turbulence.
So Fossett and his crew have remained on high alert, waiting for the perfect weather conditions.
The next potential launch date is late next week.
"Everyone within the project team understands how these type of projects work," said Burdsall, who described the mood of the 30 plus people working on the project as one of anticipation.
The project brings together three giants of aviation and adventure.
Fossett has set dozens of world records and world firsts with jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing.
The American millionaire became famous in the mid 1990s when he made a number of attempts with British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson to fly around the globe in a hot air balloon.
Branson, whose company Virgin Atlantic Airways is funding the GlobalFlyer, is acting as the reserve pilot.
The British businessman has also set a number of sailing and aviation records in his own right while promoting the Virgin brand.
He will monitor Fossett's progress from mission control in Salinas.
The GlobalFlyer was designed by Burt Rutan, who recently made headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10 million dollar "X Prize" for sending a privately designed craft into space twice in two weeks.
Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to set a record of nine days for a non stop, non refueled flight around the world.
Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 hours, and by doing it on his own.
"The first solo non stop is a grand endeavour," Fossett said in an interview on the GlobalFlyer Web site.
"This will require all of my abilities as a pilot, it will test my endurance, and it will demonstrate the finest in lightweight aircraft construction and improvements in jet engine fuel efficiency that have never before been achieved."
The 3350 pound (1522 kilogram) single engine aircraft will carry nearly 19000 pounds (8636 kilograms) of fuel in 13 tanks for the 23000 mile (37260 kilometer) journey.
Some of the major cities Fossett expects to pass along the way are Chicago, Toronto, London, Paris, Rome, Cairo, Bahrain, Karachi, Calcutta, Shanghai, Tokyo, Honolulu and Los Angeles.
Virgin is looking for people with high powered telescopes to operate as spotters and take pictures and video of the plane as it flies overhead at 45000 feet (13636 meters).
American adventurer Steve Fossett likes to joke that his attempt to fly around the world without stopping or refueling has no "practical" purpose.
But the research that went into developing the super light and aerodynamic aircraft could one day lead to more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly commercial planes, said Sir Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, which is funding the project.
"As an airline, we hope that Virgin Atlantic airplanes will (one day) be made of composite materials and that metal will be thrown away," Branson said at a press conference Monday.
The single engine turbofan aircraft designed by Burt Rutans Scale Composites is constructed with lightweight, composite materials in order to maximize fuel efficiency.
It is so aerodynamically perfect that it needs drag parachutes to land.
While he admits that his taste for adventure and publicity also drove his interest in the GlobalFlyer, Branson said he also hopes that the project will spur further interest in aviation and adventure.
"A lot of benefits to mankind come from projects like this," Branson said.
"Kids around the world can log in and participate in a great adventure and perhaps aspire to something like it in the future."
The aircraft will also allow the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to test a new state of the art communications system that will one day be used on spacecraft.
NASA said that the equipment has the potential to "reduce the cost and infrastructure of the current ground based communications systems" by using satellites to relay tracking and flight data.
The GlobalFlyer is also being used as a platform for research into cosmic radiation.
The experimental aircraft took off from Salina Municipal Airport here on Monday for a flight around the world that is expected to last between 60 and 80 hours.
Fossett crossed the Atlantic and was over Africa on Tuesday.
Millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett has taken off on his attempt to become the first person to complete a solo trip around the world in an airplane without making a single stop.
Fossett, the first person to circle the globe solo in a balloon, launched his GlobalFlyer from the Salina Municipal Airport shortly before 7 p.m. Monday, beginning a 66 hour journey by climbing northeast into a darkening sky.
Hundreds of spectators, braving a bitterly cold wind, gathered along the two mile (three kilometer) runway to watch the takeoff.
Fossett hoped to return to Salina on Thursday morning.
The 23000 mile (37000 kilometer) flight had already been postponed several times because of shifting jet stream patterns or weather at the airport.
"I'm a bit nervous about takeoff," said Fossett, 60, who has logged about 30 hours in the jet powered aircraft.
"I will be the ultimate test pilot.
I have a lot to worry about.
It's a major endeavor."
Financed by Virgin Atlantic founder Sir Richard Branson, it would be the first solo flight around the world without stopping to refuel.
Branson watched the takeoff from the side of the runway with Fossett's wife.
"It was obviously an emotional moment and the most dangerous part of the journey," he said.
"It was an enormous relief when it actually came off the ground."
By late Monday night, Fossett was soaring over Canada.
"He was pretty determined to get away," project manager Paul Moore said at a briefing hours after the takeoff.
Aviation pioneer Wiley Post made the first solo around the world trip in 1933, taking more than seven days and stopping numerous times along the way.
The first nonstop global flight without refueling by a duo was made in 1986 by Jeana Yeager and Dick Rutan, brother of Burt Rutan, designer of the GlobalFlyer.
Besides the nonstop record, Fossett will attempt to break seven other aviation records, including the longest flight by a jet aircraft.
The current record is more than 12000 miles (19300 kilometers), set by a B 52 bomber in 1962.
Mission control director Kevin Stass said Fossett would fly over Chicago, Detroit and Canada before heading across the Atlantic late Monday night.
The route would then take him over Africa, the Middle East, India, China and the Pacific Ocean.
The flight plan was adjusted once more later Monday after Algeria closed a portion of its airspace, mission control director Kevin Stass said.
The change, he said, would slightly reduce the overall length of the flight and save some of the 18000 pounds ( 8100 kilograms) of fuel aboard the single engine jet.
Fossett planned to fly at an average speed of 287.5 mph (462.6 kph) and rely on the jet stream to stretch his fuel.
The GlobalFlyer will have about 15 percent extra fuel to allow for weather conditions or other changes to the flight plan, said Jon Karkow, chief engineer for the flight.
There was a risk the fuel could freeze from flying in the cold at altitudes of 52000 feet (15600 meters) for such a long time.
Fossett will survive on diet milkshakes.
"I just picked a bunch of flavors off the shelf at the store," he said.
Branson planned to follow Fossett in a chase plane for the first day of the flight and on the last leg.
He gave Fossett his wristwatch, complete with emergency beacon device, to wear for the flight.
"We want you and (the watch) back in one piece at the end," Branson quipped.
Fossett became the first to fly a balloon solo around the world in 2002 after nearly dying twice in six attempts to set the record.
He has also tried to break the world gliding altitude record for the past four years in New Zealand but has failed because of poor conditions.
American adventurer Steve Fossett flew over the Middle East on Tuesday after overcoming a navigation equipment problem that threatened to derail his historic bid to make the first non stop flight around the world without refueling.
Fossett, who took off from here in the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer on Monday for a flight expected to last between 60 and 80 hours, said he hae navigation aid.
"This was my sole source of navigation so this was very serious," he said, adding that the GPS had not functioned for about half of his flight over Canada.
"I believe it was an antenna problem," Fossett said.
He cautioned that other problems could arise and there was still a long way to go.
"There may be new things that come up so there's no real basis for confidence," he said, "but I'm happy with the situation."
At Mission Control, flight controllers were carefully monitoring fuel consumption.
"One of the critical factors we are monitoring is the amount of fuel he has left," said project manager Paul Moore.
"He's eaten quite substantially into his fuel (so far) but that's as we expected."
Moore said the GPS problem had been potentially fatal to the flight.
"This could have been a showstopper," he said.
"This was really a big worry as we are unable to fly without GPS especially when were out of radio range.
"Steve was essentially flying blind," Moore said.
"Happily, after a couple of hours of malfunction the GPS system did reengage."
Moore said cabin pressure was good and the temperature in the cramped cockpit was 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius).
"His feet are a bit chilly," said Moore.
The three day journey will test the endurance and piloting abilities of Fossett, a 60 year old millionaire who has set dozens of world records and world firsts with jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing.
At takeoff, the 3350 pound (1522 kilogram) single engine aircraft was carrying nearly 19000 pounds (8636 kilograms) of fuel in 13 tanks for the 23000 mile (37260 kilometer) journey at altitudes as high as 52000 feet (15850 meters).
Virgin Atlantic Airways of Sir Richard Branson is funding the GlobalFlyer and the British entrepreneur is in Salina monitoring the flight.
The GlobalFlyer was designed by aviation legend Burt Rutan, who recently made headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10 million dollar "X Prize" for sending a privately designed craft into space twice in two weeks.
Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to set a record of nine days for a non stop, non refueled flight around the world.
Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 hours, and by doing it on his own.
One hundred one years after the Wright brothers ushered in the age of powered flight, Steve Fossett is ready to tackle what may be the last great challenge in world aviation.
From Kansas, not Kitty Hawk.
Weather permitting, the 60 year old millionaire will take off from the Salina, Kan., municipal airport today and be back three days later, by way of Montreal, London, Paris, Rome, Cairo, Egypt, Bahrain, Karachi, Pakistan, Calcutta, India, Shanghai, Tokyo, Honolulu, and Los Angeles.
There will be no stops.
No refueling.
And not much sleep for Fossett, who will be wedged in the 7 foot cockpit of a veritable flying fuel tank as he attempts the first solo flight around the world on one tank of gas.
If he's successful, Fossett will earn a place in history alongside aviator Wiley Post, who circled the globe alone in 1933 in a single engine airplane, the Winnie Mae.
Post made 11 stops and took just under eight8 days.
"Flying around the world has always been a great adventure," Fossett says.
"I hope to make it with no stops and in under 80 hours."
It won't be his first around the world flight.
In 2002, he became the first person to solo the globe in a balloon a 14 day odyssey, which began and ended in Australia.
It was his sixth attempt.
The solo aspect of the record is important to Fossett.
"Ninety one people flew across the Atlantic before (Charles) LIndbergh did," he says.
"The hallmarks of aviation are that solo flights are ranked higher than crew flights just because of the difficulty and the level of self reliance required."
He may be flying solo, but he will be supported by more than 40 engineers, meteorologists and pilots at Salina "mission control" who will advise him by radio as he circles the globe.
A network of amateur spotters will report "Fossett sightings" as he travels.
And a chase plane will rendezvous with him several times during the three day flight.
Fossett, who made his fortune as a trader on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, is the most visible of three aviation giants who have pooled their talents for the record attempt.
Virgin Atlantic Airways founder and chairman Richard Branson, himself an avid balloonist, is funding the $2.5 million project, which he calls "the last great aviation record inside the Earth's atmosphere and the first great aviation achievement of this century."
Branson, whose $2.2 billion net worth makes him No. 247 on Forbes' list of the world's richest people, isn't fretting about the cost.
Besides, he says the flight will demonstrate technology that will help develop "a new generation of more fuel efficient commercial aircraft."
The airplane is decked out in the red and white livery of Branson's airline, but the craft is the brainchild of aviation design genius Burt Rutan, whose SpaceShipOne last year became the first privately built craft to reach the edge of space.
Rutan won the $10 million Ansari X Prize for the advancement of space tourism.
The Virgin Atlantic Global Flyer first sketched by Rutan on the back of a napkin in 1999 is undoubtedly one of the strangest looking flying machines ever to take wing over the Kansas heartland.
Built by Rutan's Scaled Composites of Mojave, Calif., it consists of two 44 foot lightweight carbon fiber torpedoes joined at the hip.
A cigar shaped cockpit is suspended between, with a single jet engine a modified turbofan like those used in corporate jets mounted above and behind the cockpit.
Fossett has to sit on padded cushions to see out of the bubble like canopy.
The design is so aerodynamically perfect that the plane has to deploy two drogue parachutes to help it descend for a landing.
With a 114 foot wing span that makes it 2 1/2 times wider than it is long, however, the contraption looks like it might have trouble just getting off the ground.
Taking off may, in fact, be one of the toughest challenges.
Fully loaded, the plane carries 3000 gallons of jet fuel, six times its own weight.
Commercial airliners carry less than half their weight in fuel.
At takeoff, because so much fuel is stored in the plane's hollow wings, they will droop to within 3 feet of the runway meaning any sudden gust of wind could become an adventure ending disaster.
"It's an experimental aircraft with such lightweight construction there's a risk of structural failure," Fossett says.
"The first time it flies with a full load of fuel will be when I take off on the mission.
If I miscalculate, I will run right into the cornfields."
The dicey aspects of the takeoff are one reason Fossett chose the Salina airport.
Its 12300 foot runway and a 1300 foot overrun built when it was Schilling Air Force Base provide plenty of room for the Global Flyer to get up to takeoff speed.
Once he is airborne, Fossett intends to climb to around 50000 feet, well above the altitude flown by commercial traffic.
The plane will be so heavy early in the flights that he'll have to avoid the turbulence of the jet stream.
As the plane's fuel load lightens, however, the jet stream will play a major role in whether Fossett will make it home.
As he crosses Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific Ocean, he hopes to use the tailwind to add an average of 70 miles to his ground speed and increase his range.
The Global Flyer carries only enough fuel to cover 20000 miles in still air a good 3000 miles short of the 36787.559 kilometer minimum distance required for the arbiter of world aviation records, the Paris based Federation Aeronautique Internationale, to recognize the feat.
But Fossett has another reason for using a midcontinent location for his takeoff and return.
In the final hours, he'll be running close to empty.
"If I run out of fuel in the last thousand miles, I will be able to glide to a safe landing at almost any airport in the western United States," he says.
"If I had chosen a West Coast airport, I would risk ditching in the Pacific."
So critical is the jet stream to Fossett's ambitions both as an early obstacle and a late in the game friend that the flight has already been delayed more than two weeks in hopes of a more favorable alignment.
Although the plane has been ready to fly since Feb 2, the weather has prompted several delays.
A meteorological "go" requires the proper speed and course of winds aloft, the right local weather (cold and calm) for the absence of any major storms along Fossett's planned route.
"Looking at the behavior of the jet stream over the last five5 or 10 years, things only line up the way we need them about 50 percent of the time," says David Dehenauw, a Belgian meteorologist doing long range forecasting for the flight.
The Global Flyer won't be the first airplane to circle the world without refueling.
Voyager, an earlier Rutan creation that now hangs in the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum, did that in 1986.
But Voyager had two pilots, Burt Rutan's older brother Richard Rutan and pilot Jeana Yeager.
It also had two engines and a speed that averaged a little over 100 miles an hour.
Because it couldn't fly high enough to make use of the jet stream, the flight took nine days and nearly failed when it had to be rerouted due to Libya's refusal to let the plane enter its airspace.
Unlike his marathon balloon flights, which have allowed time for napping, Fossett cruising at nearly 300 miles an hour will have to stay awake for most, if not all, of the 80 hours he is airborne.
But as a precaution, the plane also carries a control system that would maintain the course in the event Fossett nods off.
Fossett hasn't said publicly what he'll do if he doesn't make it, but his earlier balloon flights have made it clear that he doesn't quit easily.
His successful around the world flight in 2002 was his sixth attempt in eight years including one flight that ended in a near disaster when a thunderstorm shredded his balloon and he had to ditch off the coast of Australia.
He was picked up by a passing yacht and promptly began making preparations for his next attempt.

The early stages of American adventurer Steve Fossett's bid to make the first solo non stop flight around the world without refueling aboard the GlobalFlyer have gone "exactly as planned", organizers said.
"Mission control has spoken with Steve and he reports that everything is working well and that he is extremely pleased with progress so far," project manager Paul Moore told a press briefing late Monday.
After weeks of weather delays, the GlobalFlyer took off at 6:47 pm (0047 GMT Tuesday) from Salina Municipal Airport on a journey expected to last between 60 and 80 hours.
Hundreds of spectators lined the tarmac and cheered as the aircraft, heavily laden down by fuel, trundled down the runway and rose into the darkening sky.
There was a brief moment of anxiety when the craft appeared to lose altitude seconds after taking off, before it regained height and climbed into the skies.
Fossett spoke briefly to reporters before climbing into the cramped cockpit.
"I'm feeling good.
I'm feeling healthy.
It's going to be a long night tonight and a long night tomorrow night," he said.
The three day journey will test Fossetts endurance and his abilities as a pilot.
The delicate, light bodied airplane has been built with very little margin for complications like turbulence and Fossett will need to keep a close eye on the fuel distribution to ensure that the plane remains properly balanced.
The greatest potential for structural problems came during the first two hours of the flight when Fossett maneuvered the plane through the ground winds and potential turbulence.
At takeoff, the 3350 pound (1522 kilogram) single engine aircraft was carrying nearly 19000 pounds (8636 kilograms) of fuel in 13 tanks for the 23000 mile (37260 kilometer) journey at altitudes as high as 52000 feet (15850 meters).
Fossett is wearing a chest pack with a parachute and should be able to bail out in less than two minutes if he encounters any critical failures.
Once he reaches his cruising altitude of about 45000 feet (13000 meters) he can expect a smoother ride.
By 10:00pm (0400 GMT, Tuesday) Fossett had traveled 1400 kilometers (869 miles) and was approaching Canadian airspace after having passed over Chicago and Detroit.
He was flying at an altitude of 38000 feet (11580 meters) at an approximate speed of 310 knots (357 miles per hour).
While in the air, Fossett will be in near constant contact with mission control here via a NASA designed communication system.
"It was obviously an emotional moment in that I was standing with Steve Fossett's wife.
It was a dangerous moment and an enormous relief when it got off the ground and left Salina," said British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, whose Virgin Atlantic Airways is funding the daring venture.
"Something I never thought I would get to say was 'next stop Salina,'" Branson said.
A chase plane is following Fossett along the route in order to document the flight and provide support should he be forced into an early landing.
Fossett has been equipped with an emergency beacon which would alert search and rescue teams to his exact position.
Fossett has little room to stretch in the 7.7 foot long (2.3 meter long) cabin and will sustain himself with diet milkshakes.
Despite the dangers, Fossett said he is determined to try to capture the "most important aviation records that have been left undone."
"It's worth the risk," he said.
The project brings together three giants of aviation and adventure.
Fossett has set dozens of world records and world firsts with jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing.
The former stock options trader became famous in the mid 1990s when he made an attempt with Branson to circumnavigate the globe in a hot air balloon.
He managed the trip solo on his sixth attempt in the summer of 2002.
Branson has set a number of sailing and aviation records in his own right while promoting the Virgin brand.
He will monitor Fossett's progress from mission control in Salina.
The GlobalFlyer was designed by aviation legend Burt Rutan, who recently made headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10 million dollar "X Prize" for sending a privately designed craft into space twice in two weeks.
Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to set a record of nine days for a non stop, non refueled flight around the world.
Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 hours, and by doing it on his own.
Once he clears the Canadian province of Newfoundland, Fossett will head across the Atlantic Ocean to Africa.
He hopes pass above Casablanca before he continuing on towards Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, China, South Korea and Japan.
Kansas town basks in glow og GlobalFlyer By LAURA BAUER The Kansas City Star SALINA, Kan. Anytime Jeff Palmer hears a plane overhead, he peers out the front window of Mr G's Market.
"I look to see if it's the GlobalFlyer," says Palmer, who from behind the store counter demonstrates how he bends down and tilts his head toward the sky.
For more than two weeks the store cashier has been peering out this window, hoping to get a glimpse of the cutting edge plane designed to break yet another aviation record for millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett.
Having already shattered records in a hot air balloon and a glider, Fossett hopes to soon become the first to make a solo, nonstop flight around the world without refueling.
As early as next Sunday, the first window of opportunity, Palmer should get a pretty good look at the plane as Fossett and the Virgin Atlantic team attempt the feat from the Salina airport, less than a mile from Mr G's.
The team was attracted to the central Kansas town and its airport for the extra long runway and newly renovated hangar 703.
It's inside hangar 703 where the GlobalFlyer, with its 114 feet wing span and 13 gas tanks, has been housed and worked on since it arrived from Mojave, Calif., on Jan 6.
While the team waits for good weather around the world, constantly measuring barometric pressures and monitoring jet streams, residents are preparing for what they say is their town's best bet to get into the history books.
Employees at the Holiday Inn are ready to roll out their red carpet literally for the hordes of international and national reporters and television crews.
The hotel bar is concocting a special GlobalFlyer drink, with ingredients not yet revealed.
"It'll be like the flight," says smiling Holiday Inn sales manager Gala Bloyd, referring to how the details of the mission are kept under wraps until closer to the departure.
"We'll announce that (the ingredients) when they take off."
The welcome parties are planned for people like Virgin Atlantic's chairman, Sir Richard Branson, and town leaders have scheduled tours to introduce Salina to an international audience.
Hundreds of volunteers are lined up to make sure guests are treated right.
"This gives us the opportunity to introduce our visitors here to what this community is all about," says Gerald Cook, president of the Salina Area Chamber of Commerce, who has already fielded questions from reporters in New York, London and Italy.
"It's a show and tell, if you will."
But before all that, and before Fossett hits the sky for what could be up to an 80 hour flight, some preparations remain.
For Fossett, the crews from Virgin Atlantic and Scaled Composites (which designed and built the plane) and the Kansas State University Airway Science students who've become an integral part of the mission, there's a lot of unfinished business.
When officials with Virgin Atlantic came to look at the Salina airport facilities and runway, which measures 12300 feet long, they visited Salina's K State campus.
The location's main focus is its College of Technology and Aviation.
By that time Salina officials knew there was a good probability the town would be the location for the launch and the landing.
But they had no idea where the flight would be controlled from, or in more technical terms, where Mission Control would be.
"It could have been in London, Hong Kong, anywhere," says Tim Rogers, executive director of the Salina Airport Authority.
But "when they saw the campus facility, immediately the light came on for Virgin Atlantic staffers, 'This is ideal for Mission Control.'
" Shortly after the announcement was made that the entire mission would take place in Salina, school officials got in touch with several Airway Science students aspiring professional pilots and airplane mechanics.
From there, 12 students were hand picked to help on the mission.
They thought they would run a few errands, do minor research and, if they were lucky, pick up valuable knowledge from seasoned aviation professionals.
Monica Chester, a senior from Phillipsburg in the professional pilot program, laughs now as she and three other students describe how they are instead helping map the mission's flight plan by researching weather patterns and jet streams.
And the eight aviation mechanics students are helping improve and repair the plane to ensure a successful mission.
"It's definitely not a stand back and see how it's done kind of job," Chester says.
"It's step up and get it done."
Under the supervision of Philip Grassa, the crew chief from Scaled Composites, the aviation mechanics students work nearly every day on the plane.
After a test flight, the students helped repair a valve that was causing trouble with cabin pressure.
Earlier last week the students installed the flight tires on the plane.
The tires were new, but the tread was shaved down to save on weight.
"They didn't think they'd get to work on the airplane as an actual mechanic," says Grassa, who has worked on GlobalFlyer for two years.
"They thought they'd be running errands for me."
Grassa hollers, "How we doing over there?" to a small group working on a shield to go over the flight controls in the back of the cabin.
After offering a suggestion of where to put glue, Grassa was back to talking about the students and how they have been integral in helping get GlobalFlyer ready.
"This is basically my adopted crew for the preparation for this mission," Grassa says.
Some of the students get wide eyes as they talk about working with Scaled Composites employees and with Fossett whom senior Seth Short from Burrton describes as "your grandpa in real good physical shape.
He's as nice as can be."
As Chester puts it: "We hoped we'd get to meet him, but now we're on a first name basis with him."
For the students in the professional pilot program, their work is in front of the computer calculating fluctuations in the weather.
They balance the benefits of flying at high altitudes where the jet engine is more efficient versus lower where a plane gets the best winds.
Short explains how the weather needs to be just right.
"We're looking for cold weather, high barometric pressure and favorable jet stream," says Short.
"He can't take off in any precipitation that would freeze."
Another pilot student, Nancy Milleret of Tonganoxie, jumps in to interpret.
"You don't want ice on the plane," says the junior who is used to breaking down aviation talk to the students she guides in the air.
"Ice is bad."
That's because the plane is not equipped with de icing gear.
That would add weight to the plane.
And for a trip around the world without refueling, extra weight is also bad.
Student Pat Rinearson of Olathe explains why the plane needs the favorable jet stream.
"He wants the tail winds," Rinearson says.
"The jet stream moves every minute.
What we're trying to do is figure out where it is and average what the tail wind component will be through the flight."
The plane will travel east to west.
It doesn't have enough gas to make the 20000 nautical mile trip without the benefit of tail winds.
As Milleret explains: "West to east, he wouldn't make it.
He'd be going against the wind."
Whatever the students come up with in their research and calculations, they often show to Fossett.
"What we put into the computer, Steve looks at that," Short says.
"When we come up with a flight plan, we show it to Steve and he says, 'Explain it to me.'
" As the students work, the town and nearby residents wait.
The No. 1 question airport director Rogers gets: "Can we see the airplane?"
Looks like Palmer isn't the only one disappointed that there has been no general public viewing of the plane.
"It's the question everyone has," says Rogers, who has watched the airport's Web site go from 500 hits a day to 20000 because of interest in GlobalFlyer.
Rogers says that "time is the most critical part of the process" and taking time out to show the airplane would hurt the preparation phase.
"Once I've had the opportunity to explain that, individuals seem to understand," Rogers says.
On the day of departure and landing, the airport can accommodate as many as 30000 spectators.
Two areas have been set up, one on the north side and one at the south, for people to watch.
Some still think the residents deserve a special viewing.
"You'd think they should just fly over the town someday," says Dustin Forsberg, 23, as he sat outside Cozy Inn Hamburgers with his brother Derek and a friend.
"Just as a 'Thanks for letting us be here.'
" Others say that while having the flight take off and land in Salina is exciting, it's what the mission does for the town that beats all.
Cook, the chamber president, estimates the town has already benefited from "millions of dollars" in advertising and the plane still sits in hangar 703.
"It's going to put Salina on the map," says aviation student Samuel Butler, originally from Cleveland, as he stands outside the town's municipal airport.
"That's what I like about it,It's history."

US adventurer Steve Fossett was approaching the coast of Pakistan late Tuesday after overcoming a navigation equipment problem that threatened to derail his historic bid to make the first non stop flight around the world without refueling.
Fossett, who took off from here in the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer on Monday for a flight expected to last between 60 and 80 hours, said he had to deal with a number of "dramas" during takeoff but the flight was going well overall.
At 03:30 GMT, Fossett was at 48197 feet (14700 meters) and had been in the air for nearly 27 hours.
The GlobalFlyer was over the Arabian sea heading east towards Karachi, Pakistan at speeds of around 340 knots (390 miles per hour/630 kilometers per hour).
Earlier in the day, in a radio hook up with reporters at Mission Control in Salina, Fossett said he had a "good chance" of completing the record breaking flight.
"I have picked up a 100 mile per hour (160 kilometers) jet stream just behind mew and I am covering territory fast, which is very encouraging," he said.
"It's interesting to watch things go by and I am looking forward to another good day tomorrow."
The most serious problem was a temporary failure of the Global Positioning System, or GPS, Fossett's satellite navigation aid.
"This was my sole source of navigation so this was very serious," he said, adding that the GPS had not functioned for about half of his flight over Canada.
"I believe it was an antenna problem," Fossett said.
He cautioned that other problems could arise and there was still a long way to go.
"There may be new things that come up so there's no real basis for confidence," he said, "but I'm happy with the situation."
At Mission Control, flight controllers were carefully monitoring fuel consumption.
"One of the critical factors we are monitoring is the amount of fuel he has left," said project manager Paul Moore.
"He's eaten quite substantially into his fuel (so far) but that's as we expected."
Moore said the GPS problem had been potentially fatal to the flight.
"This could have been a showstopper," he said.
"This was really a big worry as we are unable to fly without GPS especially when were out of radio range.
"Steve was essentially flying blind," Moore said.
"Happily, after a couple of hours of malfunction the GPS system did reengage."
Moore s Celsius).
"His feet are a bit chilly," said Moore.
Fossett nonetheless reported being "comfortable enough" in the 7.7 foot (2.3 meter) long cockpit.
"I have got elbow room, I can get to everything, I'm not complaining," he said.
"It is a long trip especially the nights.
I feel a little bit tired but I have been through this before and I am going to be okay."
The three day journey will test the endurance and piloting abilities of Fossett, a 60 year old millionaire who has set dozens of world records and world firsts with jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing.
At takeoff, the 3350 pound (1522 kilogram) single engine aircraft was carrying nearly 19000 pounds (8636 kilograms) of fuel in 13 tanks for the 23000 mile (37260 kilometer) journey at altitudes as high as 52000 feet (15850 meters).
Virgin Atlantic Airways of Sir Richard Branson is funding the GlobalFlyer and the British entrepreneur is in Salina monitoring the flight.
The GlobalFlyer was designed by aviation legend Burt Rutan, who recently made headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10 million dollar "X Prize" for sending a privately designed craft into space twice in two weeks.
Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to set a record of nine days for a non stop, non refueled flight around the world.
Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 hours, and by doing it on his own.
The Irish Republican Army declared an end to its campaign of violence against Britain that claimed more than 3500 lives over 36 years, saying there was "an alternative way to achieve" its goal of a United Ireland.
The announcement in a DVD released to reporters was taken in London as, potentially, a profound shift in Northern Ireland's destiny, reversing decades of Republican commitment to violence in the effort to end British rule.
"This may be the day on which, finally, after all these false dawns and dashed hopes, peace replaced war, politics replaces terror on the island of Ireland," Prime Minister Tony Blair said in a televised statement in London.
He also said the announcement "creates the circumstances" in which Northern Ireland's power sharing local government could be revived.
"This is a step of unparalleled magnitude in the recent history of Northern Ireland."
The Irish Prime Minister, Bertie Aherne, struck a more cautious note, saying the IRA statement would be momentous if the organization matched words with deeds.
Among the troubling issues is whether the IRA will halt the criminal operations such as armed robbery, smuggling and money laundering that fund the organization.
The IRA said that its members must not engage in any other activities whatsoever, but skeptics worry that the organization may break up into small independent crime gangs.
The statement by the IRA said: "Our decisions have been taken to advance our republican and democratic objectives, including our goal of a united Ireland.
We believe there is now an alternative way to achieve this and to end British rule in our country."
"All IRA units have been ordered to dump arms," said the statement, which was read out on a DVD by a former prisoner, Seana Walsh.
Blair said Unionists the IRA's foes would want to ensure that the "clear statement of principal is kept to in practice."
The widely expected statement could mark the conclusion of the bloodiest chapter in modern Irish history, foretold in 1994, when an IRA cease fire began winding up the tradition of militant Irish republicanism.
And it takes a step towards restoring Northern Ireland's local government, which was established under a 1998 peace accord but suspended in 2002 due to allegations of IRA activity.Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, said at a news conference in Dublin that the announcement could "help revive the peace process" and said it was a challenge to the British and Irish governments as well as the Ulster Unionists to see that the peace accord is carried out.
Unionists, the province's largest political group who are mostly Protestant, are likely to insist on a delay of at least a year before returning to share seats in the provincial legislature with Sinn Fein.
"There are still a number of areas of loose ends," Jeffrey Donaldson, a Northern Irish member of the British parliament for the hard line Democratic Unionists, told RTE radio.
"We'll probably need a period of time now over which we can judge whether what the IRA says is what they actually do."
The statement came four months after Adams, who denies repeated reports that he has been an IRA commander, called on the guerrilla group to embrace purely political and democratic activity.
Top Sinn Fein representatives are in Washington, London and Brussels to brief international leaders on the IRA decision.
The loose ends include the possible continuation of IRA criminal operations.
Police blame the IRA for crimes like the robbery of $50 million from a Belfast bank last December, and the murder of a Belfast man, Robert McCartney, in January, but no prosecutions have followed in either case.
Mainstream politicians want Sinn Fein, and its IRA supporters, to endorse Northern Ireland's fledgling police service, which has been revamped to gain the trust of Roman Catholics, who suffered from discrimination in the past.
Dismantling the IRA's massive stashes of weapons, which are mostly hidden in underground bunkers in the countryside, has been the most stubborn obstacle to a functioning power sharing system between Roman Catholic and Protestant political groups in Northern Ireland.
The IRA has destroyed arms dumps on three separate occasions with the cooperation of John DeChastelain, the retired Canadian general who heads a commission supervising disarmament.
But Unionist parties withdrew from government on several occasions after the 1998 pact in protest at the slow pace of the process.
The IRA said on Wednesday that it would complete "the process to verifiably put its arms beyond use", and that it invited Protestant and Catholic clergymen to serve as witnesses so that disarmament can be completed "as quickly as possible."
Analysts said that, based on DeChastelain's previous methods, the issue would likely be dealt with in a matter of days.
Last December, the Democratic Unionists, led by the firebrand preacher Ian Paisley, scuttled an effort to restore Northern Ireland's government by demanding photographic evidence that the arms had been destroyed, which the IRA refused.
Paisley's party, which favors continued union with Britain, indicated it would take months to negotiate a revival of Northern Ireland's power sharing assembly.
Even before the IRA statement was issued, Paisley told the BBC: "I am saying now the proof of the pudding is in the eating and digesting of it.
We've heard it all before.
You can wrap it up any way you like, put a new bit of ribbon on the package but we want the action, the proof this is happening."
Paisley's party refuses to talk to Sinn Fein and says it is indistinguishable from the IRA.
The Irish Republican Army has renounced its armed struggle for a united Ireland, agreeing to turn solely to political methods, an American businessman said Tuesday after being briefed on a statement expected from the guerrilla group later this week.
The agreement, if borne out, would be a historic turning point in the violent history of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
But there is still widespread official skepticism about IRA promises, particularly when it comes to the issue of disarmament.
Indeed, it was not immediately clear whether the IRA would address how several tons of arms, hidden in bunkers across Ireland, would be disposed of, according to the businessman, Niall O'Dowd, who brokered talks between the IRA and American officials that helped lead to a cease fire in 1994.
The continued existence of those weapons, which were to have been destroyed under an agreement reached after the cease fire, contributed to the collapse of the Northern Ireland government in 2003.
On Tuesday night, an Irish government spokesman said an IRA commitment to nonviolence had to be backed by an unambiguous process for disposing of all its weapons.
"The ultimate test is the delivery on that," said the spokesman, who as a matter of routine practice spoke only on the condition that he not be identified.
A spokesman for the British government declined comment.
A number of recent signs have pointed to major developments occurring within the IRA.
On Tuesday, Ireland's justice minister, Michael McDowell, said the top leaders of the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, including Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, had stepped down from positions on the IRA's secretive governing council.
In addition, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland was cutting short a vacation to return to Dublin later this week.
John DeChastelain, a Canadian general who is the chairman of a commission set up to oversee the destruction of paramilitary weapons, is in Ireland this week, the Irish government spokesman said.
And McGuinness is to go to Washington on Thursday to brief American officials on the peace process, according to Rita O'Hare, Sinn Fein's representative in the United States.
The developments follow a public appeal by Adams in April, in which he urged the republican movement to turn away from violent struggle and to devote all its energies to politics.
Adams said he had justified the IRA's activities in the past because no alternative existed for people who did not wish to submit to British authority.
"That struggle can now be taken forward by other means," Adams said in a speech in Belfast.
He asked, "Can you take courageous initiatives which will achieve your aims by purely political and democratic activity?"
O'Dowd, the publisher of a magazine, Irish America, and a newspaper, Irish Voice, said Adams and other senior republicans had persuaded the IRA membership that it could succeed politically.
Sinn Fein is now the second largest party in Northern Ireland, and it has made significant gains among voters in the Republic of Ireland since 1994.
"This is a truly historic moment in Irish history," O'Dowd said.
"It is the first time since the founding of the Irish state that the IRA has agreed that there should be no armed struggle.
Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness have taken an armed revolutionary movement and succeeded in placing it on a political path.
Irish history is littered with people such as Michael Collins, who tried to do the same and failed."
However, the IRA's failure to disarm since 1994 has created much official skepticism about its motives and statements.
"There is no position whatsoever between being armed and being unarmed for the IRA," said McDowell, the justice minister.
"If the IRA are decommissioning, they must decommission all their weapons in their entirety, every single pistol, every single bullet, the lot."
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan hailed the decision of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to disarm and end armed actions in Northern Ireland, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Thursday.
In a statement issued by the spokesman, Annan said he welcomed the announcement by the IRA that it has decided to end armed actions in Northern Ireland and disarm.
The Secretary General believed this decision, if fully implemented, will be "a watershed in the history of Northern Ireland," Dujarric said.
Annan hoped the IRA will commit fully to the obligation it has just undertaken, and called on all parties concerned to seize this unique opportunity to consolidate the Good Friday Agreement, the spokesman added.
An IRA statement said on Thursday that it would put an end to its armed struggle and devote efforts towards peaceful solutions.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on Thursday hailed the Irish Republican Army (IRA)'s pledge to end its armed struggle for a united Northern Ireland and urged all parties to seize the opportunity to consolidate their power sharing agreement.
"The Secretary General welcomes the announcement by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) that it has decided to end armed actions in Northern Ireland and disarm," Annan said through his spokesman, Stephane Dujarric.
"This decision, if fully implemented, will be a watershed in the history of Northern Ireland."
The IRA on Thursday ordered its militants to end the armed campaign in Northern Ireland and become a political movement, the paramilitary group said in a historic statement.
But the statement said the organization would not disband as North Ireland's leading Protestants demand.
Annan expressed the hope that IRA "will commit fully to the obligation it has just undertaken" and called "on all parties concerned to seize this unique opportunity to consolidate the Good Friday (power sharing) Agreement.
Hopes Northern Ireland's Irish Republican Army will make a long awaited statement committing itself to democratic means were raised Tuesday as Ireland's deputy prime minister said she expected news later this week.
Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrat Party, the junior partner in Prime Minister Bertie Ahern's ruling coalition, said she hoped the IRA statement would see an end to "criminality in Ireland in all its forms once and for all".
In April, Gerry Adams, the leader of the political wing of the IRA, Sinn Fein, made a direct appeal to the Roman Catholic paramilitary group to embrace purely political and democratic activity.
The Irish and British governments had been hoping for a response to the call at some point during the summer.
"I certainly hope it (the statement) will be substantial," Harney told Ireland's RTE state radio.
"There have been many false dawns.
I hope on this occasion that it is not a false dawn and that we can put the muddy past of paramilitarism totally and utterly behind us, and that everybody embraces politics and all that that involves peaceful politics and democratic politics."
The IRA, which declared a ceasefire in its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland before the 1998 Good Friday peace deal that largely ended 30 years of violence, has been holding consultations with members.
The Irish media has reported that three senior Sinn Fein leaders, including Adams and chief negotiator Martin McGuinness, have stepped down from their posts on the seven man ruling body of the IRA.
In an unprecedented charge in January, Irish Justice Minister Michael McDowell claimed the trio were leaders of both the political and military wings of the movement.
However, in a joint statement the Sinn Fein leaders "categorically" denied they were members of the outlawed IRA's ruling body, and accused McDowell of abusing his office.
Even if the IRA commits itself to ending violence, Northern Ireland could still be bogged down by the sort of factional bickering which saw a solution to the current political deadlock scuppered just before Christmas.
Protestant factions in Northern Ireland, particularly the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) led by veteran hardliner Ian Paisley, are adamant that there can be no lasting settlement without a move by the IRA to end all paramilitary and criminal activity and to decommission its weapons.
The Good Friday agreement paved the way for a Protestant Catholic power sharing assembly in Belfast, but that was suspended more than two years ago amid allegations of IRA espionage.
Hopes of a new political settlement were dashed in December when moves to destroy IRA arms caches were halted following Protestant demands the process be photographed, something Sinn Fein rejected as an unnecessary humiliation.
A spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair welcomed Thursday what he called a "very positive" statement from the Irish Republican Army leadership to end its armed campaign in Northern Ireland.
The spokesman welcomed the IRA leadership's clear call to "end" the armed campaign and renounce "any other activities whatsoever," which he interpreted as an end to criminal activities.
The second phrase "is very important," the spokesman told AFP.
Overall the statement "is very positive," he added.
Gerry Adams, the leader of the Sinn Fein political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), confirmed Thursday that the Roman Catholic paramilitary group was on the verge of making a significant statement.
"The forthcoming IRA statement will challenge Irish Republicans (Sinn Fein) and nationalists (other Catholics).
I appeal to everyone to carefully read what the army has to say and to remain united and steadfast," he said.
"The IRA statement will also challenge others, especially the two governments and the (Protestant) Unionists," Adams said in a statement distributed by Sinn Fein in the Irish capital of Dublin.
"The Dublin political establishment in particular will have a lot of soul searching to do, if those in the political leadership are to meet the needs of the upcoming period," Adams said, without elaborating.
The underground guerrilla movement which has been fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland for 30 years is expected to respond to British Irish calls for it to renounce violence once and for all.
The appeal was reinforced on April 6 when Adams urged the IRA to take the "historic" decision to abandon the armed struggle and engage in a political process for peace in Northern Ireland.
A historic pledge by the Irish Republican Army to lay down their arms and adopt peaceful means to end British rule in Northern Ireland took effect at 4:00 pm (1500 GMT) Thursday.
The Roman Catholic paramilitary group, which has led a bloody campaign to unite mostly Protestant Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic for more than three decades, promised to end their armed struggle in an unprecedented statement released a few hours earlier.
Senior figures in Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army linked party, departed Wednesday for the United States ahead of an expected major new peace declaration from the outlawed IRA.
The British, Irish and U.S. governments have been pressing since December for the IRA to disarm fully and disband in support of Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord.
The pact's key goal a joint Catholic Protestant administration for the British territory has been hold since 2002 because of Protestant refusal to cooperate with Sinn Fein, the major Catholic backed party.
The British and Irish governments both expect the IRA to release a new policy statement soon, perhaps on Thursday, outlining its future intentions.
Both governments insist the IRA must disarm fully and renounce violence and criminal activity commitments the IRA has refused to give in the past.
Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness and the party's North American representative, Rita O'Hare, were planning to meet supporters in the U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush's envoy to Northern Ireland, Mitchell Reiss.
In a sign of recent U.S. pressure on the Sinn Fein IRA movement, O'Hare in February was barred from traveling into the United States the first time that happened since she became Sinn Fein's senior U.S. based lobbyist in 1998.
O'Hare has been on the run from British justice since the early 1970s in Northern Ireland, where she absconded on bail while awaiting trial on charge of attempting to murder British soldiers.
The Irish Republican Army on Thursday ordered its militants to end its armed campaign in Northern Ireland, the paramilitary group said in a historic statement.
It said IRA militants have been instructed to abandon their weapons and "end the armed campaign."
Britain expects an "imminent" statement from the IRA as to whether the Northern Irish paramilitary group is to agree to an appeal from its political wing to abandon violence, a government minister said Monday.
The comments from Northern Ireland Minister Peter Hain who said the IRA statement could "open a new chapter" for the British ruled region came as it was announced that Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern would meet in London this week.
The pair would meet at the House of Commons on Wednesday, officials in Dublin said, with Ahern also holding talks with Ian Paisley, leader of Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant political group, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
London and Dublin are awaiting for an Irish Republican Army response to a call from Gerry Adams, leader of the group's Sinn Fein political wing, for an end to violence.
In April, Adams called on the IRA to "fully embrace and accept" democratic means and end all paramilitary activities.
"I am confident, now, with an imminent IRA statement expected, which I hope will be credible, that it will open a new chapter in Northern Irish politics," Hain told BBC Radio Ulster.
Hopes are rising in Northern Ireland that the IRA will, by the end of June, announce a plan for a complete and swift process of disarmament.
A deal on the so called "decommissioning" of IRA weapons was almost reached at the end of last year, but foundered on demands from the DUP that the process by verified through photographs.
Northern Ireland has seen a virtual end to more than 30 years of violence since the landmark 1998 Good Friday peace deal, but Dublin and London, as well as an independent monitoring body, have accused paramilitary groups of continued criminal activities.
The IRA's alleged misdeeds were highlighted by a massive bank raid in Belfast in December, blamed by police on the group, as well as the murder of Robert McCartney, a Belfast man beaten and stabbed to death in a bar in what his relatives say was an attack carried out by IRA activists.
Northern Ireland's 7 year old peace accord will eventually work but requires the Irish Republican Army to deliver a "clear and decisive" end to all its activities, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said Friday.
In a speech to British and Irish academics at University College Dublin, Ahern said the U.S. brokered Good Friday pact of 1998 contained a complex set of goals that, if achieved, would ensure a stable, peaceful Northern Ireland.
But he said the pact's key goal a joint Catholic Protestant administration would be revived only "in the context of a complete end to IRA paramilitarism and criminality and the putting beyond use of their weapons."
The major Protestant party, the Democratic Unionists, refuses to cooperate with Sinn Fein, the IRA linked party that represents most Catholics, citing the IRA's continued underground activities.
Last month, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, a reputed IRA commander, appealed to IRA members to leave behind their "armed struggle" in favor of democratic politics.
"We now need the IRA to deliver a clear and decisive response to Gerry Adams' recent appeal," Ahern said.
"I hope that this response will be translated into clear reality on the ground."
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern were to chair the first major review of the Northern Ireland situation since the British general election in May at a meeting in London later Monday.
The talks, which will include senior ministers from both sides, were being held under the auspices of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) which was set up under the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement.
The discussions were to cover political developments in Northern Ireland, security and criminal justice matters, policing, the marching season involving the Protestant loyalist Orange Order, human rights and equality, cross border matters in Ireland and Anglo Irish questions.
BIIGC meetings are normally only attended by the Irish foreign minister and the British secretary of state for Northern Ireland but there is provision to scale them up to "summit level" involving both prime ministers.
"The holding of a meeting of the BIIGC at summit level is a demonstration of the close working and high level partnership between the two governments," the Irish government statement said.
"It is also a demonstration of the commitment of the two governments to pursue progress across the range of issues embraced by the Good Friday agreement."
The London summit was taking place as all sides in Northern Ireland wait to see if the Protestant marching season passes peacefully and if the Irish Republican Army (IRA) will respond positively to an appeal from Gerry Adams, leader of its Sinn Fein political wing, to disarm and fully embrace democracy.
Protestant factions in Northern Ireland are adamant that there can be no political progress toward a lasting peace settlement without a move by the IRA to end all criminal and paramilitary activity.
Speaking to reporters earlier Monday, Blair repeated his call for republicans to unequivocally give up violence and commit themselves to wholly democratic methods.
"I think it is going to be very difficult to persuade unionism of the sincerity of any republican move, which is why that move has got to be clear and bold," he said.
"It's immensely important that they do make this move,If it is done and it is done genuinely and violence is genuinely given up, then the obligation then transfers to unionists to make sure that they drop their opposition to going into a power sharing executive."
The IRA declared a ceasefire in its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland before the 1998 peace deal, which largely ended 30 years of sectarian violence in the province.
The agreement paved the way for a Protestant Catholic power sharing assembly that was suspended more than two years ago amid a crisis of confidence and allegations of IRA espionage.
British and Irish efforts to revive power sharing and secure a permanent settlement collapsed before Christmas after Sinn Fein rejected Protestant demands for photographic proof of weapons destruction.
A Roman Catholic priest appealed Saturday to the Irish Republican Army to reveal the burial spots of more than a dozen people whose bodies have never been found.
The Rev. Sean Dooley made his plea at the funeral of Gareth O'Connor, 24, an IRA dissident who disappeared in May 2003.
Last weekend, police divers found his body still inside his car in a canal in Newry, 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of Belfast.
Police and O'Connor's family say IRA members killed him, probably because he had been arguing with an IRA member over a money raising racket the IRA was running in South Armagh, a major power base for the outlawed group.
The IRA has denied involvement.
At the time of his disappearance, O'Connor had been driving towards a police station to report for bail in the neighboring Republic of Ireland, where he was facing trial for membership in a splinter group called the Real IRA.
Dooley said the O'Connor family's "worst has come to the worst," but the relatives of others slain by the IRA had not been allowed to lay their loved ones to rest.
"I appeal to anybody who has any information about the disappeared to contact their families directly or indirectly so that other bodies may be cut down from the crosses and given Christian burials," Dooley told several hundred mourners at O'Connor's funeral Mass in St. Patrick's Cathedral in Newry.
In a direct plea to those who killed more than a dozen IRA victims, mostly in the 1970s and early 1980s, he asked, "How can you go home to your families every night knowing the hell these families are enduring?"
The search for unmarked graves of IRA victims is one of many unfinished chapters of Northern Ireland's peace process.
The IRA in 1999 described the locations of eight burial spots to a joint British Irish commission coordinating the search, but remains of only three IRA victims have been found.
The group has rejected responsibility for several other long missing people abducted from IRA power bases in the 1970s.
The IRA killed about 1800 people from 1970 to 1997, when it called an open ended truce.
Despite this, IRA members continue to administer crippling beatings and occasionally fatal shootings and stabbings to their criminal opponents in Catholic areas.
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met Wednesday with British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Hain and reaffirmed support for the implementation of the Good Friday accords.
The 1998 Good Friday peace deal largely ended three decades of intercommunity violence in Northern Ireland and established a power sharing executive and assembly.
"The United States continues to support fully the British and Irish governments' efforts to implement the Good Friday Accords," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said.
The United States, he said, welcomed statements made this week by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern that the key to moving forward was for the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Northern Ireland's main Catholic paramilitary group, to end all violence unequivocally.
Blair and Ahern underlined their desire for the quick return of a self governing Northern Ireland and urged the IRA to cooperate.
They warned that such a government would only be achieved provided that peace prevailed in the British ruled province.
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern admitted on Tuesday that he had held a series of private one on one meetings on the Northern Ireland peace process with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, but denied they had been secret in any way.
Answering questions in parliament, Ahern told MPs that the meetings with Adams, whose party is the political wing of the IRA, Northern Ireland's main Catholic paramilitary group, had merely been to maintain dialogue.
He said there had been "possibly three or four meetings" with Adams since March.
"On balance, these meetings at this particular time were better conducted outside the glare of publicity," Ahern said.
In April, Adams appealed to the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to end violence and fully embrace democratic means.
Ahern said he explained to Adams the clear position required by the Irish government before negotiations could resume on restoring the power sharing political institutions in British ruled Northern Ireland.
These included a total end to IRA paramilitarism and related criminality and full decommissioning of the IRA's arms and explosives arsenals.
"It is only on that basis that we can move forward," Ahern said.
Ahern is to meet his British counterpart Tony Blair in London on Wednesday.
He will also be holding talks with Ian Paisley, leader of Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant political group, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
Ahern stressed to MPs that Northern Ireland was entering the summer season of Protestant loyalist Orange Order marches, that traditionally cause tensions between Catholics and Protestants.
Hopes are rising in Northern Ireland that the IRA will, by the end of this month, announce a plan for a complete and swift process of disarmament.
A deal on the so called "decommissioning" of IRA weapons was almost reached at the end of last year, but foundered on demands from the DUP that the process by verified through photographs.
Northern Ireland has seen a virtual end to more than 30 years of violence since the landmark 1998 Good Friday peace deal, but Dublin and London, as well as an independent monitoring body, have accused paramilitary groups of continued criminal activities.
Any public pledge by the Irish Republican Army to cease all activities, including crime, should be weighed over time to test whether it's genuine, the British governor of Northern Ireland said Tuesday.
Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain said the government was soon expecting the IRA to issue a new peace declaration that would address a long standing demand for the outlawed group to disarm fully and disband.
He said until the IRA did this, Protestant leaders would refuse to share power with Sinn Fein, the IRA linked party that represents most Catholics.
"For that trust to be restored there must be a clear, definitive and permanent end to paramilitary activity and its associated criminality," Hain said in a speech to the annual conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.
"Words are not enough, but they are an important start, and I hope people would not underestimate the significance of a credible statement from the IRA," he said.
But in a nod to Protestant leaders' unwillingness to form a power sharing government immediately with Sinn Fein, Hain said an unspecified delay would be reasonable to determine whether the IRA was telling the truth.
"A commitment in words needs to be capable of being verified over a period of time so that everyone can see that the commitment is real and lasting," he said.
Northern Ireland's peace process would receive a major boost if the Irish Republican Army responds positively to appeals to embrace political methods, a leading figure in the paramilitary group's political wing said Friday.
"It would give much needed new momentum to the peace process," Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin McGuinness told a summer school in the Irish Republic.
"It is clear that a positive response from the IRA would have an immediate and enormous impact on the political situation."
In April, Since Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams made a direct appeal to IRA "volunteers" to give up all violence and adopt democratic methods, since then the Catholic paramilitary group has been holding meetings to discuss a response.
"I fully support Gerry Adams' appeal and I sincerely hope that the IRA does respond to it positively," McGuinness said.
The Irish and British governments hope for an answer before the August holiday period from the IRA, which declared a ceasefire in its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland ahead of a 1998 Good Friday peace deal which largely ended 30 years of violence.
McGuinness claimed a positive response would deal with the "genuine concerns" of Protestant unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of Britain, and remove any excuse for unionist party leaders refusing to negotiate directly with Sinn Fein.
He said it would also put "enormous pressure" on Northern Ireland's largest party, the hardline Democratic Unionist Party led by Ian Paisley, "to come on board the peace process" for the first time.
"There is no alternative to sharing power with Irish republicans, there is no alterative to the all Ireland architecture and the equality agenda of the Good Friday Agreement," McGuinness said.
Protestant factions in Northern Ireland are adamant that there can be no political progress toward a lasting peace settlement without a move by the IRA to end all paramilitary and criminal activity and a decommissioning of its weapons arsenals.
The 1998 peace deal paved the way for a Protestant Catholic power sharing assembly, but that was suspended more than two years ago amid allegations of IRA espionage.
British and Irish efforts to revive power sharing and secure a permanent settlement collapsed before Christmas after Sinn Fein rejected Protestant demands for photographic proof of IRA weapons destruction.
In an unusual show of agreement, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and the Rev. Ian Paisley, the top Protestant politician in Northern Ireland, called Wednesday for the outlawed IRA to disarm and disband.
Ahern and Paisley a hard liner who opposes Irish involvement in Northern Ireland and didn't begin meeting Ahern until last year spoke separately after a 90 minute meeting at the Irish embassy in London.
They said the Irish Republican Army was standing in the way of revived Catholic Protestant cooperation in Northern Ireland.
Both emphasized that the IRA must demonstrate its voluntary demise in concrete ways.
Ahern said he was hopeful that the IRA would issue a declaration within the next few months spelling out whether it will disarm and cease all threatening activities.
"To move forward, we need a clear, unambiguous end of all paramilitary and criminal activity and we need to see the completion of (weapons) decommissioning," Ahern said.
But he stressed, "It is not just words, it is deeds.
If we get a statement on the issues I have mentioned, we would be very happy with the statement.
But we would, naturally enough, want to see that they happen."
Northern Ireland's Good Friday peace accord of 1998 proposed the creation of a joint Catholic Protestant administration involving Sinn Fein, the IRA linked party that represents most of the province's Catholics.
Power sharing collapsed in 2002 following chronic arguments over IRA activities and weaponry.
Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party, which represents most of the territory's British Protestant majority, says it won't cooperate with Sinn Fein unless the IRA backs up words with meaningful public action particularly the publication of photos of its disarmament.
The IRA rejected those terms in December and since has been implicated in a string of criminal scandals, including a world record bank robbery, the knife slaying of a Catholic man and a money laundering network.
Paisley emphasized Wednesday he would wait for at least six months following an IRA peace declaration to see whether the group followed through with deeds.
The IRA was supposed to have scrapped all of its stockpiled weapons by mid 2000 in support of the Good Friday deal.
Instead it began a secrecy shrouded process in October 2001 and halted it in October 2003 still in possession of much of its arsenal.
"Everybody has their tongue out waiting for a statement from the IRA.
We haven't got our tongues out,We are looking for action," Paisley said.
Ahern was also meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has worked closely with Ahern since 1997 to broker compromise in Northern Ireland, which is a part of the United Kingdom.
Three senior Sinn Fein leaders, including party president Gerry Adams, have stepped down from their posts on the ruling body of the party's Irish Republican Army military wing according to the Irish Independent newspaper on Saturday.
The newspaper said Adams, chief negotiator Martin McGuinness and convicted gun runner Martin Ferris who is an lawmaker in the Irish Republic's parliament have all resigned from the seven man army council of the Catholic IRA paramilitary group.
It says their posts have been filled by three men from Northern Ireland who are closely aligned to the Adams McGuinness group pushing the movement onto a purely political path.
The newspaper says none of the new appointees is a member of Sinn Fein but all are regarded within the Provisional republican movement as militarists with proven records.
"The ground breaking decision means that all links between the leadership of the political and military wings of the Provisional movement have been severed.
"The changes in personnel are also seen as part of the "sanitisation" process within Sinn Fein as the party prepares to present itself as a democratic body that is ready to play a full part in political developments north and south of the border," the Independent says.
In an unprecedented charge in January, Irish Justice Minister Michael McDowell claimed the three Sinn Fein men were leaders of both the political and military wings of the republican movement.
However, in a joint statement the trio "categorically" denied they were members of the ruling body of the outlawed IRA and accused McDowell of abusing his office.
The Independent says that in the wake of the London bombings, and with an increasingly hostile climate towards terrorist violence, the Provisional movement is understood to have decided that this is the right time to move into a new mode.
Earlier this year, Adams has made a direct appeal to IRA "volunteers" to embrace purely political and democratic activity.
The Irish and British governments hope for a response before the August holiday period from the IRA, which declared a ceasefire in its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland before a 1998 peace deal which largely ended 30 years of violence.
Protestant factions in Northern Ireland are adamant that there can be no political progress toward a lasting peace settlement without a move by the IRA to end all paramilitary and criminal activity and a decommissioning of weapons arsenals.

British and Irish efforts to revive power sharing and secure a permanent settlement collapsed before Christmas after Sinn Fein rejected Protestant demands for photographic proof of IRA weapons destruction.
At a music filled memorial at Carnegie Hall, ABC News anchor Peter Jennings was remembered Tuesday as a journalist with a childlike awe of the world, a devoted father and loyal Canadian who always carried a copy of the U.S. Constitution.
A picture of a smiling Jennings, the sun in his face and blue skies behind him, was projected over the stage of the New York landmark.
The audience of about 2000 people was filled with luminaries: Mike Wallace, Brian Williams, Dan Rather, Tom Wolfe, Larry King, Jon Stewart, Charles Gibson, Al Sharpton, Alan Alda, George Stephanopoulos, Bob Schieffer, Michael Eisner, Elizabeth Vargas and her husband Marc Cohn.
"An anchor is what keeps a ship from drifting into dangerous waters," said ABC News President David Westin.
"It keeps us steady and secure during the night, and that's what Peter was to ABC News."
When they joined the network four decades ago, Ted Koppel recalled how he was known as the smart one and Jennings the handsome one.
Jennings who died of lung cancer Aug 7 kept his looks to the end but was also "very, very smart," he said.
"From the time I first met Peter 41 years ago until our last meeting a few weeks ago, I felt a thrill whenever I saw him," the "Nightline" host said.
"Not that many people have that charisma, that kind of animal magnetism that makes it difficult to focus on anybody else in the room."
Jennings, ABC's chief news anchor for more than 20 years, was also "famously attracted to women," Koppel said.
"Even so, he only married four of them."
A handful of homeless people were also in the hall.
Jennings' widow, Kayce, was startled recently when a homeless man approached to express sympathy for her loss, Jennings had befriended him during walks in Central Park.
Jennings frequently served meals to the homeless after leaving the ABC News studio and its evening broadcast of "World News Tonight," said Mary Brosnahan Sullivan of the Coalition for the Homeless.
"The Peter I knew was somebody of concrete action," she said.
Personal remembrances were interspersed with music a gospel choir, violinist Natalie MacMaster, cellist Yo Yo Ma, singer Alison Krauss and a jazz combo featuring Wynton Marsalis.
Jennings was an insatiable jazz fan.
"For Peter, jazz was more than just a form of music, it was a way of looking at life," Westin said.
A hopeless sentimentalist, Jennings was "the only person I knew who got weepy telling about his service on jury duty," ABC producer Tom Nagorski said.
Alan Alda recalled Jennings as "complex and simple at the same time, knowledgeable and inquisitive, kind and tough at the same time, gracious and direct."
He never left a social engagement without Jennings giving him a book, the last was a copy of the Constitution, he said.
Jennings never lost his Canadian identity an honor guard from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police marched at the service but was proud also to become a U.S. citizen a few years before he died.
Since his death many of his ABC News colleagues have worn bracelets saying "what would Peter do?"
For all the professional colleagues and anecdotes at the memorial, the pictures projected onstage showed an off camera Jennings on family outings.
Friends said his two children, Chris and Elizabeth, were his proudest accomplishments.
They were also the last to speak at the nearly two hour remembrance.
"There is no way to express how much I miss my father," his son said.
"Each day is, above all else, a day without him."
ABC News anchor Peter Jennings died of lung cancer at the age of 67 on Sunday, his company said.
The Canadian born broadcaster who delivered the news to Americans each night in five separate decades died at his New York home, said ABC News President David Westin late Sunday.
Jennings announced in April that he had lung cancer and would begin treatment.
Although he occasionally came to the office after his diagnosis, he never again appeared on the air.
Jennings anchored ABC's World News Tonight for more than 20 years.
Jennings, the face of the ABC News, logged more than 60 hours on the air during the week of the terrorist attacks in the United States on Sept 11, 2001.
Peter Jennings, the urbane anchorman of ABC's evening newscast for the past 22 years, died Sunday, it was announced by his network.
He was 67.
It was reported that he had died at his home in New York.
Jennings had not been on the air since April 5 when he revealed he had lung cancer.
He had been conspicuously absent from the coverage of Pope John Paul II's funeral in Rome.
A smoker until about 20 years ago, he said he relapsed under the pressure of Sept 11, 2001 but later quit again.
The Canadian born Jennings was a familiar face in millions of households for more than 40 years.
His well rounded tones, world savvy air and matter of fact delivery led "World News Tonight" to the top of the ratings for 11 of the past 20 years, even as all the networks lost huge numbers of viewers to cable television, to the Internet and to the longer workdays and busier lives of those who used to watch the news over the family dinner.
Jennings ranged the world as a reporter and anchorman, specializing in the Middle East long before many domestic viewers knew much more about the region than the location of Jerusalem and the movie "Lawrence of Arabia."
He was at the Summer Olympic Games in Munich Sept 5, 1972 when Arab terrorists seized and killed Israeli athletes.
Familiar with the history and goals of the Black September terrorist group, Jennings filed a series of reports, and moved his camera crew close enough to get clear pictures of the terrorists, which "displayed considerable moxie," wrote Barbara Matusow in "The Evening Stars: The Making of the Network News Anchor."
She called it "among the most gripping episodes ever shown on live television."
Twenty nine years later, Jennings was on the air within minutes after two airliners crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept 11, 2001, and stayed on the air for more than 12 consecutive hours, and for 60 hours that first week, ABC News said in its biography of the anchor.
His steadiness and "Herculean" work during that period was widely praised.
"We watched Peter Jennings' beard grow, and we were somehow reassured that he did not shave, that through morning, afternoon, evening and on into the night, he did not leave the desk, that he confided in us his uncertainties, that he shared the confusions of each hour," Washington Post columnist Marc Fisher wrote.
"He grew more pale and more vulnerable, as if he knew that we needed him to be human, so that we could be together."
During that devastating day, as all activity stopped and Americans remained glued to their televisions, Jennings' trademark cool warmed as he faltered just a bit.
"We do not very often make recommendations for people's behavior from this chair," he told viewers, "but as (one ABC News correspondent) was talking, I checked in with my children, and it who were deeply stressed, as I think young people are across the United States.
So, if you're a parent, you've got a kid" he paused and smiled awkwardly "in some other part of the country, call them up.
Exchange observations."
He became a citizen of the United States in 2003, 39 years after he left Canada.
"There's no explaining the timing," he told USA Today.
"Did 9/11 make a difference?
Yes, it did make a difference.
Did working on (his book) 'In Search of America' for the last several years, which kept me on the road a lot and dealing with both contemporary and historic national issues about which I felt very deeply?
That made a difference."
His death marked a year in which the evening anchors of all three major broadcast networks left the anchor's chair.
NBC's Tom Brokaw retired in December 2004, and CBS' Dan Rather stepped down from the anchor's job in March 2005.
Born in Toronto, the son of pioneering Canadian broadcaster Charles Jennings, an 11 year old Peter Jennings first broadcast "Peter's People," a radio show for children.
He dropped out of high school, worked briefly in a bank and then entered broadcasting.
He became a radio news reporter in Brockton, Ontario and worked briefly for the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. before switching to co anchor CTV National News at Canada's first privately owned network in 1962.
While covering the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, Jennings attracted the attention of the then president of ABC, Elmer W. Lower, who offered him a job.
Jennings turned it down but three months later reconsidered.
Based in New York City, he was immediately seen as a rising star.
A year later, at age 26, he was named co anchor and then sole anchor of ABC Evening News' 15 minute broadcast.
His inexperience showed, especially in comparison to veteran competitors Walter Cronkite at CBS and Chet Huntley and David Brinkley on NBC.
Widely derided as a "glamorcaster" and "anchorboy," Jennings was ridiculed for his Anglicized diction and ignorance of American history and culture.
After three years, he returned to the ranks of domestic news correspondents.
He was sent to the Middle East in 1969 to establish the first American television news bureau in the Arab world, and there he found his niche.
For seven years, based in Beirut, he traveled to virtually every Arab country and built a store of knowledge he would draw upon for years.
His reporting during the 1973 Israeli Arab war earned the respect of viewers.
He conducted the first television interview with Palestine Liberation Organization's Yasser Arafat, and his 1974 profile of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat won his first George Foster Peabody award.
He was the first U.S. reporter to interview the Iranian Ayatollah Khomeini, then in exile in Paris.
Jennings returned to the U.S. in 1975 as Washington correspondent and news reader for the predecessor to Good Morning America.
After 10 months, he was reassigned overseas as chief foreign correspondent, based in London.
ABC executive Roone Arledge then created a three anchor broadcast, with Frank Reynolds in Washington, Max Robinson in Chicago and Jennings in London.
In 1983, after Reynolds died of cancer, Jennings was called back to the U.S. to retrieve his role as ABC's sole anchorman.
His years at the helm were not without glitches.
He, along with the other major networks, prematurely and erroneously reported that Democratic nominee Al Gore won Florida in the 2000 presidential election.
Jennings was frequently accused of liberal bias by conservative media watchdog organizations, and pro Palestinian bias by Israeli partisans.
A 2004 commentary in a journalism trade magazine, the Columbia Journalism Review, dismissed criticism that ABC's newscast was "anti war," noting that "despite the pressure to be a cheerleader, World News Tonight with Peter Jennings was more probing during the war than its rivals.
The center's anti war label is looking like ABC's red badge of courage."
Washington Post television critic Tom Shales, who is no fan of Jennings, in 1994 praised his special on the Bosnian war, writing, "You have to hand it to Peter Jennings.
He has managed to maintain his dignity and his stature even as network news has grown increasingly tabloidian all around him.
He has stayed above the fray, and as frays go, this one is particularly unsavory,It isn't lurid or sexy and it probably won't get big ratings, but it's the kind of thing a network news division ought to be doing just for the sake of doing it,It could easily be argued that CBS News remembers (Edward R.) Murrow in words, whereas ABC News remembers him in deeds deeds like tonight's Jennings report."
Five times he was named the country's best anchorman in a poll of readers of another trade magazine, Washington Journalism Review.
He won Harvard University's Goldsmith Career Award for excellence in journalism and the Radio and Television News Directors Paul White Award, chosen by the news directors of all three major networks.
"World News Tonight" was honored with the Edward R. Murrow award for best national newscast in 2004.
He won 14 national Emmys, two George Foster Peabody awards, several Overseas Press Club awards and several Alfred I duPont Columbia University Awards for journalism.
In addition to anchoring, he covered issues in depth on hour long primetime specials, called "Peter Jennings Reporting."
Begun in 1990, the show ranged from historic issues such as the Kennedy assassination to religious controversies to the crisis in arts funding to a chronicle of the bombers of Oklahoma City, as well as international crises.
He anchored live news specials for children, and co wrote "The Century" (1998) with Todd Brewster, which later became a 12 hour ABC series.
He and Brewster also collaborated on "In Search of America" (2002).
His marriages to Valerie Godsoe, Annie Malouf and Kati Marton ended in divorce.
Survivors include his wife, Kayce Freed of New York City, and two children from his third marriage, Elizabeth and Christopher.
Peter Jennings' untimely death Sunday put a period to the era in which network anchors derived their "authority" from journalistic experience, as well as on camera presence.
If television viewers are unlikely to see his equal again, it has less to do with Jennings' unique personal qualities formidable as they were than with the melancholy state of the three broadcast networks' news operations.
Years of shortsighted and unremitting cost cutting by their corporate proprietors have made them shells of what they once were.
Among the network and cable news divisions, only CNN maintains anything like a full service foreign reporting operation, increasingly, even the others' commitment to comprehensive domestic coverage is withering.
So if ABC wanted to cultivate another Jennings someone with a sophisticated reportorial background and an engaging broadcast persona it simply lacks the organizational ability to do it.
In 1965, for example, when the then 26 year old Jennings had a disastrous first go at anchoring ABC's nightly newscast, he described himself as "simply unqualified."
To remedy that, he spent more than a decade reporting from ABC bureaus in the Middle East and Europe.
By the time he was named as one of three co anchors of the network's "World News Tonight" in 1978, he was ABC's chief foreign correspondent.
Can anybody name the person who occupies that assignment today?
Perhaps more important, can anyone imagine one of the current crop of television news "personalities" admitting he or she is unqualified to do anything from brain surgery to stand up comedy?
Although wealth and celebrity came with his anchorman's chair, Jennings never lost his field reporter's legs.
It seems a commonplace observation to make, but constantly gathering facts and, then, thinking about them in some systematic way is what prepares journalists to respond intelligently to the demands of breaking news.
Most recently, many Americans saw Jennings do just that in the more than 60 hours of sober and reflective broadcasting he did in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 atrocities.
Monday, his former colleague Barbara Walters was among those who singled out Jennings' nearly unmatched ability to ad lib smartly and often eloquently while covering developing stories.
Canadian news anchor Lloyd Robertson said that "Peter brought a high quality of literature to electronic journalism.
There was nobody who could put things together on the air as easily and as rapidly as he did."
(Begin optional trim) Part of that was mental agility, part unremitting attention to his work.
During the mid 1990s, my wife, Leslie Abramson, was a legal analyst for ABC News.
While on business in New York, she ran into Jennings, who invited her to join a group of network executives and broadcasters that night at the Committee to Protect Journalists' annual dinner.
During the course of the essentially ceremonial evening with its introductions and speeches, Leslie noticed Jennings repeatedly reaching into an inside coat pocket for a small, bound notebook in which he made notations.
"Are you taking notes on this?" she asked.
"No," Jennings replied.
"I write down thoughts as they occur to me.
You never know when you're going to need a good idea."
(End optional trim) Relentless and inquisitive preparation was one thing that distinguished Jennings' journalism, but so did a perspective that actually was quite singular.
The cool, engaged but somewhat apart persona that Jennings brought to his on screen work was as much as matter of intellect as temperament.
Jennings the journalist was quintessentially a man of the middle distance.
Some of that may have been attributable to his Canadian origins.
U.S. attitudes toward the rest of the world tend to oscillate between hysterical triumphalism and lacerating self loathing.
Around both poles, what tends to be lost is the fact that there are other people in the world, who live their own lives and act for reasons of their own.
As a physically vast nation with a tiny population, most of which lives hard up against the United States, Canadians tend to approach other people and countries with a wry combination of self deprecation and self assertion.
Those qualities were one of the things that made Jennings a superb foreign correspondent.
Shortly after 9/11, Jennings became a naturalized American, though he retained his Canadian citizenship.
In an interview with the Canadian Press at the time, he explained his decision: "I am a Canadian.
My mother, like many of her generation, always found a reason to resent the United States and defined herself as a Canadian by being not American."
In the wake of the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, however, Jennings experienced his connection to other Americans in an urgent new way.
"I felt more attached to them than I perhaps had anticipated in emotional terms," he said.
"This is my home."
As television news increasingly trades on attitude and entertainment rather than reporting and analysis, one of the things that will be missed most about Jennings and his work is the respect he showed for American viewers.
Without intending to, he once summed that quality up in an interview with the Toronto Star: "There are a lot of people in this business who believe that part of our job is to reassure the public every night," Jennings said.
"I subscribe to leaving people with essentially a rough draft of history.
Some days it is reassuring.
Some days, it is absolutely destructive."
One of the tragedies of our time is that the corporate time servers who now direct the course of broadcast journalism do not share Peter Jennings' faith that American viewers are entitled to that respect.
Peter Jennings, a high school dropout from Canada who transformed himself into one of the most urbane, well traveled and recognizable journalists on American television, died Sunday.
He was 67 and lived in Manhattan.
The cause of death was lung cancer, said Charles Gibson, who announced the death of his colleague on television in a special report just after 11:30 p.m.
Jennings had disclosed that he was suffering from lung cancer on April 5, first in a written statement released by ABC and later that night on "World News Tonight," the evening news broadcast that he had led since September 1983.
In brief remarks at the end of that night's program, Jennings, his voice scratchy, told viewers that he hoped to return to the anchor desk as his health and strength permitted.
But he never did.
It was a jarring departure for someone who for so long had been such a visible fixture in so many American homes each night.
Along with the two other pillars of the so called "Big 3" Tom Brokaw of NBC and Dan Rather of CBS Jennings had, in the early 1980s, ushered in the era of the television news anchor as lavishly compensated, globe trotting superstar.
After the departure of Brokaw from his anchor chair in December, followed by Rather's retirement from the evening news in March, Jennings' death brings that era to a close.
For more than two decades, the magnitude of a news event could be measured, at least in part, by whether Jennings and his counterparts on the other two networks showed up on the scene.
Indeed, they logged so many miles over so many years in so many trench coats and flak jackets that they effectively acted as bookends on some of the biggest running stories of modern times.
Jennings' official ABC biography notes, for example, that as a foreign correspondent, he was "in Berlin in the 1960s when the Berlin Wall was going up," and there again, as an anchor, "in the 1990s when it came down."
Similarly, he was on the ground in Gdansk, Poland, for the birth of the Solidarity labor and political movement, and later for the overthrow of the country's communist government.
In addition to every major world capital and war zone, Jennings also reported from all 50 states, according to the network.
He seemed to draw on that collective experience as well as his practiced ability to calmly describe events as they unfolded live not long after two hijacked planes struck the World Trade Center on Sept 11, 2001.
Over the course of that day, and those that immediately followed, he would spend more than 60 hours on the air in what Tom Shales of The Washington Post, among other critics, praised as a tour de force of interviewing and explanatory broadcast journalism laced with undisguised bewilderment.
"This is what it looked like moments ago," Jennings said at one point that first morning, as he introduced a piece of videotape recorded moments earlier in Lower Manhattan.
"My God!
The southern tower, 10:00 Eastern time this morning, just collapsing on itself.
This is a place where thousands of people worked.
We have no idea what caused this."
The coverage of all three broadcast networks that week underscored a maxim of the television news business: that however much the audience of the evening news programs may have eroded in recent years, viewers usually return during moments of crisis.
At the peak of his broadcast's popularity, in the 1992 93 television season, Jennings drew an average audience of nearly 14 million people each night, according to Nielsen Media Research.
He reached that milestone midway through an eight year ratings winning streak, during which his audience sometimes exceeded those of both Brokaw and Rather by 2 million or more viewers.
(For nearly a decade since, to his periodic frustration, his broadcast had lagged behind that of NBC's, even after Brokaw yielded to Brian Williams in December.)
Though the audience for the evening news has fallen precipitously in recent years a casualty of changes in people's schedules and the competition offered by the cable news networks and the Internet Jennings' broadcast (and those on CBS and NBC) still drew a combined audience of more than 25 million viewers this past year.
And however much his audience had aged the median age of a Jennings viewer this past season was about 60, according to Nielsen advertisers still spend in excess of $100 million annually on each of the evening news programs.
Like Brokaw, Rather and now Williams, Jennings was well paid for his efforts: he earned an estimated $10 million a year in recent years.
His most recent contract with the network was due to expire later this year, but at least until he took ill, the network was preparing to extend Jennings' time in the anchor chair for "several years to come," according to David Westin, president of ABC News.
Jennings' broadcast training had begun at an astonishingly young age, a function at least partly of his pedigree.
Peter Charles Jennings was born July 29, 1938, in Toronto.
His father, Charles, was a senior executive of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and a pioneer in Canadian radio news.
In "The Century" (Doubleday, 1998), one of two coffee table worthy history books that he cowrote with Todd Brewster, Jennings recalled an early exercise that his father put him through in an effort to sharpen his powers of observation.
"Describe the sky," his father had said.
After the young boy had done so, his father dispatched him outside again.
"Now, go out and slice it into pieces and describe each piece as different from the next."
By age 9, he had his own show on Canadian radio, "Peter's Program."
He dropped out of high school at 17, and by his early 20s was the host of a dance show similar to "American Bandstand" called "Club Thirteen."
His rise to the pinnacle of Canadian television news, and later its far larger counterpart to the south, was swift.
In 1962, at age 24, he was named co anchor of the national newscast on CTV, a competitor of his father's network, a job that he held until 1964.
That year, he moved to the United States to begin work as a correspondent for ABC.
Barely a year later, the network named him an anchor of "ABC Evening News," then a 15 minute newscast, which put him at age 26 head to head with Walter Cronkite on CBS and the formidable tandem of Chet Huntley and David Brinkley on NBC.
Though he would serve ABC in that capacity for nearly three years, Jennings said in an interview last year that he was ill suited for the job and unhappy in it.
"I had the good sense to quit," he said.
What followed was more than a decade of postings abroad as a foreign correspondent for ABC, during which, Jennings said last year, he got an on the job introduction to the world with a tuition bill effectively footed by his employer.
"I have no formal education to speak of," Jennings said.
"ABC has been my education and provided my education.
ABC has enabled me to work everywhere in the world and has ended up paying me beyond handsomely."
From 1968 to 1978, Jennings traveled extensively, including to Vietnam, Munich, Germany (where he covered the hostage taking at the 1972 Summer Olympics), and Beirut, Lebanon (where he established the network's first news bureau in the Arab world.)
In 1978, he began his second tour as an anchor for the network, serving as one of three hosts of "World News Tonight," along with Frank Reynolds and Max Robinson, in a format devised by Roone Arledge, the legendary sports programmer who had added the news division to his portfolio.
Jennings was the program's foreign anchor, and reported from London until 1983.
Three weeks after Reynolds died following a battle with bone cancer, Jennings was named the sole anchor (and managing editor) of the broadcast, titles that Mr Jennings continued to hold at his death.
As an anchor, Jennings presented himself as a worldly alternative to Brokaw's plain spoken Midwestern manner and Mr Rather's folksy, if at times offbeat, Southern charm.
He neither spoke like many of his viewers ("about" came out of his mouth as a BOOT, a remnant of his Canadian roots) nor looked like them, with a matinee idol face and crisply tailored wardrobe that were frequently likened in print to those of James Bond.
Though his bearing could be stiff on the air (and his syntax so simplistic at times as to border on patronizing), Jennings was immensely popular with his audience.
During a trip last fall through Kansas, Pennsylvania and Ohio in the weeks before the presidential election, he traveled at times aboard a coach customized by the news division to trumpet its campaign coverage and frequently received a rock star's welcome when he decamped.
For example, in the parking lot of a deli just outside of Pittsburgh, where he had come to interview a long shot candidate for Congress whose threadbare headquarters was upstairs, Jennings found himself on the receiving end of several hugs from loyal viewers.
"He's so handsome," one of those viewers, Vilma Berryman, 66, the deli owner, observed immediately after meeting him.
"He's taller than I thought.
He speaks so softly."
Like all of the Big 3, Jennings was not without his detractors.
Among his critics were those who contended he was too soft on the air when describing the Palestinian cause or the regime of the Cuban leader Fidel Castro accusations he disputed.
Similarly, an article published in July 2004 in the National Review portrayed him as a thinly veiled opponent of the American war in Iraq.
The article quoted Jennings as saying: "That is simply not the way I think of this role.
This role is designed to question the behavior of government officials on behalf of the public."
Jennings was conscious of having been imbued, during his Canadian boyhood, with a skepticism about American behavior, at least partly as a result, he often delighted in presenting the opinions of those in the minority, whatever the situation.
And yet, he simultaneously carried on an elaborate love affair with America, one that reached its apex in the summer of 2003, when he announced that he had become an American citizen, scoring, he said proudly, 100 percent on his citizenship test.
In a toast around that time that he gave at the new National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, he described his adopted home as "this brash and noble container of dreams, this muse to artists and inventors and entrepreneurs, this beacon of optimism, this dynamo of energy, this trumpet blare of liberty."
Jennings' personal life was at times grist for the gossip pages, including his three divorces.
His third wife, the author Kati Marton, whom he married in 1979 and divorced in 1993, is the mother of his two children, who survive him.
They are a daughter, Elizabeth, and son, Christopher.
He is also survived by his fourth wife, Kayce Freed, a former ABC television producer whom he married in December 1997.
Having prided himself on rarely taking a sick day in nearly 40 years and being dismissive, at times, of those high paid colleagues who did Jennings had missed the broadcast and the newsroom terribly in recent months.
In a letter posted on April 29 on the ABC news Web site, excerpts of which were read on that night's evening news, Jennings described how treatments for his cancer had proven more debilitating than he had anticipated.
"Yesterday I decided to go to the office," he wrote.
"I live only a few blocks away.
I got as far as the door.
Chemo strikes."
"Do I detect a knowing but sympathetic smile on many of your faces?" he added.
About a month later, Jennings did make a rare visit to the ABC News headquarters on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
With a gray sweater draped over his shoulders, and his feet clad in thick wool socks and moccasins, Jennings held court for about a half hour late one morning from his desk, in what is known as "the rim," a newsroom one floor below the "World News Tonight" studio.
His voice soft and his body as much as 20 pounds lighter than usual, Jennings told several dozen staff members who had gathered around his desk about the doctors and other patients he had been meeting and of a first time radiation treatment that he had just received, according to one veteran correspondent who did not wish to be identified so as not to offend Jennings' family.
Jennings brought himself and many of his colleagues to tears when he turned to Charles Gibson, one of his two principal substitutes on the program, and thanked him for closing each night's broadcast with the phrase, "for Peter Jennings and all of us at ABC News."
Jennings then put his hand over his heart and said, "That means so much to me," according to his colleague.
But whatever maudlin feelings were in the air quickly evaporated, Jennings' longtime colleague recounted, when the anchor brandished a familiar black calligraphy pen and began marking up the rundown for that night's broadcast.
"No, that's not a good one," he could be overheard telling Jonathan Banner, the program's executive producer, about one segment.
Of another, he added, "You want to move this higher up."
For his closest colleagues, the reassuring sight of the anchor as editor provided a fleeting moment of normalcy in what had been a disorienting and heartbreaking few months.
Anchor Peter Jennings' death was met Monday with a cascade of sorrowful appreciations from national leaders, colleagues and viewers around the country as anguished ABC employees struggled to absorb the impact of his loss on the network.
Jennings who died at home in New York on Sunday night four months after he was diagnosed with lung cancer was hailed as a fiercely determined newsman who infused his broadcasts with a sophisticated sensibility honed by years as a foreign correspondent.
Often demanding, he occasionally frustrated co workers with his relentless probing, an approach many credit with raising the standards of ABC News.
He was lauded by everyone from President Bush who called him "a part of the life of a lot of our fellow citizens" to more than 25000 viewers who posted messages on the ABC News Web site expressing their grief at his death.
"One word describes Peter Jennings on air: Class," wrote one.
"He shall be missed."
With his death, retired NBC anchor Tom Brokaw said that he felt "as if I've lost a member of my family," while former CBS anchor Dan Rather praised Jennings as "one of the most talented, caring and successful electronic journalists of all time."
The debonair Jennings anchored "World News Tonight" for the last 22 years, half of his four decades long career at ABC.
As managing editor of the evening broadcast, he oversaw each story that went on the air, personally editing nearly every story script.
"In many respects, Peter is the news division," said Paul Slavin, senior vice president of worldwide newsgathering for ABC News.
"There was never a decision that was made without considering what Peter thought about it,He was, in a way, the persistent conscience."
Jennings' death forces ABC to confront a similar challenge that NBC and CBS have faced in the last year: settling on a successor for an established anchor.
Brokaw's handoff of the "NBC Nightly News" to Brian Williams in December was long planned and widely praised as a seamless transition.
CBS has tapped veteran Washington correspondent Bob Schieffer to temporarily replace Rather, who left the anchor desk in March, while the network mulls over a new format for its broadcast.
ABC executives said Monday that no decisions have yet been made about who will take over for Jennings.
For now, "Good Morning America" co host Charles Gibson and "20/20" co anchor Elizabeth Vargas will continue to anchor "World News Tonight" on a temporary basis.
Network officials had hoped that the changes at the other networks this year would give Jennings a chance to regain the title of the top rated evening newscast, a position he held from the mid 1980s to mid 1990s.
But after the anchor, a longtime smoker, learned he was fighting lung cancer in April, he immediately began chemotherapy.
"He has left us with a phenomenal foundation, and it is a foundation that we will move forward with," Slavin said.
"The corporeal part of Peter may not be here, but his thoughts and his ideas, his demands for excellence and his heart will stay here."
As an exacting editor, Jennings pushed himself and those around him relentlessly, often asking correspondents to repeatedly rewrite their story scripts.
"He drove everyone very hard, including and perhaps especially, himself," said congressional correspondent Linda Douglass.
"He involved himself in every detail of our news coverage, from deciding which stories were covered to how they were covered to how the stories were written.
At ABC News, it felt as though he was in our bloodstream."
Paul Friedman, a longtime executive producer of "World News Tonight," said Jennings had an "insatiable curiosity."
"He was a perfectionist, which made him terrific to work with in the sense that it was challenging all the time, and occasionally difficult," Friedman said.
(Begin optional trim) Jennings' drive was rooted partly in his embarrassment that he never completed high school or college, according to friends and former colleagues.
Wherever he traveled for stories which was often the anchor brought with him a suitcase full of books to read.
"He felt he had to prove himself," said CNN Washington bureau chief David Bohrman, who worked with Jennings for more than a decade as a senior producer at ABC.
"You always got the impression that he felt he was going to be exposed as a fraud any minute because he didn't finish school.
He just couldn't rest.
He never realized how good he was."
(End optional trim) Colleagues said Jennings also brought a sentimental, compassionate approach to stories that he rarely let viewers see.
Slavin said the anchor would push producers to home in on the emotional core of the news, such as a mother's loss of her son in Iraq.
"He is one of the most sensitive, emotional anchors in the business," said Slavin, repeatedly referring to Jennings in the present tense.
Up until his final days, Jennings believed he could win his battle with lung cancer, friends said.
"Frankly, I thought he would as well, because I knew what a brave, fierce competitor he was," Rather said.
"But the odds were too long."
Times staff writer Henry Weinstein contributed to this report.
Peter Jennings' four decade career as a network television reporter and anchor made him a national media star, but those who knew the ABC newsman best remembered him Tuesday in deeply personal terms, recalling the "goofy" father who loved to dance the jitterbug while cooking and the man of quiet generosity who took a personal interest in the homeless living in Central Park.
A two hour memorial service, held at Carnegie Hall a little more than a month after the 67 year old anchor died of lung cancer, focused less on his work as a broadcast journalist and more on recollections of his private life by family, friends and colleagues.
"He was often described as cosmopolitan, but I think my father valued awe over sophistication," said Christopher Jennings, his 23 year old son, noting his love of canoe trips and his fierce devotion to his family.
"The slightest achievement by his children or even his dog could wet his eyes," he said.
"My father gave love in earnest."
"Each day is, above all else, a day without him," his son added.
About 2000 people filled the gilded auditorium for the emotional celebration of Jennings' life, including nearly all of the top television network executives and journalists: NBC anchor Brian Williams, "Today" co hosts Katie Couric and Matt Lauer, former CBS anchor Dan Rather, current CBS anchor Bob Schieffer, "Good Morning America" co hosts Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer, Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, CNN anchor Aaron Brown and PBS interviewer Charlie Rose.
(Former NBC anchor Tom Brokaw was caring for his mother in California and could not attend.)
New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg attended, , as did his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and the Rev. Al Sharpton.
Performers included cellist Yo Yo Ma and jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis.
"From the time I first met Peter 41 years ago until our last meeting a few weeks ago, I felt a thrill whenever I saw him," said Ted Koppel, host of ABC's "Nightline."
"Not many people have genuine charisma, that kind of animal magnetism that makes it difficult to focus on anyone else in the room.
Peter had that."
Jennings' death on Aug 7, just four months after he had announced his diagnosis, has been a major blow to ABC.
The network has not settled on who will replace him as anchor of "World News Tonight."
Robert Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney Co., ABC's parent corporation, said the company owed Jennings "an extraordinary debt of gratitude" for his work, adding how difficult it was to accept his death.
"When you know someone of Peter's dynamism and presence, you simply think they will always be there," Iger said at the memorial.
But for the most part, speakers took note of their private loss.
A montage of photos projected on the back of the stage throughout the service depicted Jennings' off air life: bicycling and hanging off the side of a sailboat, embracing his children and walking arm in arm with his wife, Kayce Freed.
In the images, Jennings looked tan and healthy, squinting into the sun with a contented smile.
Actor Alan Alda said Jennings was simply "authentic."
He recalled how the anchor would insist on staying to help wash dishes after dinner parties and how he always gave him a book to read after visits, most recently a copy of the U.S. Constitution.
"There's a vacancy now that no president can fill, no power on Earth can fill," Alda said.
"Others will step in and fill in his shoes excellently.
But no one can replace the unique presence that was Peter."
Mary Brosnahan Sullivan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless, said a number of homeless people who live in the park across from Jennings' Manhattan apartment approached his widow, Kayce, after he died, offering their condolences and noting how he frequently took the time to speak with them.
Jennings often volunteered to distribute meals to the homeless around the city, she said, and would engage in long conversations with the people he met.
"Maybe today," she said, "we can try to see the world the way Peter saw it."
Jennings' 25 year old daughter, Elizabeth, spoke last, telling the tearful audience: "Without him, I find myself stumbling and in the dark,Loving him so much and not having him with me is the hardest thing I've ever done."
Peter Jennings, the ABC News anchor who died last month, was recalled as a devoted father, hard driving journalist and a man who befriended homeless people, during a service at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday.
The service was sprinkled with reflections from Jennings' colleagues at ABC, his two children and friends, like the actor Alan Alda.
Because Jennings was a music lover, there was music, too, with selections that included bagpipers escorted by members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Wynton Marsalis on trumpet and a cello solo by Yo Yo Ma.
"We're left now with just a little bit of snow at the bottom of the screen," Alda said in describing Jennings as irreplaceable.
He was a "truly authentic" person who conveyed his mix of graciousness, candor and concern to the millions who watched him as anchor of "World News Tonight," Alda said.
He never left Jennings' home without a book in tow, Alda recalled, and Jennings a Canadian who became a U.S. citizen always carried a copy of the Constitution.
Others recalled Jennings' fondness for canoeing, his way of putting people at ease and his heart on his sleeve sentimentality.
He was, they said, a friend who stuck around for life's inevitable heartbreaks.
"He never, ever let us down," said Charles Glass, a journalist who helped Jennings cover the Arab Israeli war for ABC.
With lines stretching around the block, the two hour service attracted ordinary people paying their respects, ABC and Walt Disney Co. executives and colleagues who included Ted Koppel, Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, Larry King, Jon Stewart and Katie Couric.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani also attended, as did Al Sharpton.
Photographs of Jennings, often with friends or with his children, Christopher and Elizabeth Jennings, were flashed on a big screen in the cavernous Stern Auditorium.
Jennings, one of the most recognizable journalists on American television, died on Aug 7 from lung cancer.
He was 67 years old.
Koppel drew laughter throughout his remarks.
He facetiously announced that he was not gay, but then said that during their 41 year friendship he was keenly aware of his friend's extraordinary charisma.
"I felt a thrill whenever I saw him," he said.
He continued: "Peter was notoriously attractive to women.
Even so, he only married four of them."
Robert A. Iger, president of the Walt Disney Co., remembered Jennings' "uncanny ability to entertain and to inform," as the primary face of ABC during significant world events.
At the same time, during a recent lunch, Jennings agreed with him that nothing was more satisfying than seeing their children grow up, Iger said.
Tom Nagorski, the producer of "World News Tonight," said Jennings' former staffers now wear plastic blue bracelets that say, "What would Peter do?"
Jennings was forever arranging and rearranging his staff's personal and professional lives, he said.
He even chided Nagorski, then the foreign editor, for planning his wedding at the same time as the elections in South Africa.
Then, with characteristic good cheer, Jennings offered to help with wedding plans, he said.
Jennings' widow, Kayce Freed, has been stopped in recent weeks by numerous homeless people offering their condolences, said Mary Brosnahan Sullivan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless.
For the homeless, Jennings delivered meals, inquired about their lives and donated money to organizations, Sullivan said.
Christopher Jennings said his father integrated his children into his world, taking them to his office and on assignment, soliciting their viewpoints.
Jennings was often described as cosmopolitan, he said, but he was also a man who always cherished "the ability to be awed."
Peter Jennings, the suave, Canadian born broadcaster who delivered the news to Americans each night in five separate decades, died at age 67.
Jennings, who announced in April that he had lung cancer, died Sunday at his New York home, ABC News President David Westin said in a statement.
"Peter has been our colleague, our friend, and our leader in so many ways," Westin said.
"None of us will be the same without him."
With Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather, Jennings was part of a triumvirate that dominated network news for more than two decades, through the birth of cable news and the Internet.
His smooth delivery and years of international reporting made him particularly popular among urban dwellers.
"Peter was born to be an anchor," Brokaw said Monday on NBC's "Today."
He said he met Jennings in 1966 covering Ronald Reagan's campaign for California governor and "we had an instant friendship."
Rather, appearing on ABC's "Good Morning America" tribute to Jennings, noted that beneath Jennings' polished exterior was a fierce competitor.
"If Peter was in the area code, I didn't sleep," Rather said.
Jennings dominated the ratings from the late 1980s to the mid '90s, when Brokaw surpassed him.
He remained a Canadian until 2003, when he became a U.S. citizen, saying it had nothing to do with his politics he did it for his family.
"He was a warm and loving and surprisingly sentimental man," said fellow ABC anchor Ted Koppel.
Jennings deeply regretted dropping out of high school, and he would have wanted that lesson passed along, Koppel said.
He made up for it by becoming a student of the world, studying cultures and their people for the rest of his life.
"No one could ad lib like Peter," said Barbara Walters.
"Sometimes he drove me crazy because he knew every detail,He just died much too young."
Jennings was wherever the big story was.
He logged more than 60 hours on the air during the week of the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, offering a soothing sense of continuity during a troubled time.
"There are a lot of people who think our job is to reassure the public every night that their home, their community and their nation is safe," he told author Jeff Alan.
"I don't subscribe to that at all.
I subscribe to leaving people with essentially sorry it's a cliche a rough draft of history.
Some days it's reassuring, some days it's absolutely destructive."
Jennings' announcement four months ago that the longtime smoker would begin treatment for lung cancer came as a shock.
"I will continue to do the broadcast," he said, his voice husky, in a taped message that night.
"On good days, my voice will not always be like this."
Although Jennings occasionally came to the office between chemotherapy treatments, he never again appeared on air.
Broadcasting was the family business for Jennings.
His father, Charles Jennings, was the first person to anchor a nightly national news program in Canada and later became head of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.'s news division.
A picture of his father was displayed prominently in Jennings' office off ABC's newsroom.
Charles Jennings' son had a Saturday morning radio show in Ottawa at age 9.
Jennings never completed high school or college, and began his career as a reporter at a radio station in Brockville, Ontario.
He quickly earned an anchor job at Canadian Television.
Sent south to cover the Democratic national convention in 1964, the handsome, dashing correspondent was noticed by ABC's news president.
Jennings was offered a reporting job and left Canada for New York.
As the third place news network, ABC figured its only chance was to go after young viewers.
Jennings was picked to anchor the evening news and debuted on Feb 1, 1965.
He was 26.
"It was a little ridiculous when you think about it," Jennings told author Barbara Matusow.
"I was simply unqualified."
Critics savaged him as a pretty face, and the experiment ended three years later.
He later described the humbling experience as an opportunity, "because I was obliged to figure out who I was and what I really wanted to be."
Assigned as a foreign correspondent, Jennings thrived.
He established an ABC News bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, and became an expert on the Middle East.
He won a Peabody Award for a 1974 profile of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
Jennings returned to the evening news a decade after his unceremonious departure and became the evening news anchor in 1983.
Starting in 1986, Jennings began a decade on top of the ratings.
He is survived by his wife, Kayce Freed, and his two children, Elizabeth, 25, and Christopher, 23.
Peter Jennings, a Canadian born high school dropout who became the face of ABC News and a household name in the United States, died of lung cancer Sunday at his home in New York.
He was 67.
ABC News announced his death Sunday night and released a statement from his wife Kayce Freed, his 25 year old daughter Elizabeth Jennings and his 23 year old son Christopher Jennings.
"Peter died with his family around him, without pain and in peace," it read.
"He knew he'd lived a good life."
His death was met with grief at ABC, where he functioned as both the public face and behind the scenes manager of "World News Tonight."
ABC News President David Westin called the 41 year ABC veteran known for his urbane demeanor and driven perfectionism "our colleague, our friend, and our leader," adding: "None of us will be the same without him."
Westin said Jennings had faced his fight against lung cancer "with realism, courage, and a firm hope that he would be one of the fortunate ones."
"In the end, he was not," he said.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in U.S. men and women, accounting for 163510 deaths this year.
Most cases of lung cancer are directly attributable to smoking.
A lung cancer diagnosis presents a poor prognosis, with a one year survival rate of only 42 percent and a five year rate of 15 percent.
Jennings' death comes as a bitter bookend to a decades long era in television news dominated by three well known figures: the longtime ABC newsman, CBS' Dan Rather and NBC's Tom Brokaw.
Brokaw retired in December, and Rather stepped down from the evening news in March.
A longtime smoker, Jennings first announced his diagnosis April 5, when he said he would begin chemotherapy treatment.
In a poignant taped message that aired on "World News Tonight," Jennings his voice already hoarse and raw said he had quit smoking 20 year ago but was "weak" and took it up again after the Sept 11, 2001, attacks.
He pledged to continue to anchor "World News Tonight" on "good days."
That was his last time on the air.
In his absence, "Good Morning America" co host Charles Gibson and "20/20" co anchor Elizabeth Vargas, among others, have filled in for him.
During his four decades at ABC especially his last 22 as anchor Jennings developed a reputation for rigorous standards and a devotion to substantive stories, especially international affairs.
As managing editor of "World News Tonight," he combed over every script that went on the broadcast.
"Peter was a real guardian at the gate," said Judy Muller, a contributing ABC correspondent and an assistant professor at the University of Southern California.
"He was so committed to the integrity of news."
Peter Charles Archibald Ewart Jennings was born on July 29, 1938, in Toronto.
He spent most of his childhood in Ottawa.
He gained his passion for broadcast news from his father, Charles Jennings, who was the first person to anchor a nightly national news program in Canada and became head of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's news division.
Jennings once referred him as his "only hero."
At age 9, Jennings was already hosting a weekly children's show called "Peter's People" on CBC radio, reading letters from children on the air.
But he was unenthusiastic about school and dropped out of high school in the 10th grade.
He quickly made his way in broadcasting, working for a small radio station in Brockville, Ontario, and then landing a job as the host of a CBC public affairs show in Montreal.
At age 24, he was already co anchoring Canada's first private network newscast and was spotted by an ABC correspondent covering a NATO meeting.
ABC recruited the young anchor in 1964.
Impressed with his good looks and poise, the network thrust him briefly into the anchor chair, but the 26 year old proved to be too green for the post.
In 1967, he began his career as a foreign correspondent, opening the network's bureau in Beirut, Lebanon.
He rapidly made his mark in covering hot spots around the world.
He was in Munich, Germany, in 1972 when Arab terrorists took Israeli athletes hostage at the Olympics.
He covered the battle over apartheid in South Africa and was in Berlin to report on the Berlin Wall coming down.
Jennings became ABC's chief foreign correspondent and was based in London when the network asked him to return to the anchor desk as part of a three person team, with Frank Reynolds based in Washington and Max Robinson in Chicago.
When Reynolds died of cancer in 1983, Jennings took over as the only anchor.
He helped power ABC to the top of the ratings for a decade, winning over viewers with his witty, sophisticated manner.
He continued to travel extensively to cover stories, and was most recently in Iraq in January to report on the elections there.
"He was a person with an enormous amount of experience and self confidence and a presence," said Richard Wald, a former ABC News executive.
"That's all you can say about him.
He had it, he always did."
Aside from his wife and children, he is survived by his sister Sarah Jennings.
There was no immediate word on services.
ABC News anchor Peter Jennings has been diagnosed with lung cancer, the network announced Tuesday, and will immediately begin a round of outpatient chemotherapy that is expected to keep him from the anchor desk at times in the coming months.
The 66 year old newsman, who smoked when he was younger, had been feeling ill during the last several days and was diagnosed Monday afternoon.
He broke the news to his senior staff at "World News Tonight" in an e mail Tuesday morning, saying he hoped to continue to anchor throughout his treatment.
"There will be good days and bad, which means that some days I may be cranky and some days really cranky!" he wrote.
"Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer.
I am sure I will learn from them how to cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated."
Jennings' announcement provoked sadness and dismay among his colleagues at ABC, where the anchor plays a central role in leading the news division.
His illness may sideline, at least temporarily, one of the last remaining lions of network news, coming on the heels of the departures of NBC anchor Tom Brokaw and CBS anchor Dan Rather from their evening newscasts.
Another television veteran, Ted Koppel, announced last week that he was leaving ABC and "Nightline" at the end of the year.
Jennings, who has anchored "World News Tonight" since 1983, led the newscast Friday and is expected to do so again tonight.
He begins treatment in New York next week.
A network spokeswoman declined to identify the location, citing his privacy.
ABC News President David Westin told the network's staff that he and Jennings expect the anchor to continue the newscast during his treatment "to the extent he can do so comfortably."
"But we should also expect him to be off the broadcast from time to time, depending on how he feels," Westin wrote in an e mail to the entire staff, adding that Charlie Gibson and Elizabeth Vargas, among others, would substitute for Jennings.
"Peter's been given a tough assignment," Westin added.
"He's already bringing to this new challenge the courage and strength we've seen so often in his reporting from the field and in anchoring ABC News.
I know that all of us will give him every bit of support that he needs and asks for.
Peter will once again lead the way, but we will stand with him at every turn."
Jennings called the diagnosis "quite a surprise" and expressed gratitude for his colleagues.
"In all the years I have worked here I have had the most outstanding support from this news division," he wrote.
"Hundreds of you have been like family.
It feels good to have such a family right now."
Jennings did not go to Rome to cover Pope John Paul II's death.
And he stayed back from Asia after the disastrous tsunami in December.
At the time, ABC said Jennings had a severe upper respiratory infection, and the network sent Diane Sawyer.
Jennings joined ABC News in 1964.
Jennings has won 14 national Emmys, several Alfred I. duPont Columbia University awards, several Overseas Press Club awards and a George Foster Peabody award.
Times staff writers Scott Collins and Mary MacVean contributed to this report.
"World News Tonight" anchor Peter Jennings has lung cancer, ABC announced Tuesday, but plans to remain on the job throughout his treatment.
He and ABC News President David Westin sent e mails to their newsroom colleagues about the diagnosis, which Jennings received Monday.
Westin called the news "a tough assignment," while Jennings, 66, said it was "quite a surprise."
A former smoker who quit some years ago, Jennings will begin outpatient chemotherapy treatment next week in New York, but he intends to continue broadcasting as his health permits.
In his e mail, Westin wrote, "It's both Peter's and my expectation that he will anchor 'World News Tonight' during the period of treatment to the extent he can do so comfortably, but, we should also expect him to be off the broadcast from time to time, depending on how he feels."
Charles Gibson, Elizabeth Vargas and others will substitute for Jennings as necessary.
Jennings wrote of his coming treatment: "There will be good days and bad, which means that some days I may be cranky and some days really cranky!
"Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer.
I am sure I will learn from them how to cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated."
The news comes at a time when Jennings remains virtually the last of the longtime network anchors.
NBC's Tom Brokaw signed off in December.
Dan Rather left his desk at CBS a month ago.
Last week, Jennings' ABC colleague Ted Koppel announced he will leave "Nightline" this December.
Once the main source of news for TV watchers, these network anchors have lost viewers over the past decade because of the proliferation of alternate news resources on cable TV and the Internet.
In Rather's absence, CBS executives have discussed experimenting with the time honored "voice of God," single anchor format.
"This will probably be a momentous year for network news," says Michael Castengera, a lecturer at the University of Georgia's Grady College of Journalism and an independent media consultant.
"As the struggle continues to win viewers, people at very high levels at the networks are going to have to make some tough decisions."
As a coach for aspiring broadcasters, Castengera has told his students to watch Jennings' broadcasts, "because he has such a relaxed, personable style that makes him very easy to relate to," he says.
"Peter Jennings is one of the few anchors that people almost invariably say, 'Yes, I could see sitting down and having a drink with him and talking casually about issues.'
" Jennings joined ABC News in 1964 and served as the anchor of "ABC Evening News" from 1965 to 1968.
He was foreign desk anchor for "World News Tonight" from 1978 to 1983, the year he was named the program's anchor and senior editor.
Born in Toronto, he became a U.S. citizen in 2003.

Peter Jennings, the last of the three major anchors of his era who is still working on a nightly newscast, revealed Tuesday that he has lung cancer and that he will begin chemotherapy next week.
E mail messages released Tuesday by Jennings and ABC News president David Westin stressed that Jennings, who is 66 and who has anchored ABC's "World News Tonight" since 1983, will continue to work during treatment, provided he feels well enough.
Jennings decided late Tuesday not to anchor Tuesday night's program and was replaced by "20/20" coanchor Elizabeth Vargas.
The dramatic news which comes on the heels of last week's announcement that "Nightline" host Ted Koppel will leave at year's end and which follows the recent departures of CBS and NBC anchors Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw reinforces the idea that a chapter in television journalism is coming to an end.
"Your initial reaction is you wish Peter Jennings well," said J. Max Robins, editor in chief at Broadcasting & Cable magazine.
"You really wonder, if given this kind of narrowcasting environment, we'll ever see people of this iconic stature again in the news business."
The health of Jennings, a former smoker, surfaced as an issue late last year, when he was unable to travel abroad for coverage of the devastating tsunami in southern and Southeast Asia.
At the time, ABC insiders thought he was battling a lingering flu or a similar ailment.
The announcement Tuesday seemed to stun the network.
"Obviously this is a very emotional day at ABC News," said a spokesman, Jeffrey Schneider.
"Everybody is rallying around Peter, and we are here to help him get through this and beat this."
He added: "We expect him to be the anchor for many years to come."
NBC completed a lengthy and smoothly choreographed transition in December when Brian Williams succeeded Brokaw in the anchor chair.
At CBS, Rather's announcement last November that he would step down, which followed a furor over the flawed "60 Minutes Wednesday" report on President Bush's military record, left that network scrambling for a successor.
Veteran correspondent Bob Schieffer was picked to fill the slot on an interim basis when Rather departed last month.
ABC's "World News Tonight" is currently in second place in the nightly news wars, but it has been breathing down the neck of the ratings leader, "NBC Nightly News."
(For the week that ended April 1, ABC's newscast averaged almost 9.5 million viewers, compared with 10 million for NBC.)
Until now, there has not been much public discussion about an eventual successor to Jennings, who has worked at ABC News since 1964.
Schneider said the diagnosis has not caused the network to focus more intently on the Jennings succession.
In his e mail to the staff, Westin said that when Jennings is unable to work, Vargas and "Good Morning America" cohost Charles Gibson would be among the substitutes.
Others likely to fill in include chief White House correspondent Terry Moran and network correspondent Bob Woodruff.
While making Jennings's condition public, the network did not provide details about the diagnosis or prognosis.
Westin wrote that the anchor would undergo outpatient treatment in New York and that "we should also expect him to be off the broadcast from time to time."
In his own e mail to his colleagues, Jennings said: "There will be good days and bad, which means that some days I may be cranky and some days really cranky!
"Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer.
I am sure I will learn from them how to cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated."
Dr Scott Swanson, a thoracic surgeon at New York's Mount Sinai Medical Center who specializes in lung cancer, said of Jennings: "He seems pretty healthy now.
In terms of the chemotherapy stopping him, most people do work through chemotherapy."
"Lung cancer in general is aggressive," Swanson added.
"Overall, we're still having a hard time with it, mainly because we're not finding it in an early phase."
Anchorman: The very word suggests security and gravitas.
Serious but sympathetic, the timbre of his voice is a firm tenor or a stentorian baritone, perhaps a bit tense in dire straits, but never panicky.
Closing out the night watch, his signature sign off sounds like a benediction.
"Good night and good luck," said Edward R. Murrow.
"And that's the way it is," asserted the decisive Walter Cronkite.
The future of the iconic American anchorman was on the minds of many this week as the news that Peter Jennings had been diagnosed with lung cancer raised concerns that he wouldn't be able to continue as anchor at ABC News.
After the long goodbye of NBC's Tom Brokaw (who served from 1983 until December), and the forced retirement of CBS' besieged Dan Rather (in harness from 1981 until March), the departure of the 66 year old Jennings (sole anchor since 1978) would complete a clean sweep of the venerable troika from the erstwhile Big Three.
Even more significant, it would mark the end of a special kind of personality driven news experience the last unique legacy (reruns not included) of the classic age of broadcast television.
The anchor's roots reach back to the birth of modern broadcast journalism in 1938, when CBS Radio launched its "World News Roundup" just in time to track Hitler marauding across Europe.
The declamatory style of the town crier announcer (familiar as the so called Voice of God in the Hollywood newsreels) soon gave way to a new reportorial model in which the journalist became a commentator as well, guiding the listener through strange doings and complex geopolitics.
Murrow, of course, was the prototype for this new breed of broadcast journalist.
When he moved from radio to TV, his visible presence only intensified the emotional link: the movie star looks, the patrician manner, the cigarette smoke swirling around his head like incense.
On March 9, 1954, when Murrow delivered a slashing broadside at Sen Joseph McCarthy, he was cashing in a lifetime of moral capital accrued from Munich to Panmunjom.
As an anchor, Murrow was a bit of a bust, but another candidate was waiting in the wings.
During the TV coverage of the 1952 presidential conventions, CBS News President Sig Mickelson coined the term "anchorman" for his primary on air reporter.
The man Mickelson picked was Walter Cronkite.
Cronkite had to wait until 1962 before taking the reins of "The CBS Evening News" away from Douglas Edwards, but 1963 was his breakout year.
That September, first CBS and then NBC expanded their news broadcasts from 15 minutes to 30.
Then, over a vertiginous four days that November, the Kennedy assassination sent millions of Americans to the anchor to calm their nerves and soothe their souls.
Cronkite's iconic bearing of the bad news ("From Dallas, Texas, a flash, apparently official,") has long since become audiovisual shorthand for the moment of impact: pulling off his glasses, choking up, stoically going forward.
Like Murrow, Cronkite spent his capital carefully, trading on his cheerleading for NASA to cover his flanks when he turned against the Vietnam War after the 1968 Tet offensive.
The anchor was always careful not to run too far ahead of his Nielsen demographic maybe a few feet ahead of the fashion curve, but never out on the cutting edge.
It was around this time that Cronkite earned his sobriquet as "the most trusted man in America," not as impressive as it sounds given the competition.
In 1981, the same year that Rather edged out the eminence gris, a more significant milestone in the annals of anchordom appeared on screen: CNN, the beginning of 24 hour news and the end of the networks' monopoly.
By the 1990s, from the Gulf War through O.J. TV to the massacre at Columbine High School, a multiplicity of news options and a dizzying cast of faces were available to bear the bad tidings.
The dinnertime newscast once de rigueur from coast to coast became a missable feast for Americans who had been munching all day on cable and the Internet.
(From their high water mark in the late 1960s, ratings for the network newscasts have plummeted by 60 percent.)
Tellingly, the most traumatic day in U.S. broadcasting history 9/11 bequeathed no equivalent to Cronkite's JFK moment: The images of disaster are indelible, but no face, gesture or remark from a single newscaster stands out.
Over the years, American anchormen derived their authoritative profile less from anything they did than from the simple fact of prolonged exposure, repeated ceremonially for years, in a hegemonic media environment.
In this sense, it is hard to lament the transfer of power from the great and powerful men in front of the curtain to every munchkin with a modem.
Yet it also is hard not to get a little sentimental over the end of a tradition that well served the news, and, on occasion, the nation.
Peter Jennings, the last of the three long dominant network anchors still on the job, said Tuesday he has been diagnosed with lung cancer.
Jennings, 66, plans to begin chemotherapy and to continue to anchor ABC's "World News Tonight" when he can, but specialists said the decision to forgo surgery suggests a more advanced form of cancer for which long term survival rates are relatively low.
Jennings had planned to anchor Tuesday night's newscast, but decided an hour before airtime that his voice was too weak.
In a videotaped message, he disclosed the diagnosis in a raspy voice, saying, "Yes, I was a smoker until about 20 years ago, and I was weak and smoked over 9/11.
But whatever the reason, the news does slow you down a bit,The National Cancer Institute says that we are survivors from the moment of diagnosis.
I will continue to do the broadcast, on good days my voice will not always be like this."
After a four month period in which Tom Brokaw retired at NBC, Dan Rather relinquished the anchor chair at CBS and Ted Koppel said he was leaving ABC, Jennings's illness underscored the generational shift underway at the broadcast networks.
They have been losing audience share for two decades but still reach 30 million people with their evening newscasts.
Jennings has been the face of ABC News for much of his 40 year career there, first as anchor from 1965 to 1968, in what he has described as an unsuccessful tenure, then as part of a three man anchor team in 1978 before becoming solo anchor again in 1983.
Since Brokaw's departure in December, Jennings has brought his newscast close to the top rated "NBC Nightly News" in the Nielsens.
ABC anticipated Brokaw's resignation by kicking off a promotional campaign for Jennings with the tag line: "Trust is earned."
ABC News President David Westin said in a note to the staff that "Peter's been given a tough assignment.
He's already bringing to this new challenge the courage and strength we've seen so often in his reporting from the field and in anchoring ABC News."
Westin said Charlie Gibson, Elizabeth Vargas and others would fill in for Jennings when necessary.
Vargas got the last minute call Tuesday night.
ABC executives refused to provide medical details of the type or state of Jennings's cancer.
Nine in 10 lung cancer cases are related to smoking, and a diminishing risk continues even after someone quits.
Norman Edelman, chief medical officer of the American Lung Association, said a decision by patients not to seek surgery for lung cancer "suggests they believe it's already spread to a point where surgery does not offer a cure."
This is either because the cancer is at too advanced a stage or because it is a form called small cell cancer which occurs in about a quarter of such cases and has already spread to other parts of the body, he said.
Still, "chemotherapy can absolutely prolong life," said Edelman, who teaches at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
Michael Thun, vice president of epidemiology for the American Cancer Society, said that "the most effective treatment for localized lung cancer is surgical removal.
If it's already spread, then surgery is not an option."
Although the five year survival rate for men with operable lung cancer is 45 percent, he said, it is under 14 percent for more advanced cancer that cannot be removed.
Jennings, who had not been feeling well for months, got the diagnosis Monday afternoon and told his staff that night.
Some in the industry had been sniping at him for not going to Asia to cover the tsunami and not anchoring coverage of the pope's final hours Friday and Saturday or heading off to Rome.
"Peter has always been healthy as a horse and shows up for everything," said an ABC staffer who requested anonymity because network employees have been asked not to comment.
"For Peter not to be there for the pope truly did leave everyone saying there must be something terribly wrong."
But, the staffer added, "this is a man who will have no time and no patience for pity."
In a note to his staff, Jennings wrote, "Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer.
I am sure I will learn from them how to cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated."
He added: "There will be good days and bad, which means that some days I may be cranky and some days really cranky!"
Jennings added a similarly light note on Tuesday night's broadcast, smiling several times and noting that he was "a little surprised at the kindness today from so many people,I wonder if other men and women ask their doctors right away, 'OK, Doc, when does the hair go?"
Jennings, Rather and Brokaw once dominated the media landscape, to a degree unimaginable today, because beginning in the early 1980s they reached about half the television audience, unchallenged by cable news then in its infancy or talk radio or the Internet.
By the time newer and faster technological rivals, including bloggers who often criticized them, came on the scene, the Big Three anchors were well established figures from having chronicled so many national and global stories, from war to impeachment to terrorism.
A younger generation of anchors mostly lacks that depth of experience Jennings as a Middle East based correspondent for seven years, Rather as a White House correspondent and "60 Minutes" contributor, Brokaw as a White House reporter and "Today" host.
NBC planned best for the inevitable succession, anointing Brian Williams, 45, who has held onto the ratings lead, 21/2 years before he took over in December.
CBS had no replacement ready when Rather, under pressure from his botching of the story about President Bush's military service, stepped down last month, although Bob Schieffer, 68, has won praise as interim anchor for his more conversational style.
ABC, despite a stable of high priced stars like Koppel and Barbara Walters, never groomed an obvious young successor to Jennings.
And the evening news franchise itself, less lucrative than the popular morning shows, is often derided as an anachronism with an aging core of loyal viewers.
"Good Morning America" co host Diane Sawyer, as well as Gibson, would be part of any shortlist, but both seem happy with their current situations.
Vargas is viewed as a rising star within the network.
Koppel, who plans to leave ABC in December over plans to make "Nightline" a live, hour long broadcast, has filled in for Jennings but never expressed interest in being a permanent evening anchor.
The son of a Canadian broadcaster, Jennings got dual U.S. citizenship after the 2001 terrorist attacks.
He was the courtliest of the Big Three anchors, the most frequently married four times and the least self promotional.
He often described himself as a terrible interview.
Alex Jones, director of Harvard's Shorenstein media center, said that when he interviewed Jennings two decades ago, "he was embarrassed that he had not finished high school and worked all the harder to be a superb journalist.
This was always a man who had a more graceful humor and air of sophistication, which came from his days as a foreign correspondent when he looked like something from a 1940s movie, handsome and dashing."
Because of his limited education, Jones said, "he took that spot as anchor with some trepidation."
Such was Jennings' longevity that he was in Germany when the Berlin Wall went up and when it came down.
Jennings was the first to establish a television bureau in the Middle East and one of three western journalists to witness Saddam Hussein's first appearance in an Iraqi court last year.
The winner of 14 Emmy Awards, he has reported from all 50 states and hosted specials such as "Peter Jennings Reporting," "The Search for Jesus," "The Kennedy Assassination Beyond Conspiracy" and, more recently, one on UFOs.
He also anchored the New Year's Eve broadcast at the turn of the millennium that won a Peabody Award.
"Peter is part of the DNA of ABC News," said spokesman Jeffrey Schneider.
"He's very strong and he's a fighter.
Obviously this is an emotional day here.
Everyone's first, second and third thoughts are for Peter's speedy recovery."
The news that Peter Jennings will be absent from "World News Tonight" for an indeterminate period while he is being treated for lung cancer has, at least from a business perspective, had its most profound impact on Jennings' ultimate boss, David Westin, the president of ABC News.
In the short run, the absence of Jennings threatens to undermine one of the chief goals Westin has set for his news division this year: to overtake its main rival, "NBC Nightly News," at a moment of potential vulnerability for NBC just as Brian Williams has lost some of the audience he inherited in December from Tom Brokaw.
Westin faces a far bigger dilemma in the long run.
With estimated annual advertising revenue of more than $100 million, "World News Tonight" is big business for ABC.
If Westin continues to simply patch together a lineup of substitute anchors while waiting for Jennings to recover his health, the network could squander the momentum it has already generated.
But if ABC News makes any long term strategic or personnel moves, including grooming a successor for the anchor chair, it could appear to be preparing for a future without Jennings, who, at 66, maybe the news network's biggest star.
Even as he began treatment last week as an outpatient, Jennings remained a presence on "World News Tonight," albeit backstage.
He was in regular e mail contact with Westin, Jonathan Banner, the program's executive producer, and others, going so far as to comment on scripts for upcoming shows.
One morning last week, he even participated via conference call in the program's 9 a.m. editorial meeting, his voice hoarse but strong.
Jennings has also been encouraged by Westin and Banner to come in and reclaim the anchor chair on any night he feels up to it, with as little as 45 minutes' notice.
"He's e mailing, he's suggesting stories," Banner said.
"Quite frankly, I think some of my colleagues might be surprised at how he's getting involved in scripts."
On March 31, less than a week before Jennings disclosed his cancer, Westin announced that Ted Koppel would be leaving "Nightline" and the network in December.
"It's a very dynamic time at ABC News," said Paul Slavin, a senior vice president in the division.
"There is a constant stream of big decisions coming down the road."
Peter Jennings revealed that he is suffering from lung cancer and plans to continue on "World News Tonight" as much as possible after beginning chemotherapy next week.
Jennings, ABC's chief anchorman since 1983, was replaced by Elizabeth Vargas on Tuesday but taped a message telling viewers about his diagnosis.
"I will continue to do the broadcast," he said.
"On good days, my voice will not always be like this.
Certainly, it's been a long time.
And I hope it goes without saying that a journalist who doesn't value deeply the audience's loyalty should be in another line of work."
A former smoker who quit 20 years ago, Jennings resumed smoking briefly after the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
The 66 year old anchor was too ill to work Saturday during the network's special report on Pope John Paul II's death.
He hasn't been feeling well the past few months, and didn't travel under doctor's orders after December's tsunami because of what was described then as an upper respiratory infection.
He did go to Iraq in January for the elections.
Jennings said he was surprised at how fast the news traveled and at the kindness he had received from so many people.
"Finally," he said, "I wonder if other men and women ask their doctors right away: 'OK, doc, when does the hair go?"
Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in the United States, and roughly four out of five people diagnosed with the disease die within five years, said Dr Cliff Connery, chief of thoracic surgery at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan.
Doctors said most lung cancer patients can continue to work throughout treatment, but need flexibility to take it easy on days they are not feeling well.
With his very visible position on television each night, Jennings could be an inspiration for many others going through a similar fight, said Dr David Johnson, chief of oncology and hematology at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.
"I think it sets the right example," Johnson said.
"I think it says you shouldn't stop your life if you have cancer.
It may take your life, but you shouldn't let it control your life."
There are effective ways to treat lung cancer, but its mortality rate is so high because so many patients aren't diagnosed until their disease is in an advanced stage, Connery said.
Charles Gibson, Vargas and others will substitute for Jennings from time to time, said ABC News President David Westin.
Gibson is in Rome for coverage of the pope's funeral, an assignment that Jennings, a former Rome and London correspondent for ABC News, normally would have taken.
"He's already bringing to this new challenge the courage and strength we've seen so often in his reporting from the field and in anchoring ABC News," Westin told ABC staffers.
"I know that all of us will give him every bit of support that he needs and asks for."
Jennings is the last of the anchor troika that dominated U.S. broadcast network news divisions over the last two decades.
NBC's Tom Brokaw stepped down last year and CBS' Dan Rather left last month.
"Peter is an old friend," Brokaw said Tuesday.
"I'm heartbroken, but he's also a tough guy.
I'm counting on him getting through this very difficult passage."
While still in his 20s, Jennings anchored ABC's evening news for two years in the 1960s.
He returned to the desk in 1978 when third place ABC tried a multi anchor format, which was abandoned in 1983 when Frank Reynolds died from cancer.
Jennings has been ABC's sole evening anchor ever since.
A Canadian who proudly became a U.S. citizen in 2003, the urbane Jennings dominated the ratings from the late 1980s to the mid '90s, when Brokaw surpassed him.
"Jennings has served American broadcast news with a graceful internationalist intelligence," said Rich Hanley, director of graduate programs at Quinnipiac University's school of communications.
"His manner of news delivery stood in contrast to but not in opposition of the gentle Midwestern aesthetic expressed by Tom Brokaw and the don't mess with Texas eccentricity of Dan Rather."
Peter Jennings, in a statement read Friday night on ABC's "World News Tonight," shared with viewers his feelings about his battle with lung cancer and expressed gratitude for the support he has received from fans and friends.
The 66 year old anchorman had announced on April 6 that he was diagnosed with the disease and shortly thereafter began treatment.
"Thousands of you have spoiled me rotten with your attention in the last couple of weeks," Jennings said in a statement that was read on air by Elizabeth Vargas.
"So many experiences have meant something special.
A woman in my building who is a cancer survivor showed up at my front door so that we could see that bald really is beautiful.
She's right."
By allowing his feelings to be expressed on air, Jennings gave viewers an unusually personal glimpse of what it is like to have the disease as well as offering what may be solace to cancer patients, support group leaders said.
"What we see in Peter Jennings is a role model," said Suzanne Brace, executive director of HopeWell Cancer Support in Lutherville, Md.
"Whenever someone like that goes public, it gives others permission to talk about their cancers.
It also offers encouragement and courage.
People think, 'If he can go public with his employers about his cancer, maybe I can, too.'
" Jennings offered a further update on his treatment Friday in a letter posted on the abcnews.com Web site.
"Yesterday, I decided to go to the office, I live only a few blocks away.
I got as far as the bedroom door.
Chemo strikes," Jennings wrote.
"Do I detect a knowing but sympathetic smile on many of your faces?
You knew this was coming."
Jennings went on to describe notes and messages he had received from Sen Arlen Specter, R Pa., and Hamilton Jordan, former chief of staff in the administration of President Carter.
In a note, Specter told the anchorman, "the only way to get through chemo is to work your way through it."
"He's a tougher man than I am," Jennings said.
Jordan sent Jennings a book titled "No Such Thing as a Bad Day."
"He's had cancer four times.
He tells me, as have many others, that when it gets really bad, it will get better.
Whew!"
Jennings added.
"I won't soon forget an encounter as I was leaving the hospital.
A middle aged couple was going into the building and as they passed me, I heard my name and turned.
The woman stepped right in my face and said, 'Me too.
Lung cancer.'
Instinctively, immediately, we gave each other a hug a real hug and went on our respective ways knowing that we had been strengthened by the connection."
That kind of testimony from a public figure like Jennings can make a "huge difference" in peoples' lives, Brace said last night after hearing Jennings' remarks on the newscast.
"I was thinking back to when Betty Ford first went public with her breast cancer, and what a difference that made," Brace said.
"This does give people a way to say, 'Me too.'
" Jennings has not anchored the newscast since April 1.
Vargas and Charles Gibson, co host of "Good Morning America," have substituted for him.
The first message was posted just six minutes after the news broke April 5 that ABC anchor Peter Jennings had been diagnosed with lung cancer.
By the end of the week, more than 3400 e mails offering him prayers and good wishes had filled the network's online message board many of them expressing an intensely personal sense of grief.
"Our old and trusted friend, you have looked out for all of us for so long, and comforted us in our time of need," wrote Peggi and Ron Barratt.
"Please take the time to now look out for yourself."
While the announcement of Jennings' illness hit the already unsettled world of network news with even more turbulence, it also jolted television viewers, stripping them at least for a time of the last of the three familiar faces that had anchored the evening news for the past two decades.
Jennings still hopes to lead the newscast throughout his chemotherapy.
But he was unable to deliver the news last week because of a hoarse voice, and it remains unclear how frequently he will be on the air.
Viewer reaction to his illness underscored the challenge facing the networks as they usher in a new generation of evening news anchors: replicating the strong bonds that have developed between audiences and the iconic faces of ABC, NBC and CBS.
"The illusion that television has created is that we experience events, and the people that bring us through, that are our guides, are the network anchors," said Gary Edgerton, a professor at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., and co editor of the Journal of Popular Film and Television.
"We have these really intense, interpersonal connections with these stars."
NBC eased the transition from Tom Brokaw to Brian Williams in December by announcing the move two years ahead of time and giving viewers ample opportunities to watch Williams as a substitute anchor.
CBS tapped a veteran newsman, Bob Schieffer, to temporarily replace Dan Rather when he left the newscast last month.
Jennings' diagnosis forces ABC executives to begin contemplating the question of succession, too a matter most had assumed would be at least several years off.
"It signals the transition that ABC inevitably is going to have to make," said Charles Bierbauer, a former CNN and ABC correspondent who serves as dean of the University of South Carolina's College of Mass Communications and Information Studies.
"The simple fact is that the generation is changing."
But transferring viewer affection to new anchors is not a simple matter, media experts said.
"These are the type of interactions that have to be developed over time," said Jeffrey McCall, a professor of communications at Depauw University in Greencastle, Ind., who noted that competitive pressures from all news cable channels, the Internet and other news sources limit the amount of time new anchors have to bond with their audiences.
"Network news is in a big pickle," he said.
"They can't afford to let whoever takes over the time to grow into the role."
Some executives actually view the turnover as an opportunity to radically remake the broadcasts in hopes of appealing to a younger demographic.
CBS Chairman and Chief Executive Leslie Moonves has called the traditional "voice of God" anchor an antiquated concept and suggested that his network may roll out a more irreverent, multi anchor format.
"Those days are over where you have that guy sitting behind the desk that everybody believes to the nth degree," he told reporters in January.
But TV news correspondent and anchor Morton Dean dismissed the idea that audiences no longer seek that kind of relationship.
"I think it's a mistake for anybody to think anchors are no longer as important as they once were, because when there's a crisis in America, or affecting America, people turn to someone they trust," said Dean, who worked at CBS and ABC.
The audience for the three major evening newscasts has shrunk considerably amid growing competition, yet they still combine to attract upward of 26 million people each weeknight.
Indeed, there was ample evidence last week that viewers greatly value the intimacy and confidence they have felt with Jennings, who has anchored "World News Tonight" for 22 years.
ABC's Web site was flooded with emotional testimonials from people about his effect on their lives, many referring to him as a member of the family.
An Ohio mother said she and her children say, "Good night, Peter" every night after the newscast.
A college student wrote that she never misses his broadcasts and that she used to watch it nightly with her father.
Viewer after viewer cited Jennings' handling of coverage of the Sept 11 attacks as a welcome balm during a horrific day.
A second grade teacher from Wilmington, N. C., said Jennings' demeanor "gave your viewers a sense of peace, that everything would eventually be better than it was at that moment" and helped "explain the unexplainable to our children."
A Cincinnati viewer wrote that "when the nation circles its wagons, you are the wagon master that provides us with a sense of calm."
"Life won't be the same till you're back in the living rooms of America every night," wrote a woman identified as Marilyn L. Stuart Fischoff, a professor emeritus of media psychology at California State University, Los Angeles, said he is not surprised by the emotional responses to Jennings' absence from the newscast last week.
"There is research that shows when you remove pivotal people on television from a person's daily life, they feel like they've had a death in the family," he said.
"They feel rootless."
ABC executives stress that Jennings is still the anchor of "World News Tonight" and will do the broadcast whenever he feels up to it.
When he can't, he still plans to exert a strong force in shaping the newscast.
"We are enormously grateful for the loyalty of our audience, and we expect they will continue to get their news from Peter Jennings," ABC News spokesman Jeffrey Schneider said.
"Nights when they don't see him physically on the air, they know his steady hand is on the tiller."
Schneider insisted that ABC executives are focused on Jennings' recovery.
But TV news veterans said the network must consider who will take over if Jennings is unable to continue.
Charles Gibson, co host of "Good Morning America," and "20/20" co anchor Elizabeth Vargas, who are filling in for Jennings temporarily, are considered possible permanent replacements for the longtime anchor, along with "World News Tonight Saturday" anchor Bob Woodruff and chief White House correspondent Terry Moran.
But Robert Zelnick, chairman of Boston University's Department of Journalism and a former ABC News correspondent, said it would be hard to find an adequate replacement.
"This is a body blow to ABC and to aficionados of evening news," he said.
"I've been walking around for days feeling a lump of sadness.
He's been such a big part of our lives."
Peter Jennings, the sole anchor of the ABC evening newscast for the past 22 years, announced Tuesday that he was suffering from lung cancer and had begun treatment.
ABC said Jennings, 66, would work as often as he could during his course of treatment.
But the network, which has seen the recent replacement of anchors at NBC and CBS as an opportunity for Jennings to vault into the ratings leadership, is planning to use substitute anchors, including Charles Gibson and Elizabeth Vargas, in his absence.
Jennings was unable to anchor the ABC newscast on Tuesday night, though he had originally planned to.
He did tape a brief commentary to close the newscast, speaking in a hoarse and strained voice.
He said: "The National Cancer Institute says that we are survivors from the moment of diagnosis.
I will continue to do the broadcast.
On good days, my voice will not always be like this.
Certainly, it's been a long time.
And I hope it goes without saying that a journalist who doesn't value deeply the audience's loyalty should be in another line of work."
ABC News emphasized that Jennings would remain its evening news anchor.
In an e mail message to his staff on Tuesday, David Westin, the president of ABC News, praised Jennings for his leadership of the news division over the years and expressed the division's support as he encountered this challenge.
"Peter will once again lead the way but we will stand with him at every turn," Westin said.
He added that Jennings would undergo outpatient treatment in New York and would continue to work on the newscast "to the extent he can do so comfortably."
Jennings had been a heavy smoker until the mid to late 1980s, colleagues said.
He quit at that time, though the colleagues said it was an enormous struggle for him and periodically he was known to sneak a cigarette or two.
At one point, Jennings and his executive producer then, Paul Friedman, visited a hypnotist in Boston seeking to break their addictions to cigarettes.
That treatment worked for a time, but as Jennings acknowledged in his commentary on Tuesday night, he returned to regular smoking after the terrorist attacks in 2001.
He later quit again, a colleague said.
Lung cancer is usually difficult to treat.
While the prognosis depends on the type of lung cancer, the overall cure rate is just 16 percent.
Sixty percent of lung cancer patients die within a year of diagnosis, and nearly 75 percent die within two years.
US pharmaceutical giant Merck on Friday disputed the conclusion of the British medical weekly The Lancet that the arthritis drug Vioxx should have been pulled from the market four years earlier.
Merck said it posted a scientific critique on its website "to further clarify for the scientific community why Merck disagrees with the conclusions" of The Lancet.
The Lancet report said there was enough evidence four years ago linking the drug to an increased risk of strokes and heart attacks.
Merck claimed however that "it was vigilant in monitoring and disclosing the cardiovascular safety" of Vioxx and added that the company "absolutely disagrees with any implication to the contrary."
The statement said the scientific critique details why Merck disagrees with analysis of The Lancet and added that until a study this year, "data from Merck's clinical trials showed no significant difference in cardiovascular risk" of Vioxx.
The British journal strongly criticized the US drug company, which withdrew the drug from the market in September, for failing to stop marketing the drug in 2000 when data showed Vioxx was potentially dangerous.
"The licensing of Vioxx and its continued use in the face of unambiguous evidence of harm have been public health catastrophes," editor Richard Horton said in a commentary.
"This controversy will not end with the drug's withdrawal."
Merck withdrew Vioxx based on the results of an internal three year study of 2600 patients, half of whom received a 25 milligram dose of Vioxx and half of whom received a placebo.
Drugs giant Merck and Co.'s shares slumped Tuesday after the firm revealed civil and criminal investigations into the sale of its pain drug Vioxx.
In the first half hour of trade, Merck shares dropped 55 cents, or 2.1 percent, to 26.02 dollars, completing a 42.3 percent plunge in the past six weeks.
In a public filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, Merck said it had been told of an informal SEC inquiry into Vioxx.
The firm said it had also received a subpoena from the US Department of Justice asking for information about its research, marketing and sales of Vioxx in a criminal health care investigation.
"The company will cooperate with the SEC and the Justice Department," Merck said in the filing.
"The company cannot predict the outcome of these inquiries, however, it is possible that highly unfavorable outcomes, including a potential civil disposition from the SEC and/or potential civil or criminal dispositions from the Justice Department, could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position, liquidity and results of operations," it said.
Merck pulled the 2.5 billion dollar a year seller Vioxx off the market on September 30, when an internal study found it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke after 18 months of continuous use.
A study sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration estimated that Vioxx could have caused 27785 heart attacks or deaths since it was approved in 1999.
Merck has disputed a report in the British medical weekly The Lancet, however, that there was enough evidence four years ago linking the drug to an increased risk of strokes and heart attacks.
A rash of lawsuits now plagues the firm because of the global Vioxx withdrawal.
Merck said it was unsure if its insurance would provide enough money to cover potential lawsuit losses.
With its stock price down sharply since pulling the painkiller Vioxx off the market, Merck & Co. adopted a plan guaranteeing large severance packages to 230 top executives if the company merges or is taken over.
The timing of the "golden parachutes," and their extension to so many executives, drew complaints from critics who said the firm's managers didn't deserve such a rich package after the Vioxx fiasco.
Separately, a major pension fund filed suit against Merck, alleging it misled shareholders about the safety of Vioxx.
Merck said the Justice Department had launched a criminal investigation into its handling of Vioxx, the blockbuster pain killing drug that it withdrew from the market after a study found long term use increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
The company warned that government probes, along with civil lawsuits, could have "highly unfavorable outcomes" for investors.
Moody's, meanwhile, dropped Merck's credit rating to reflect the sudden loss of revenue and new litigation exposure.
The pension fund of New York State filed a federal lawsuit Monday against Merck & Co. that accused Merck of misleading shareholders about the safety of its now withdrawn arthritis pain drug, Vioxx.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Trenton, N.J., said that the pension fund lost about $171 million on Sept 30 when the company, citing increased heart risks in tests of people using the drug for more than 18 months, withdrew it from the market.
On that day, the price of a share of Merck stock plummeted 27 percent.
Merck shares are down about 40 percent for the year, but closed up 35 cents Monday, at $28.02.
The lawsuit appears to be the first by a pension fund against Merck.
A spokeswoman for Merck, Joan Wainwright, said that about 15 lawsuits had been filed asserting that the company misled shareholders have been filed.
Merck is based in Whitehouse Station, N.J Several hundred personal injury lawsuit have also been filed against Merck by people claiming to have been injured Vioxx.
The company has denied any wrongdoing.
In a statement issued Monday, the New York State comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, maintained that Merck knew, but failed to disclose, that a growing body of evidence indicated that users of Vioxx were at increasing risk of suffering heart attacks, strokes and death.
"Merck must be held legally responsible for its actions," said Hevesi, who is also the pension fund's trustee.
"These actions have put lives at risk and cost shareholders billions of dollars."
In the lawsuit, Hevesi is seeking unspecified monetary damages.
Along with the company, the lawsuit names several individuals including the chief executive, Raymond V. Gilmartin.
Merck executives have disputed suggestions that they acted improperly and said that they moved promptly to withdraw Vioxx from the market after patients in a clinical trial experienced an increased rate of cardiovascular problems after 18 months of using the drug.
""Merck extensively studied Vioxx before seeking regulatory approval to market it," the spokeswoman, Wainwright, said.
"We promptly disclosed the clinical data about Vioxx.
When questions arose, we took additional steps, including conducting further prospective, controlled studies to gain more clinical information."
She said that Merck had not seen Hevesi's lawsuit and could not comment.
In his lawsuit, Hevesi cited recent newspaper reports, broadcast reports and medical journal articles that have raised questions about Merck's handling of safety issues surrounding Vioxx.
The safety questions first emerged soon after Vioxx was approved in 1999 for sale by federal regulators.
In 2000, for instance, a major clinical trial of the drug found that those taking it had a fivefold increased risk of heart attack compared to patients in the trial who took a comparative pain reliever, naproxen.
However, until recently, Merck executives said that those results did not reflect any dangers posed by Vioxx but rather that the cardioprotective effect of naproxen.
John Chartier, a spokesman for Hevesi, said that at end of September the New York State pension fund owned about 9.4 million shares of Merck.
In the lawsuit filed Monday in Trenton, Hevesi is asking the court to consolidate all securities related claims against Merck in connection with Vioxx into a single class action and to make him the lead plaintiff.
He also filed a separate but related lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court in New Orleans.
The New York State Common Retirement Fund, as the pension fund is officially known, is the second largest public pension fund in the country after the California fund.
It has approximately $120.8 billion in assets and more than 970000 retirees, beneficiaries and members.
An expert with the Federal Drug Administration on Thursday accused the agency in Congress of having pressed him to withhold results of a study showing potential dangers of the anti inflammatory drug Vioxx.
"I was pressured to change my conclusions and recommendations, and basically threatened that if I did not change them, I would not be permitted to present the paper at the conference," said David Graham, Associate Director for Science with the office of Drug Safety at the FDA.
Graham testified Thursday at a Senate hearing about his 2001 2004 study.
"One drug safety manager recommended that I should be barred from presenting the poster at the meeting and also noted that Merck needed to know our study results," he said.
Merck, the maker of Vioxx, which was approved by the FDA in 1999, voluntarily took the drug off the market in September.
Merck withdrew Vioxx based on the results of an internal three year study of 2600 patients, half of whom received a 25 mg dose of Vioxx and half of whom received a placebo.
The company said these patients, treated with Vioxx to thwart the resurgence of colorectal polyps, a common precursor to cancer, showed no undesirable effects during the first 18 months of the study begun in 2000.
However, said Peter Kim, president of Merck Research Laboratory, "while the cause of these results is uncertain at this time, they suggest an increased risk of confirmed cardiovascular events beginning after 18 months of continuous therapy."
Graham said: "the problem you are confronting today is immense in scope.
Vioxx is a terrible tragedy and a profound regulatory failure.
I would argue that the FDA, as currently configured, is incapable of protecting America against another Vioxx."
"The corporate culture within CDRE is also a barrier to effectively protecting the American people from unecessary harm due to prescription," he said.
Los Angeles Times: Early Vioxx Alarms Alleged.
Federal regulators and the drug maker Merck & Co.were aware of risks that the company's Vioxx painkiller could cause serious heart problems before the drug was approved in 1999, government and expert witnesses told a Senate committee.
Drug maker Merck & Co. said that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department are looking into the company's handling of Vioxx, the blockbuster arthritis drug it pulled off the market Sept 30 after safety studies showed it increased the risk of heart attacks.
In a regulatory filing Tuesday, Merck said the company is the subject of a criminal investigation from the Justice Department, which subpoenaed documents on the company's research, marketing and selling activities for Vioxx.
The company estimates 105 million prescriptions were written for the drug for 20 million patients in the United States from May 1999 to August 2004.
In 2003, Vioxx had U.S. sales of about $1.8 billion.
The SEC also told the company it was beginning its own informal inquiry regarding the drug.
Merck said it has also received a letter from the attorneys general in five states stating that its return and refund program for unused Vioxx will not provide consumers with adequate notice and will be unduly burdensome.
Merck said that it will cooperate with all information requests and investigations.
Shares of Merck fell 43 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $26.14 in the extended session after closing up 36 cents to $26.57 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Washington Post: Celebrex Trial Halted After Finding Of Heart Risk, Similar Side Effects Led To Withdrawal of Vioxx.
A clinical trial of the blockbuster arthritis drug Celebrex was shut down yesterday after researchers found an increase in the risk of serious heart disease and strokes in those taking the drug, the same side effects that caused the related painkiller Vioxx to be taken off the market this fall.
Nearly a year before Merck received results from the clinical trial that prompted the company to pull its painkiller Vioxx from the market, the company received preliminary results from a separate study of patient records that also apparently indicated the drug posed cardiovascular risks.
Merck has not publicly disclosed that separate study's results or referred to it in any of its recent statements about Vioxx's safety record since announcing in late September that it would stop selling the drug.
But a company spokeswoman, in response to a reporter's questions Wednesday, confirmed the study's existence and said that Merck, which paid for the research, had received its preliminary results last November and was given a final report 10 days before the company announced it would stop selling Vioxx.
Joan Wainwright, the Merck spokeswoman, said that the separate study, because it was based on patient records and not on an actual clinical trial, was inconclusive and had no bearing on the decision to withdraw Vioxx.
When it withdrew the drug from the market, Merck cited a long term trial showing that some patients, after taking Vioxx for 18 months, developed serious cardiovascular problems.
But Merck's critics continue to say that the company should have heeded signals years earlier that Vioxx might pose dangers.
The company's chief executive, Raymond V. Gilmartin, is expected to be interrogated on the matter on Thursday in a hearing by the Senate Finance Committee, which will also be examining the Food and Drug Administration's handling of Vioxx and other drug safety issues.
The study report that Merck received on Sept 20 was an analysis of patient records from the UnitedHealth Group.
It compared the relative rates of heart attack and stroke in people taking Vioxx, a similar drug Celebrex and traditional over the counter painkillers.
Wainwright said that the company, as a matter of policy, did not discuss study findings before their public release.
But one person who was briefed on the data and who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that the results indicated that Vioxx posed an increased risk of cardiovascular problems, compared with the other drugs studied.
Wainwright said that the study had been submitted for potential publication in a medical journal that she declined to identify and that there had been no intentional effort to delay disclosing the results.
The Senate hearing comes after the disclosure in recent weeks of internal Merck documents that suggest that the company may have side stepped questions about Vioxx's safety for several years and used hardball marketing tactics to allay doctors' concerns about the painkiller.
An FDA drug reviewer, Dr David Graham, has claimed that agency superiors discounted his efforts to call attention to the drug's problems.
Graham's main evidence is a study of patient records from the Kaiser Permanente health care system, which is similar in approach to the UnitedHealth Care study that Merck commissioned.
US drugs giant Merck said Thursday quarterly net profit tumbled as it took a 552.6 million dollar blow from the withdrawal of blockbuster arthritis drug Vioxx.
A rash of lawsuits also now plagues the firm because of the global Vioxx withdrawal on September 30, prompted by a study showing it increased the risk for strokes and heart attacks.
Merck said it was unsure if its insurance would provide enough money to cover potential lawsuit losses.
Sales fell 3.9 percent from a year earlier to 5.54 billion dollars in the three months to September 30.
Net profit slumped 28.7 to 1.33 billion dollars.
Earnings per share slid to 60 cents from 82.
In the last quarter of 2004, Merck said it expected earnings per share to slip to 48 to 53 cents, including the impact of about 700 million to 750 million dollars in lost Vioxx sales.
"The voluntary withdrawal of Vioxx, with sales of 2.5 billion dollars last year, represents a significant financial loss for us but clearly was the right course of action," Merck chairman, president and chief executive Raymond Gilmartin said.
"Merck is redeploying research and development and marketing and sales personnel formerly dedicated to Vioxx to areas where additional growth opportunities exist, including other research programs, support of in line products and upcoming product launches," he said in a statement.
About 20 million people have taken Vioxx in the United States since its 1999 launch, the company said.
The number of users outside the United States was "undetermined."
Merck said it had insurance for up to 630 million dollars related to a mass of personal injury lawsuits filed over Vioxx, though some of the insurers disputed the coverage, along with insurance for shareholder lawsuits.
"The company is unable at this time to determine whether the companys insurance coverage with respect to the Vioxx personal injury lawsuits and the Vioxx shareholder lawsuits will be adequate to cover its defense costs and losses, if any," the firm said.
As of October 15, Merck said the company had been named as a defendant in about 300 federal and state personal injury lawsuits including 900 plaintiff groups alleging personal injuries from its use.
There were also several putative class actions.
In addition to the personal injury suits, a number of purported class action suits had been filed by shareholders and by former employees with company retirement plans, alleging Merck and some current or former officials had made false and misleading statements about Vioxx.
Shares of Merck & Co. plunged more than 10 percent Monday after a media report said that documents show the pharmaceutical giant hid or denied evidence for years that its blockbuster arthritis drug Vioxx cause heart problems.
Merck, one of the world's top five drug makers, pulled the arthritis and acute pain drug from the market worldwide on Sept 30, saying it was acting in patients' best interest.
Vioxx has been taken by about 20 million Americans and had produced 11 percent of Merck's total revenues.
Also on Monday, Prudential Equity Group analyst Tim Anderson downgraded the stock's rating to neutral from overweight.
Anderson wrote that he believes there is value in the company's drug pipeline but said it is likely to get lost in the negative Vioxx coverage.
Additionally, Standard & Poor's placed Merck on CreditWatch with negative implications, which sends a strong signal that the company's debt could be downgraded within the next three months.
When Merck withdrew Vioxx, S&P lowered its outlook to negative from stable.
The additional, more serious step taken Monday reflects the momentum in the Vioxx litigation and the delay in launching Arcoxia, Vioxx's successor drugs, said S&P analyst Arthur Wong.
Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed against Merck over Vioxx and one analyst believes it could cost the company up to $12 billion.
Last Friday, the FDA said it wouldn't approve Arcoxia without additional safety and efficacy information.
Wong said it look like the drug will be delayed more than a year.
Merck shares were down $3.19, or 10.2 percent, at $28.12 on the New York Stock Exchange after The Wall Street Journal reported that internal e mails and marketing materials show the company knew as far back as 2000 that Vioxx was linked to an increased risk of heart attack but tried to discredit such evidence.
Despite a March 9, 2000 e mail from Merck research director Edward Scolnick to colleagues conceding an elevated risk of heart attack and stroke was "clearly there," according to the newspaper, Merck continued to try to discredit academic researchers critical of the drug.
The Journal reported that one training document from Merck listed potentially difficult questions about the drug and stated in capital letters, "DODGE!"
Merck declined comment on the article.
Last Friday, Merck acknowledged some sealed trial documents had been made public, noting that in other similar court cases documents had been leaked to advance the plaintiffs' lawyers interests.
It said that it "acted responsibly and appropriately as it developed and marketed Vioxx."
Merck shares had been trading in the $45 range until the withdrawal announcement, plunged to the mid $30s that day and have hovered just above $30 since then.
The stock price was as high as $49 per share in February and was slightly above $90 at the end of 2000, before the recession.

With Vioxx coming off the pharmacy shelves, what is a patient who took that drug for pain supposed to do?
Call the doctor who prescribed it and talk about alternatives.
But while patients need to stop taking Vioxx, local physicians said, it is not always easy to decide on a new course of treatment.
"There's not a simple generic answer," said Dr Randel Miller, Watson Clinic rheumatologist.
Merck & Co. removed Vioxx from use Thursday after new study results showed increased risk of heart attacks and stroke in people who used it for longer than 18 months.
Patients on Vioxx for arthritis or other conditions should be getting letters from their doctors, although they can call them now.
Simply switching to stronger doses of over the counter pain medicine is not necessarily the right option, doctors said.
Some of them have an anti clotting effect that make patients more likely to bleed.
For patients on blood thinners such as Coumadin, the combination could be highly risky without proper supervision.
And older nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen, typically called NSAIDs, cause gastrointestinal bleeding in some patients.
That is one reason doctors and patients welcomed the new NSAIDs known as Cox 2 inhibitors Vioxx, Celebrex and Bextra as they started entering the market in the 1990s.
Their less upsetting impact on the stomach was a plus, particularly with older patients.
Concern about possible cardiovascular problems associated with Vioxx, however, soon arose.
Dr Ada Lopez Mendez, a rheumatology specialist at Winter Haven Hospital, said patients should return the Vioxx they have.
Their doctors can prescribe other Cox 2 inhibitors, or try drugs such as ibuprofen.
They may review patients' conditions to see if they still need medicine, she and Miller said.
Two newer arthritis drugs of the same type are waiting for marketing approval in the United States, but Miller said they will not be released without more review of their cardiovascular risks.
On Wednesday, the European Medicines Agency in London announced it would review all drugs of this type.
Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the risk of an individual patient having a heart attack or stroke related to Vioxx is small, the agency also said "there appear to be significant safety concerns."
Results of clinical studies with one drug in a given class do not necessarily apply to other drugs in the same class, the FDA said.
That means Vioxx results cannot automatically be extended to Celebrex and Bextra, which are in the Cox 2 classification with Vioxx but are not identical to it.
"There's no evidence we're aware of the other Cox 2 drugs have similar effects, but we don't really have studies that are long enough (to know)," Miller said.
But articles released Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine say Vioxx may not be the only drug of its type that raises the heart and stroke risk.
Studies done five years ago when Pfizer's Celebrex and Merck & Co.'s Vioxx were approved suggest the same mechanism that inhibits inflammation and makes them easier on the stomach than traditional painkillers also blocks a substance that prevents heart problems, according to Dr Garret FitzGerald, chairman of pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania.
He led the studies, which were designed by him but funded by the drug companies.
FitzGerald said he thinks the problem of increased risk also applies to Pfizer's Celebrex and Bextra.
Pfizer's medical director, Dr Gail Cawkwell, insisted that its drugs are safe.
"The data for Celebrex is robust and exceeds, in the length of patients in studies and in the size of studies, the data Vioxx has," she said.
She called FitzGerald's contention "an interesting theory," but said, "there is no evidence" of increased risk of heart problems among the 75 million Americans who have taken Celebrex.
Long term studies are not yet available on Bextra, approved in 2001.
The FDA needs to give more guidance in using the remaining COX 2 inhibitors, Fitzgerald said in the Journal article.
He said the drugs remain a "rational choice" for patients at low risk of cardiovascular problems who have had serious gastrointestinal events (such as bleeding), but he said it would "seem prudent" to avoid them with patients who have or are at risk of cardiovascular disease.
In a separate report released by the New England Journal, Dr Eric Topol of the Cleveland Clinic chastises the FDA for not requiring Merck to do studies investigating heart problems with Vioxx when hints of them first appeared years ago.
"This represents the largest prescription drug withdrawal in history, but had the many warning signs along the way been heeded, such a debacle could have been prevented," he said.
The medical journal published their reports Wednesday on the Internet more than two weeks ahead of their planned publication to help inform doctors and patients.
Until the new study, Vioxx seemed the best alternative for some patients despite a caution on its label from an earlier study.
That included patients for whom older NSAIDs had not controlled pain and patients who have sulfa allergies, of which Celebrex and Bextra can trigger a recurrence, Watson Clinic's Miller said.
"There's a lot of individual variability in medicines," he said.
"You have one person do extremely well with a drug and on the other it wouldn't work."
The trial whose results pulled Vioxx off the market was designed to check how well 25 mg of Vioxx did in preventing recurrence of polyps in the colon.
It was not stopped earlier because trial results did not find increased risk in the first 18 months of the trial, the FDA said.
They were discovered later.
The results of that study came on the heels of an earlier study that showed a greater number of heart attacks in patients taking Vioxx, although there were fewer stomach ulcers and bleeding.
Information from the earlier study went on the Vioxx label in April 2002, according to the FDA.
Although that study's findings did not cause Vioxx to be withdrawn, Miller and Lopez Mendez said the results put Vioxx lower on their list for prescribing.
Another study this one released in August on a review of more than 1 million HMO patients found a three fold risk of cardiovascular incidents in patients taking 25 mg or more Vioxx, Lopez Mendez said.
The risk was only slightly greater than average with less than 25 milligrams, she said, adding that the American College of Rheumatology sent members the results of that presentation days before Merck withdrew Vioxx.
That could have made many less likely to prescribe it.
"When there are other alternatives, why risk trying to use the drug that might have elevated risk?" said Lopez Mendez, medical director of rehabilitation services at Winter Haven Hospital.
A study sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration estimates that Merck painkiller Vioxx, withdrawn from the market in September, could have caused 27785 heart attacks or deaths since it was approved in 1999.
The study concluded that Vioxx, known under the chemical name rofecoxib, "increases the risk of serious coronary heart disease defined as acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death," the FDA study concluded.
A high dose increased risk by 3.7 fold and standard dose by 1.5 fold compared to a rival drug produced by Pfizer, Celebrex, or celecoxib, the FDA said.
The study, published Tuesday, also suggested Merck tried to explain away signs that showed Vioxx increased the risk of heart attacks, in company sponsored clinical trials four years ago.
Merck had argued that a comparison between Vioxx and a generic anti inflammatory drug called naproxen was misleading because the latter could help protect against heart attacks or strokes.
However, the FDA study disputed that, saying naproxen showed "no protective effect" against heart attacks.
"The manufacturer attributed this difference to a never before recognized protective effect of Naproxen," said the study.
"To explain a five fold difference, Naproxen would have had to be one of the most potent and effective cardio protectants known."
On Tuesday the company described the FDA estimates as speculation: "In general, there is no reliable way to measure the actual use in the population and therefore no reliable way to estimate the actual number of events."
Merck pulled the 2.5 billion dollar a year seller Vioxx off the market on September 30 when an internal study found it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke after 18 months of continuous use.
The European Medicines Agency is to review all drugs in the same class as Vioxx after US pharmaceutical giant Merck withdrew the arthritis drug, a spokesman for the agency said Friday.
Merck announced a global withdrawal Thursday of Vioxx, a blockbuster arthritis drug, after a study showed it increased the risk of strokes and heart attacks.
"We are going to see whether there is a class effect," a spokesman for the London based agency said.
The US Food and Drug Administration also has said it would study the effects of other drugs in the same class as the withdrawn drug.
Vioxx, which is scientifically known as rofecoxib, has been marketed in more than 80 countries and produced sales of 2.5 billion dollars in 2003.
The European Medicines Agency carried out a review of the drug class which includes Vioxx known as COX 2 inhibitors at the request of French authorities, but concluded in November 2003 that the products did not need to be withdrawn from the market.
The pharmaceutical firm Merck faces a new class action lawsuit in Canada, filed on behalf of two people who suffered heart attacks after taking the company's pain medication Vioxx, which was taken off the market worldwide because of such risks, plaintiffs' lawyers said Friday.
Similar suits were filed last week in Quebec, British Columbia, Ontario and Saskatchewan, according to the Toronto law Firm Rochon Genova.
The pharmaceutical group decided on September 30 to pull its anti inflammatory drug Vioxx off the shelves after three years of clinical studies showed that there was an increased risk of stroke or heart attack after 18 months of treatment.
In 2003, some 3.4 million prescriptions for Vioxx were written in Canada, according to the law firm.
Last week, a consumer group in Quebec filed suit against Merck, charging that it kept Vioxx on the market despite the risks.
Anti inflammatory drugs like Vioxx, which is being pulled off the market after it was linked to cardiac problems, could pose similar riskald of the University of Pennsylvania, who led one of the studies funded by the two pharmaceutical firms.
"I believe this is a class effect" that includes similar types of medication, such as Celebrex or Bextra, FitzGerald said.
Bextra, which hit the market in 2001, is Pfizer's newest pain medication.
He urged the FDA to change information on packages to warn patients and doctors of the risks.
Pfizer's medical director, Gail Cawkwell, said in a statement that "the data for Celebrex is robust and exceeds, in the length of patients in studies and in the size of studies, the data Vioxx has."
Last week's decision by Merck to halt sales of Vioxx, its blockbuster painkiller, could lead to an onslaught of new lawsuits against the company.
Hundreds and perhaps thousands of new Vioxx lawsuits are likely to be filed, lawyers said, with many of them class actions that aim to represent large groups of Vioxx users who have taken the drug for extended periods.
Indeed, radio advertisements seeking plaintiffs are being broadcast and some suits were filed almost immediately after Merck's recall announcement on Thursday.
"Our lawsuit was in the works but the filing was accelerated by the recall," said Don S. Strong, a lawyer who filed a suit against Merck on Thursday in U.S.District Court in Oklahoma City.
"The recall makes our burden of proof easier," Strong said, "because it validates what our experts have been telling us for several months."
The lawsuit says that Strong's client suffered ministrokes and a number of heart problems from taking Vioxx.
But some experienced product liability lawyers say a new wave of litigation may not necessarily be more distracting for Merck than the suits that are already working their way through the courts.
Assuming the Vioxx cases follow the pattern of other major product liability battles, a surge in lawsuits could well encourage court ordered consolidation of the litigation, hastening its resolution.
Whether the decision to recall the product ends up undermining Merck's legal defenses or improving its image to juries is less predictable, according to legal experts.
"Both sides will try to spin this in their favor," said Vincent S. Walkowiak, a Dallas lawyer who has worked for Merck in other cases but is not involved in the Vioxx litigation.
"The plaintiffs will say this is confirmation of Vioxx's dangers and Merck will use it to establish that it is behaving responsibly."
While declining to comment directly on the legal impact of Vioxx's withdrawal, Theodore V.H. Mayer, a lawyer at Hughes Hubbard & Reed, a firm retained by Merck, said the company "continues to believe it has strong and meritorious defenses to the lawsuits brought against it."
Hundreds of lawsuits had been filed against Merck, which is based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., long before last week's recall decision.
The lawsuits blame Vioxx currently used by about 1.3 million Americans and 700000 arthritis sufferers in other countries for heart attacks, strokes and other health problems.
They also charge that Merck's aggressive marketing of Vioxx failed to disclose adequately the information the company had about those risks and that Merck did not diligently pursue research into the hazards of Vioxx.
Some of the lawsuits include drug distributors and doctors as co defendants.
The decision to recall Vioxx could have an impact on whether the drug is found to be defective, according to Walkowski.
Some states have statutes that create a presumption that there is no defect in drugs and drug labels that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, Vioxx had such approval.
It is unclear, though, whether courts will rule that the Vioxx recall eliminates such presumptions.
If Vioxx is found to be defective under certain state laws, the timing and the circumstances of the recall could become a factor in determining whether Merck behaved so negligently or recklessly that it should pay punitive damages.
State laws will be used to determine liability, regardless of whether a case is in state or federal court.
"It frames the issue for a jury," Walkowiak said.
Merck announced that it would withdraw Vioxx from the market after it learned on Sept 23 that the drug's users were twice as likely to suffer heart attacks or strokes as test subjects receiving a placebo.
The data came to light in a major clinical trial that Merck had hoped would show that Vioxx could help prevent colon polyps, which can become cancerous.
Merck had contested all previous reports that Vioxx was dangerous, contending they were based on faulty or inconclusive research.
Several lawsuits have been filed since Thursday, including a class action against Merck Frosst, the Canadian subsidiary of Merck, brought by a consumers' group in Quebec.
Some lawyers, including those who had filed suits against Merck before the Vioxx withdrawal, said that they already had plenty of evidence of the drug's dangers before last week's announcement.
"The evidence is no better," said Robert E. Cartwright Jr., a San Francisco lawyer whose lawsuits against Merck are among approximately 285 similar cases that have been consolidated before a single California state judge in Los Angeles.
"It was just a matter of time before the recall occurred," said Cartwright, whose first case was filed in March 2002.
One Vioxx case brought by a plaintiff in Alabama is scheduled for trial in December.
The withdrawal of Vioxx leaves numerous unanswered questions about the extent of the risks it poses.
Some plaintiffs could ask Merck to finance more research into the effects of the drug.
The most serious health risks associated with Vioxx seem to appear after consumers have been taking the drug for 18 months or longer.
Merck said Monday that it was still looking into how many Vioxx users fell into that group.
More than 105 million Vioxx prescriptions have been filled for about 20 million consumers since the drug was first sold in August 1999, according to the company.
Vioxx's $2.5 billion in sales accounted for about 11 percent of Merck's revenue last year and, according to analysts' estimates, about $1.2 billion, or 18 percent, of its earnings.
The crucial role Vioxx plays in Merck's portfolio was apparent last week when Merck's shares plunged 27 percent to $33 after the withdrawal announcement.
Since then, shares of Merck have rebounded modestly.
They rose 92 cents Monday, to $34.23.
Hundreds of plaintiffs' lawyers who claim that people were injured or killed by the painkiller Vioxx plan to meet next week to lay groundwork for a nationwide legal assault against the drug's maker, Merck.
The lawyers expect the discussions to begin informally on Tuesday in Pasadena, Calif., in the hallways of a conference on Vioxx litigation that will also be open to defense lawyers.
On Thursday, at a meeting in Las Vegas for the plaintiffs' lawyers only, those who are suing Merck, or plan to, expect to discuss specific strategies.
"We can't compete with big pharmaceutical companies by ourselves, but when we get together, we can become formidable," said Daniel E. Becnel Jr., a lawyer in Reserve, La., who has led such organizational efforts in other drug cases and in tobacco litigation.
"This is a case that needs to be managed by the premier lawyers in the country."
J. Michael Papantonio, a lawyer in Pensacola, Fla., who organized the Las Vegas meeting, said about 500 plaintiffs' lawyers were expected to attend.
Even before Merck pulled Vioxx from the market on Sept 30, citing what it said was new evidence that the drug increased the risk of heart attacks, strokes and other serious ailments, hundreds of patients had filed lawsuits around the country.
Since then, countless other lawsuits have been brought no one yet has an accurate figure and more are expected.
Merck, which has said it pulled the drug as soon as it had conclusive evidence of unacceptable risk, declined to discuss its defense strategy.
This week, the incentives to sue have multiplied.
The Food and Drug Administration published a report on its Web site on Tuesday by a staff researcher, concluding that more than 27000 deaths could be attributed to Vioxx based on comparisons with how patients taking other painkillers had fared.
On Thursday, the Lancet, a respected British medical journal, published an analysis of all the clinical trials of Vioxx completed by 2001, and concluded that Merck and the FDA should have known enough about the drug's hazards to withdraw it years ago.
The plaintiffs' lawyers plan to compare notes next week on the types of clients who may make the strongest cases, with a premium on people who were in demonstrably good health before taking Vioxx.
The group also intends to discuss ways to cooperate in gathering evidence and expert testimony, and in devising tactics to influence where the bulk of the cases may end up, as state and federal judges consolidate them.
Until such matters are resolved, how soon any of the cases may come to trial is uncertain, including one that had been expected to begin as early as next month in federal court in Birmingham, Ala.
Many lawyers will also be jockeying for roles that will maximize their influence, and ultimately their reimbursement, as the litigation unfolds.
More than 20 million Americans have used Vioxx since it went on the market in 1999.
Millions more used the drug overseas.
Based on the number of Vioxx customers and the seriousness of the injuries, the Vioxx lawsuits would appear to have the potential to dwarf recent cases like the one against Baycol, a cholesterol lowering drug used by about 700000 Americans, and the one against the diet supplement fen phen, which an estimated 6 million people took.
Baycol's maker, the Bayer Group of Germany, said in late September that it had paid $1.09 billion to settle 2861 lawsuits and that 7577 suits were pending.
And Wyeth, the marketer of fen phen, faces continuing legal battles with plaintiffs who opted out of a settlement program that pays victims from a $3.75 billion trust fund.
Wyeth has set aside $16.6 billion to cover its liabilities.
Many plaintiffs' lawyers say it is too early to make a realistic assessment of Merck's financial vulnerability.
Merck, the nation's second largest drugmaker, has long been among the nation's strongest companies financially, with a credit rating among the highest in American business.
In their meetings next week, the lawyers are likely to weigh the potential impact of this week's national elections, which strengthened the Republican led effort to curb product liability lawsuits.
A related concern for the plaintiffs' lawyers is the FDA's continuing efforts under the Bush administration to persuade judges that FDA approval of a drug, along with warnings on the label, should go a long way toward shielding the maker from lawsuits.
So far, most state judges have rejected the FDA immunity argument.
But if courts began to accept it or Congress made it the law of the land plaintiffs' lawyers would have the higher hurdle of arguing that Merck deceived the FDA by hiding or distorting damaging data.
That case would be hard to make without supportive testimony from the agency, some lawyers said.
The personal injury lawsuits or tort cases, as lawyers call them can be filed in state or federal courts and in many cases name other parties, like doctors or drug distributor, as co defendants with Merck.
In the hundreds of Vioxx lawsuits filed before Merck took the drug off the market, the action was primarily in New Jersey, where Merck is based, and the big states of Texas and California.
But the financial burden of taking on a giant like Merck while it continued to insist that Vioxx was safe and effective scared away many lawyers.
"It's been a quiet little mass tort for a long time," said Carlene Rhodes Lewis, a Houston lawyer whose firm was among the pioneers when it began filing Vioxx complaints in 2001.
Lewis and her partners took on nearly 300 such cases by the time Merck pulled the plug on Vioxx.
Merck's withdrawal of Vioxx has made it much easier for lawyers to argue to a jury that the product should not have been on the market.
But proving liability could still be difficult.
The data from clinical studies suggest, so far, that the most serious health problems hit patients who had used Vioxx for 18 months or longer.
Merck has said it does not know yet how large that group is.
In addition, many possible Vioxx victims may find it difficult to pin their health problems on the drug if forced to go to trial, lawyers who filed the early cases said.
The injuries linked to Vioxx are also common among people who have not used the drug, and they have many causes.
"The person who should never have taken Vioxx and should have been warned by Merck, the person with multiple risks of cardiac problems, may not make the best client, because it may be harder to prove that Vioxx caused the heart attack," said Cynthia Anne Solomon, a lawyer in Mt.
Pleasant, S.C. As a result, the pioneering plaintiffs' lawyers in the Vioxx litigation have been carefully screening potential clients in search of those who were relatively healthy before they took the drug and suffered injuries.
Some of those lawyers said they were worried that lawyers who rushed into the field after Merck withdrew the drug, including law firms soliciting clients with radio and print advertising, will muddy the legal landscape with questionable claims.
"For every hundred calls we get, there are only two or three top end cases," Papantonio said.
He and others said that Merck, if it follows the course of other drug companies in similar situations, is likely to try to settle the strongest cases against it and fight some of the weaker claims in trials.
If it wins those trials, it could knock down the settlement value of the vast majority of claims against it and cut billions of dollars from its potential exposure.
Merck recently asked the panel of judges that supervises the way mass torts are handled in federal courts to assign all of the lawsuits to one judge.
Becnel filed a similar petition.
The panel is expected to hear arguments on the petitions and where the cases should be consolidated at its January meeting.
Many lawyers involved in the lawsuits say the federal consolidation process should hasten final settlement of most of the Vioxx cases.
The state cases in New Jersey and California have already gone through such a process.
But the effort to centralize the federal cases while sorting out which cases will remain in state courts where plaintiffs' lawyers usually prefer them could very likely lead to procedure battles that may delay the first Vioxx trials.
Several were on course to begin in the next few months.
"It's up in air now," said Andy D. Birchfield Jr., a lawyer in Montgomery, Ala., who had expected to begin trying a Vioxx case in federal court in Birmingham as soon as next month.
Net income plunged 29 percent for pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. in the third quarter due to costs for withdrawing its arthritis drug Vioxx from the market, and the company on Thursday said hundreds of lawsuits have been filed related to the drug.
Merck, one of the world's top five drug makers, said Thursday it earned $1.33 billion (euro1.06 billion), or 60 cents (48 euro cents) per share.
That was down from $1.86 billion, or 82 cents per share, in the July September period of 2003.
It said unsold Vioxx inventory, estimated customer returns and costs to pull the blockbuster drug from the market worldwide totaled $552.6 million (euro438.4 million) in the third quarter.
That's despite the fact that the company did not announce until the final day of the third quarter that it was withdrawing Vioxx, a popular treatment for arthritis and acute pain, because a study found it increased risk of heart attack and stroke.
Revenues for the third quarter totaled $5.54 billion (euro4.39 billion), down 4 percent from $5.76 billion in the year ago quarter.
Because of lost revenues for Vioxx, which had about $2.5 billion in 2003 sales, or 11 percent of total company revenues, Merck said Thursday that fourth quarter earnings per share will only be 48 cents (38 euro cents) to 53 cents (42 euro cents), with full year earnings per share at $2.59 to $2.64 (euro2.05 to euro2.09).
Last month, Merck had said the Vioxx recall would slash 50 cents to 60 cents off its earnings per share for the year, on Thursday, it said the impact would be 50 cents to 55 cents.
For the first nine months of the year, net income declined to $4.71 billion (euro3.74 billion), or $2.11 (euro1.67) per share, from $5.44 billion, or $2.41 per share.
Revenues inched up to $17.19 billion (euro13.64 billion) from $16.86 billion in the January September period of 2003.

Norway on Tuesday followed the United States, the European Union and India in recalling its ambassador in Nepal to protest King Gyanendra's seizure of absolute power.
"In light of the latest developments in Nepal, the Norwegian ambassador Tore Toreng has been recalled today (Tuesday) for consultations," the Norwegian foreign ministry said in a statement.
On February 1, Nepal's King Gyanendra sacked the government, claiming it had failed to quell a Maoist insurgency that has claimed more than 11000 lives since 1996.
He then appointed a pro royalist cabinet headed by himself and declared a state of emergency in the Himalayan kingdom.
Responding to the move, the Maoist rebels have declared a general blockade, which they say will continue until Gyanendra reverses his actions, and the Nepalese army has been put on high alert.
The dissolution of the Nepalese government is a "serious setback for democracy," Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen said in the statement.
Norway, which is not an EU member, also implied that it might freeze aid to Nepal if the situation there does not improve.
The White House said Monday that it had "real concerns" about over the February 1 power grab by Nepal's King Gyanendra and urged him to enact democratic reforms.
"We have real concerns about the steps back from democracy that have been taken in Nepal," said spokesman Scott McClellan.
"We will continue to make our views known to the government in Nepal."
Gyanendra, who controls the army, last week fired the government for failing to organise elections and for failing to end the Maoist insurgency, named a loyalist cabinet under his chairmanship, declared a state of emergency and pledged to restore multi party democracy in three years.
In the meantime scores of political leaders, party and union leaders are under arrest, press censorship has been imposed and any criticism of the king's action has been banned.
"We urge everybody to continue to move forward on democratic reforms, and that includes the government of Nepal.
It is a concern, the steps that they have taken," said McClellan.
Washington provides Nepal's army with badly needed weapons and training in its fight against Maoist rebels, considered by Washington as terrorists.
The revolt has claimed more than 11000 lives since 1996.
Japan on Monday extended 17.1 million dollars in aid to Nepal while urging King Gyanendra to return the country to democracy.
The Japanese government announced the non military aid in a statement here that also said Tokyo was "strongly urging that political leaders be released and that freedom guaranteed by the constitutional be restored promptly."
Tokyo "believes that strengthening of the democratization process under a system of democracy and a constitutional monarchy will facilitate a sustainable development in Nepal," the Japanese statement said.
"Japan also urge the Maoists to achieve peace through dialogue," it added.
The announcement came after Nepal's Finance Minister Madhukar Shumsher Rana said international donors want Gyanendra to end emergency rule in the aid dependent kingdom before promising continued development support.
Last month Gyanendra dismissed the impoverished country's government, imposed emergency rule and suspended civil liberties, saying he did so to tackle a nine year Maoist revolt that has claimed more than 11000 lives.
Nepal relies on international donor aid and loans for more than half its development budget.
Its economy has been in growing shambles amid the mounting revolt which has scared away tourists, another major income source for the Himalayan nation.
An envoy of Nepalese King Gyanendra Sunday met Indian Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran and briefed him about the situation in the Himalayan kingdom, almost a month after the monarch sacked the government and seized absolute power, a report said.
The Press Trust of India news agency said Sharad Chandra Shah, a close aide of Gyanendra, is in New Delhi to attend a conference but also used the opportunity to clear the air of "misapprehensions".
Saran explained the need for immediate restoration of the democratic process in Nepal, the report said.
Nepal wanted India to show "greater understanding" to its sensitivities, saying King Gyanendra needed time to restore the democratic process, the report said.
Indian foreign ministry officials were unavailable for comment.
Gyanendra Thursday promised to restore democracy in the Himalayan kingdom in the next three years.
He said sacking the government had been a last resort.
India has been sharply critical of the king's appointing a pro royalist cabinet headed by himself and declaring a state of emergency in the Himalayan kingdom on February 1.
India, along with the United States and Britain, has been an important backer of Nepal in its drive to crush a Maoist insurgency that has sapped the economy of one of the poorest countries in the world.
India, which shares a nearly 1600 kilometer (990 mile) border with the Himalayan kingdom, is concerned the Maoist violence in Nepal, which has claimed 11000 lives since 1996, could spill into Indian states where radical leftist groups are powerful.
On Tuesday, India and Britain announced a suspension of military aid to Nepal.
Nepal, facing growing world pressure to free political detainees, freed Thursday eight party leaders and activists arrested after King Gyanendra's power takeover, a party official said.
Among those released were former state foreign affairs minister Prakash Sharan Mahat, who was a member of the four party coalition government dismissed by Gyanendra February 1.
"Eight political leaders and activists were released on Wednesday," Bhanubhakta Dhakal, an official of the Nepal Communist Party United Marxist and Leninist, told AFP: Others freed included student leaders and former lawmakers.
But two former prime ministers Girija Prasad Koirala, Nepal's first elected prime minister, and Sher Bahadur Deuba, who was fired by the king when he seized power, remained under house arrest.
King Gyanendra seized control of Nepal on February 1, firing the government, imposing emergency rule and vowing to tackle an increasingly bloody Maoist revolt that has claimed 11000 lives since 1996.
He has given himself three years to restore peace and democracy.
Rights groups say over 400 activists are in detention or under house arrest.
But Nepal's royal appointed foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey said in New Delhi that "very few people are in detention."
Word of the release of the eight came after the World Bank said late Wednesday it was freezing release of more aid to Nepal, while it assessed events on the ground including protection of human rights.
Nepal relies on international donor aid and loans for more than half its development budget to prop up an economy devastated by the Maoist insurgency.
Last month, India and Britain suspended military aid to help Nepal's ill equipped army battle the Maoists and called for the king to restore democracy.
The United States is mulling similar action.
India has told the king to mend fences with Nepal's politial parties, saying Gyanendra's move had only served to deepen the crisis facing the country.
Nepal's media has been "suffocated" through a climate of fear and self censorship since King Gyanendra seized power, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) said Thursday.
In a statement issued by the Brussels based organisation during a visit to Kathmandu by its president, Christopher Warren, the IFJ said journalists' fear for their safety were among the factors "crippling" democracy in Nepal.
"Since King Gyanendra's royal coup on February 1, he and his army have suffocated the media by directly enforcing censorship through armed military intervention and indirectly fostering a climate of fear and self censorship," Warren said in the statement.
"As a result of this sweeping censorship, media organisations have been sh to visit Misturi in the past week and found him to be "very well, healthy", and keen to renew his anti government protests if released by a court.
Nine UN human rights experts on Tuesday expressed deep concern at King Gyanendra's seizure of power in Nepal last week and called for the restoration of democracy.
The arrest of political figures extended from the whole cabinet all the way down to middle level party workers and student leaders, while the military was running all media outfits in the country, the group warned.
"We are deeply concerned at the actions taken by King Gyanendra of Nepal to dissolve the constitutional government ,and to assume direct power," the experts said in a joint statement.
"The wave of arrests and detentions, and the actions against the media are a serious setback for the country.
"We consider that steps should be taken to reinstall democratic institutions and to protect Nepalese citizens and their representatives, as well as human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers and political leaders," they added.
Human rights activists and critics of the regime were caught in the clampdown and some had gone into hiding to avoid arrest, the experts said.
The nine included UN special rapporteurs on torture, freedom of expression, arbitrary detention, involuntary disappearances and the independence of the judiciary.
US ambassador to Nepal James Moriarity has been asked to return to Washington for consultations, the State Department said Monday, two weeks after the country's monarch sacked the government, declared a state of emergency, and took absolute power.
In a statement, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher decried the deteriorating conditions in Nepal, including the arrests of several pro democracy activists, since the February 1 power grab by King Gyanendra.
"We remain deeply troubled by developments in Nepal," Boucher said in a statement.
"King Gyanendra's dismissal of the government, declaration of a state of emergency, detention of politicians, human rights workers and students and the suspension of fundamental constitutional rights is a step away from Nepal's path toward democracy."
During a weeklong stay in Washington, Boucher said, Moriarty will meet with US officials to assess developments in Nepal, while the US government "considers what steps we will take to support the Nepalese people's quest for democracy, peace, security and development.
He will then return to Nepal," Boucher said.
"The United States supports a peaceful, prosperous and democratic Nepal," the spokesman continued.
"We call on those in Nepal who are committed to the country's future to engage in meaningful political discussions leading to national elections," said Boucher.
Nepalese Foreign Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey held talks with Indian External Affairs Minister K Natwar Singh here on Monday to discuss the political developments in the Himalayan Kingdom.
Pandey, who is on a three day working visit, is trying to allay New Delhi's apprehensions over the sacking of Sher Bahadur Deuba Government, imposition of emergency and detention of political leaders by King Gyanendra.
This is the first official high level visit to India since Nepalese King Gyanendra reshuffled the cabinet on Feb 2.
Pandey is accompanied by Foreign Secretary Madhuraman Acharya and other senior officials of the ministry.
"The visit is related to the current political situation in Nepal," the Press Trust of India quoted a Nepalese official as saying.
India has criticized Gyanendra's action and suspended since February 1 all military aid to the Kingdom engaged in fighting anti govenrment insurgency.
Nepal's foreign minister met his Indian counterpart in New Delhi Monday in the first ministerial contact between the neighbours since King Gyanendra seized power in the Himalayan kingdom.
Nepalese Foreign Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey arrived here early Monday on a three day working visit, a foreign ministry official said.
He held talks over lunch with Indian Foreign Minister Natwar Singh.
Pandey, appointed to his post by Gyanendra, was accompanied by a delegation that included foreign secretary Madhu Raman Acharya.
"The visit is related to the current political situation in Nepal," the Press Trust of India news agency quoted an unnamed Nepalese official as saying.
The visit to New Delhi is Pandey's first trip outside Nepal since the king who assumed absolute power by dismissing the government on February 1.
Gyanendra imposed emergency rule and suspended civil liberties, saying he was forced to act to tackle a nine year Maoist revolt that has claimed more than 11000 lives.
India has strongly condemned Gyanendra's power grab and urged an immediate restoration of democracy in the country.
It has joined Britain in cutting off military aid to the Nepal, which is heavily dependent on foreign support for the battle that it has been waging since 1996 against the Maoist insurgents.
India, which shares a nearly 1600 kilometer (990 mile) border with the Himalayan kingdom, is also concerned Maoist violence in Nepal could spill into Indian states where radical leftist groups are powerful.
Pandey's visit follows a visit to New Delhi last month by Sharad Chandra Shah, a close aide of Gyanendra.
Shah, who met Indian Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran, said Nepal wanted India to show "greater understanding" of its problems, adding King Gyanendra needed time to restore democracy.
Gyanendra has said he will restore democracy and peace in the kingdom, nestled between India and China, in three years.
Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz on Thursday had a telephonic conversation with King Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev of Nepal, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Matters relating to the holding of the 13th South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Summit as well as Pakistan Nepal relations were discussed, the spokesman said in a press release issued here on Thursday.
King Gyanendra shared Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz's disappointment over the postponement of the SAARC Summit and expressed full confidence in Pakistan to set up new dates for the summit and assured that he would certainly come to represent Nepal at the summit, the spokesman said.
Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz is the current chairman of SAARC.
The prime minister conveyed to King Gyanendra that recent developments in Nepal were its internal matter, the spokesman said.
Pakistan strictly adheres to the principles of non intervention on and non interference in the internal affairs of states and Pakistan has consistently upheld these principles, Shaukat Aziz said.
The prime minister also assured King Gyanendra of Pakistan's support for the unity, sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of the Kingdom of Nepal.
Pakistan and Nepal share the objective of combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, the spokesman said, adding Pakistan will continue to assist Nepal in the economic, social and technical fields.
The United States said Tuesday it was "deeply troubled" by an apparent setback to democracy in Nepal, where King Gyanendra has dismissed the government and imposed a state of emergency.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on Tuesday expressed deep concern over events in Nepal and urged a return to democracy, after King Gyanendra dismissed the country's coalition government and imposed an indefinite state of emergency.
"The secretary general is deeply concerned at the actions taken by the constitutional monarchy in Nepal on Tuesday to dissolve the government, impose a state of emergency and suspend civil liberties and freedom of expression," UN spokesman Fred Eckhard said in a statement.
The European Union on Wednesday joined international condemnation of Nepalese King Gyanendra's dismissal of his government and swearing in of a new cabinet dominated by royalists.
The EU's Luxembourg presidency called for a "speedy" return to multi party democracy.
"The EU is deeply concerned about the dissolution of the multiparty government in Nepal and the decision by the king to assume executive powers," it said in a statement.
"This represents a serious setback to multiparty democracy.
The EU has consistently supported multiparty democracy and constitutional monarchy in Nepal," it said.
Gyanendra said he fired the government of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba for failing to hold elections or to bring peace to a country racked by an increasingly deadly Maoist revolt.
The monarch, vaulted to the throne four years ago by a palace massacre that wiped out most of the royal family, pledged to "restore democracy and law and order in the country in the next three years."
The EU said this was not good enough.
"In the present situation, the EU sees no alternative to a broad based government,The EU calls for the speedy restoration of multiparty democracy in Nepal to better meet the aspirations of the Nepalese people," it said.
"The EU continues to judge that there can be no acceptable military solution to Nepal's problems and that any search for a solution by military means by either side will only add to and prolong the suffering of the Nepalese people."
China respects the choice of Nepalese in developing their own country and sincerely wishes the nation to realize social security, economic development and ethnic pacification, Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan told a regular press conference here Tuesday.
He made this remark when asked to comment on Nepal's King Gyanendra's Tuesday announcement of dissolving the coalition government led by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and forming a new government under his own "chairmanship".
Calling this decision "an internal affair of Nepal," Kong said that China will respect Nepalese people's option on how to develop their own country.
Deuba was appointed prime minister by Gyanendra on June 2, 2004, and sworn in on July 5, 2004.
The British government expressed grave concerns Tuesday about political developments in Nepal, after the king dismissed the prime minister and declared a state of emergency.
Foreign Office Minister Douglas Alexander summoned the Nepalese ambassador in London and conveyed Britain's concern at King Gyanendra's actions.
"I am extremely concerned to hear of the king of Nepal's dismissal of his prime minister this morning," said Alexander.
"This action will increase the risk of instability in Nepal, undermining the institutions of democracy and constitutional monarchy in the country.
We call for the immediate restitution of multiparty democracy, and appeal for calm and restraint on all sides during this difficult time."
It was the second time in three years that the king has taken control of the tiny South Asian constitutional monarchy, a throwback to the era of absolute power enjoyed by Nepal's monarchs before King Birendra, Gyanendra's elder brother, introduced democracy in 1990.
King Gyanendra denied his takeover was a coup, although soldiers surrounded the houses of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and other government leaders.
Telephone and Internet lines were snapped, flights diverted and civil liberties severely curtailed.
A power grab by Nepal's King Gyanendra provoked condemnation from his most influential allies, the United States and India, but China remained neutral a sign of Beijing's growing ties with the Himalayan nation, some analysts say.
Beijing said Gyanendra's move to dismiss the government and impose a state of emergency in Nepal last Tuesday was an "internal matter."
China's reaction, coupled with a recent move by Gyanendra to close the Nepal office of the Tibetan spiritual leader in exile, the Dalai Lama whom Beijing despises and labels a dangerous separatist has prompted speculation among Indian analysts that the king wants to enlist China's support in fighting the Maoist rebels.
Gyanendra "must have factored in China into his calculations," said Kalim Bahadur, a Nepal expert and retired professor of international relations in New Delhi.
"Any intelligent ruler in Nepal would try to take advantage of its strategic position," he said.
"And Gyanendra is a clever man."
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan said on Thursday he had no information on whether Nepal a mountainous nation sandwiched between India and China had asked for Beijing's help in the fight against the rebels, but he was quick to condemn the guerrillas.
Although Nepal's Maoist rebels claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, Beijing has long distanced itself from the insurgents.
"They steal the name ,(of) China's great leader, Mao Zedong.
We feel angry," Kong said.
He added that as "a close neighbor of Nepal, China considers its peace and stability most important."
S.D. Muni, a former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said Beijing has become increasingly concerned by growing U.S. Nepal ties, which the government of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba dismissed by Gyanendra on Tuesday had actively sought.
"They (the Chinese) viewed Deuba as too close to India and the United States," he said.
The closing of the Dalai Lama's office and a recent crackdown on Tibetan refugees both at the instigation of the king could reflect closer ties with Beijing, Muni said.
Communist troops marched into Tibet in 1950.
Beijing says it has been part of China for centuries and has spent decades trying to suppress pro independence sentiment.
In the past, Katmandu had been tolerant of Tibetans fleeing China's communist rule, with thousands of them settling there.
Gyanendra's shift toward China echoes similar moves his father, King Mahendra, made in the 1960s.
Mahendra, himself an absolute monarch, also sought to forge closer ties with China to counter India's dominance in the Himalayan kingdom.
At the time, Beijing was eager for improved relations with Nepal as a wedge against India with whom it fought a brief border war in 1962.
But if the king hopes to get China on board against the rebels, he'll have to do so without offending Nepal's biggest backers India and the United States, both of which have strongly criticized Gyanendra's power play.
The United States has given Katmandu millions of dollars in military and development aid since Nepal signed on to Washington's war on terror following the Sept 11, 2001 attacks.
So far, the Americans haven't made any decision on the continuation of aid.
"It's a fluid situation," said David Kennedy, spokesman at U.S. Embassy in New Delhi.
Kennedy said the U.S. ambassador met the king's newly appointed foreign minister and conveyed Washington's "concerns about the setback to democracy in Nepal."
India has also held off commenting on the status of military aid to Nepal and has established contacts with the new government.
New Delhi wants to secure its border and minimize links between Nepal's rebels and its own Maoist insurgents.
India's interests in the Himalayan nation actually go beyond strategic concerns, drawing from the two neighbors' historical ties, and it is unlikely to back away from support for Nepal in its fight against the Maoist rebels.
"India will try to engage the king.
It will not do anything dramatic," said Udai Bhaskar at the New Delhi based Institute of Defense and Strategic Analysis.
The leader of Nepal, King Gyanendra, unexpectedly dissolved the government and claimed absolute power Tuesday, justifying the moves as necessary to restore peace and democracy in the face of a Maoist insurgency that has spread to nearly every corner of the picturesque Himalayan nation.
Political opponents described the action as a coup.
International air service was suspended, phone and Internet connections were cut and the army was reported to be patrolling streets in the capital of Katmandu.
Security personnel surrounded the home of the prime minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, according to news agency reports.
In a rare televised address, Gyanendra, 58, said he had decided to dissolve the government the second time he has done so in the past three years because it had failed in its duty to hold parliamentary elections or end the Maoist rebellion.
He said he would form a new cabinet under his leadership and vowed to restore "effective democracy within the next three years."
But the king also imposed a state of emergency and suspended a number of constitutional liberties, including the rights to free speech, assembly and privacy, according a statement that was summarized by the Associated Press.
Taken together, the moves added to the sense in the region that Nepal is in a downward spiral, with no clear path toward repairing its dysfunctional politics or bringing an end to the violence that has claimed an estimated 10000 lives since the Maoists launched their "people's war" in 1996.
Gyanendra's announcement poses a policy challenge for the United States, which has provided Nepali security forces with about $22 million in light weaponry and other forms of military aid during the past several years.
Human rights groups have condemned both sides in the conflict for widespread abuses, but U.S. officials have justified the aid on the grounds that without it, the Maoists might win and Nepal could join the roster of failed states hospitable to terrorism.
In Katmandu this afternoon, the U.S. Embassy issued a statement expressing concern at the "apparent setback for democracy" and said its diplomats would be "consulting with Washington" on an appropriate response.
The conflict is also of deep concern to neighboring India, which is waging its own struggle against Maoist rebels some with links to the Nepali insurgents in a number of eastern states and has provided Nepal with military aid.
In a strongly worded statement Tuesday, India's Foreign Ministry condemned Gyanendra's announcement as "a serious setback to the cause of democracy in Nepal" and "a cause of grave concern."
With no phone or Internet links to Katmandu, details of the situation there were sketchy.
A New Delhi based Western diplomat who spoke with a colleague in Katmandu Tuesday afternoon said the colleague had described the city as "relatively calm," with streets filled with traffic and shops operating normally.
But the mood was clearly tense.
Anticipating possible unrest, residents formed long lines at grocery stores and gas stations to stock up on supplies, and armored vehicles with mounted machine guns patrolled the streets, news agencies reported.
Against that backdrop, some international air carriers canceled their flights into the capital, while others were turned back by Nepalese authorities before they could land.
For the past two centuries, Gyanendra's family has dominated Nepal, a country of 25 million people that is as impoverished as it is breathtaking.
The king's action Tuesday effectively restored the monarchy to the position of absolute power it occupied before Gyanendra's elder brother, King Birendra, established democracy in 1990.
Nepal's King Gyanendra named a new Cabinet Wednesday, a day after dismissing the government and declaring absolute power in a surprise move that he said was aimed at restoring democracy and ending a nine year Maoist rebellion.
Contact with the outside world remained limited and telephone and Internet service, severed on Tuesday, had yet to be fully restored.
Dozens of politicians have been arrested and many others have gone into hiding, an opposition politician told the Associated Press.
Soldiers and riot police patrolled the capital, Katmandu.
There were no reports of serious unrest, however, and international flights to Katmandu resumed on a limited basis.
Traffic was moving normally in the crowded capital and most shops were open, according to news reports.
State radio said that Gyanendra would head the 10 member Cabinet but gave few other details.
"The king has expressed confidence that everyone will support and cooperate with the new Cabinet," the palace said in a statement.
In announcing his decision on Tuesday, Gyanendra said he was dissolving the government and firing the prime minister for the second time in three years because the government had failed in its duty to hold parliamentary elections and curb the Maoist insurgency, in which about 10000 people have died.
He vowed to restore democracy in three years.
Nepal's new home minister, Dan Bahadur Shahi, who was sworn in on Wednesday, said the government would soon begin laying the groundwork for resuming peace talks with the Maoists.
"The king has the chief executive authority now, so it will be easier for the rebels to come for peace talks," Shahi said on state radio.
"It is what they have been wanting."
Gyanendra's power grab has been widely condemned by Nepal's allies, including the United States, Britain and India, all of which have been providing the government with various forms of aid in its struggle against the rebels.
India's Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would not attend a regional summit in Bangladesh, where Gyanendra had been planning to represent Nepal.
Bangladesh postponed the summit in response.
In addition to dissolving the government, Gyanendra suspended a number of key civil liberties, including freedom of the press.
Such measures "put the Nepalese people at even greater risk of human rights abuses," said a statement issued jointly by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists.
Japan, the top donor to aid dependent Nepal, on Thursday voiced concern at King Gyanendra's power grab and urged him to restore democracy and release any detained political leaders.
Joining a chorus of international condemnation over the king's sacking of the government, Japan said it hoped "Nepal will recover its peace and stability as soon as possible on the basis of democracy and constitutional monarchy."
"If political leaders are being detained, the government of Japan is deeply concerned about the situation and strongly urges that they be released and that the freedom guaranteed by the constitution restored promptly," a foreign ministry statement said.
Japan also urged Maoist rebels fighting to overthrow the monarchy "to achieve peace through dialogue."
Japan gave Nepal close to four billion yen (38.5 million dollars) in grant aid in the 2003 fiscal year and the following year relieved 21 billion yen (202.5 million dollars) of its debt, the Japanese government says.
King Gyanendra on Tuesday sacked prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba for the second time in three years and assumed control.
He accused elected leaders of failing to control the Maoist uprising which has claimed some 11000 lives since 1996.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday struggled to assess the morality and propriety of states' executing murderers who killed at age 16 or 17 the ultimate punishment carried out in few places outside the United States.
The court has outlawed executions for those 15 and under when they committed their crimes.
Still, 19 of 50 states allow the death penalty for those older teenage killers.
Justices debated whether such killers are children who cannot grasp the consequences of their actions and should be kept from death row, or criminals whose executions would ensure justice for victims and deter other youths.
The justices seemed sharply aware of the world audience as they discussed whether the executions are cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Constitution.
They heard arguments in a Missouri case involving Christopher Simmons, who at 17 kidnapped a neighbor and threw her off a bridge.
Juvenile offenders have been put to death in recent years in just a few other countries, including Iran, Pakistan, China and Saudi Arabia.
All those countries have gone on record as opposing capital punishment for minors.
"We are literally alone in the world," said Seth Waxman, Simmons' lawyer.
Justices repeatedly referred to arguments filed on behalf of Simmons by foreign leaders, Nobel Peace Prize winners and former U.S. diplomats.
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a moderate expected to be a key swing vote, said that with world opinion against the punishment, "Does that have a bearing on what's unusual?"
James Layton, representing the state of Missouri, said the court's judgment about unconstitutional punishment in America "should not be based on what happens in the rest of the world."
"Is there some special reason why what happens abroad would not be relevant here?"
Justice Stephen Breyer asked.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, quoting from the U.S. Declaration of Independence, said that for the United States to lead, it must "show a decent respect for the opinions of mankind."
Simmons was convicted of the 1993 murder of Shirley Crook.
Prosecutors say he planned the burglary and killing.
The victim, wearing only underwear and cowboy boots, was hog tied and thrown off a bridge.
Simmons was sentenced to die, but Missouri's highest court overturned the sentence last year.
Justice Antonin Scalia, a death penalty supporter, said the court could be asked to declare juveniles too immature to face punishment of any kind.
"Why pick on the death penalty?
Why not say they're immune from any criminal penalty?" he asked.
"I don't see where there's a logical line."
The case has drawn intense interest.
People carrying sleeping bags arrived at the Supreme Court before midnight in hopes of getting a seat for the argument.
It featured a lively debate that touched on gang violence, global influence on America and scientific evidence about the development of the teenage brain.
The Supreme Court increasingly has looked at international opinion.
The four most liberal members Ginsburg, Breyer, and Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter have taken a stand against the death penalty for minors, saying it is "a relic of the past and is inconsistent with evolving standards of decency in a civilized society."
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, also an important swing vote, spoke only once during the arguments.
She pointed out that the statistics about the use of executions for juveniles showed the same consensus as existed two years ago against executing the mentally retarded.
About 20 states allowed executions of retarded people when the court voted 6 3 to outlaw them.
Kennedy and O'Connor supported the 2002 decision.
The Supreme Court struggled Wednesday over whether the time has come to end the death penalty for young murderers.
Now that Iran and Congo say they have repudiated the practice, the United States stands alone in the world in sanctioning the execution of minors.
Two years ago, the court in a 6 3 decision abolished capital punishment for the mentally retarded, saying that a "national consensus" had emerged that executing such persons amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.
They noted that all but a handful of states had exempted mentally retarded persons from the death penalty.
On Wednesday, the justices debated whether a similar national consensus exists that now calls for limiting capital punishment to murderers who are age 18 or above when they commit crimes.
Despite the vote of two years ago, it was not clear from Wednesday's argument that a majority would exempt youthful killers.
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said he was worried that teenage criminals will be emboldened if they are free from the full force of the criminal law.
"Juveniles run in gangs," he said, reasoning that gang members would dodge the death penalty by recruiting their youngest members as "the hit man."
"I'm very concerned about that," said Kennedy, who voted in the majority to stop the death penalty for mentally retarded individuals.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the other swing vote, noted that several states in recent years have raised the minimum age to 18 for imposing the death penalty.
"It's about the same consensus that existed on mental retardation," she said, in a hopeful sign for the foes of capital punishment.
Currently, most states either have no death penalty law or set 18 as the minimum age.
Still, 19 states permit prosecutors to seek a death sentence for murderers who are 16 or 17, although fewer have done so of late.
In 1999, for example, 14 underage murderers received death sentences, but the number has declined steadily.
Only two teenage murderers received death sentences last year and only one such sentence has been handed down this year.
The clear leader remains Texas.
As of June 30, 72 people who were 16 or 17 at the time of their crimes sat on death rows around the nation, and 28 of them were in Texas.
The case before the court Wednesday came from Missouri.
It concerned Christopher Simmons, who in 1993 abducted a woman in his neighborhood, bound her in duct tape and threw her alive into a river from a railroad bridge.
He was 17 at the time of the murder and bragged to a friend that he would get off because of his age.
Instead, a jury outside St. Louis convicted him and sentenced him to die.
The Missouri Supreme Court voided the death sentence and ordered him to spend life in prison, and the state attorney general filed an appeal.
James Layton, a Missouri state attorney, urged the justices to let juries weigh each case and decide for themselves when a murderer deserves death.
If the age for capital punishment needs to be changed, it should be done by elected lawmakers, not judges, he said.
"Age is a legislative question.
It is the kind of fact a legislature should decide, not this court," he argued.
Seth Waxman, the former U.S. solicitor general in the Clinton administration, argued for Simmons and he urged the high court to set a constitutional rule that limits capital punishment to those who are legally adults.
In law, "18 is the bright line between childhood and adulthood," he said.
Since young people need to be age 18 to vote, to join the military, to gamble, or even to marry without their parents' consent, it is reasonable to set 18 as the minimum age for capital punishment, he said.
"We are literally alone in the world" in permitting the executions of those who committed crimes as juveniles, Waxman said.
The United Nations Commission on Human Rights said six nations besides the United States executed juvenile offenders during the 1990s.
They are Congo, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
But its report said all of these countries have repudiated the practice in the past five years.
A long list of other groups, including the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the European Union and Nobel Prize laureates led by former President Carter, filed briefs urging the court to halt the execution of young offenders.
Four justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer have said in the past they believe such executions are a "shameful practice" and should be abolished.
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas have said the court should leave the issue to the states.
The justices will meet behind closed doors later this week to vote on the case of Roper vs. Simmons.
A ruling is due in several months.
The Supreme Court opens its new term Monday faced with urgent business and looming uncertainty.
The justices' most pressing task is to resolve the fate of the federal criminal sentencing system, which the court itself threw into limbo in June by declaring unconstitutional a similar, although not identical, system used by the state of Washington.
In both the state and federal systems, sentencing guidelines provide a starting point for calculating a criminal sentence, and judges then make findings about a variety of factors to determine how much time a defendant will actually serve.
The Supreme Court ruled in Blakely v. Washington that the state system violated the constitutional right to trial by jury by permitting judges to make these essential findings.
Federal judges around the country quickly started ruling that they could no longer treat the federal sentencing guidelines as binding.
Whether that judgment is correct and, if so, what should happen next will be the subject of an unusual afternoon argument on Monday in two cases that the justices in August granted at the Justice Department's request and agreed to expedite for an argument.
While the sentencing cases alone United States v. Booker, No. 04 104, and United States v. Fanfan, No. 04 105 would mark this as an unusually important term for criminal law, the justices have also agreed to decide a significant death penalty case.
The question in Roper v. Simmons, No. 03 633, is whether executing someone convicted of committing a capital murder at the age of 16 or 17 offends "evolving standards of decency in a civilized society."
That is the test the court applies to decide whether a punishment is "cruel and unusual" within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.
In 1988, the court prohibited the execution of those whose crimes were committed at 15 or younger, but refused the next year to extend that decision to 16 and 17 year olds.
Although there have been few executions for juvenile crimes in recent years, the United States is one of only a handful of nations where such executions are still legal, and the case has attracted worldwide attention.
Seventy three people are currently on death row in 12 states one third of them in Texas for crimes committed before the age of 18.
The Supreme Court justices, a solemn and sober lot, will spend time this fall talking about wine, beef, marijuana and dogs, all part of their wide ranging duty to police the limits of the government's power.
They will also consider whether young murderers can be put to death for their crimes.
But when the court's term officially opens Monday, the first order of business will be to answer a question raised at the end of the last term: Is the federal sentencing system, which punishes 64000 criminals a year, unconstitutional because it allows judges, acting alone, to add to prison terms?
If so, the Supreme Court may force a profound shift in how criminals are sentenced in America, one that will affect the state courts in many states as well as the federal system.
Until now, the general understanding has been that prosecutors charge defendants with a crime, juries typically decide whether they are guilty and, if so, judges impose the punishment.
In recent rulings, however, a narrow Supreme Court majority has said the right to a jury trial also includes the right to have a jury decide the key facts that determine a sentence.
Other than a prior conviction, "any fact that increases the penalty for a crime" must be decided by the jury or admitted by the defendant, Justice Antonin Scalia said for a 5 4 majority in the case of Blakeley vs. Washington.
That simple statement struck down the sentencing system in Washington state, and it now threatens to do the same in the federal system.
In both, judges are authorized to decide the "aggravating factors" that increase a prison term.
Take, for example, the case of Ducan Fanfan, who last year sold a small bag of cocaine to an informer outside a Burger King restaurant near Portland, Maine.
A jury found him guilty as charged of selling at least 500 grams of cocaine, a crime that called for six years in prison under U.S. sentencing guidelines.
On June 28, four days after the Blakely ruling, Fanfan came before a federal judge for sentencing.
Prosecutors said the defendant was the leader of a drug gang who had 2.5 kilograms of cocaine in his home and car.
Based on these facts which the judge found to be true Fanfan should go to prison for 16 years.
However, imposing such a stiff sentence would be unconstitutional under the just announced Blakely ruling, the judge concluded.
So he sent Fanfan to prison for six years based on just the jury's verdict.
Bush administration lawyers appealed Fanfan's case directly to the Supreme Court.
They argued that it made a "mockery" of the law by permitting judges to give more lenient sentences based on certain facts but forbidding them from increasing the sentences based on other facts.
Fanfan's is one of two cases that will be heard Monday afternoon as the justices debate what to do with the federal sentencing system.
The outcome is likely to affect most state courts.
The future of the death penalty for young murderers also is in doubt.
Four liberal justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer have already said they view such as executions as "shameful" and a "relic of the past."
If they are joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor or Anthony M. Kennedy, the court would limit capital punishment to those who are age 18 or older at the time of their crime.
Since 1990, only Texas, Oklahoma and Virginia have carried out executions of young murderers.
The justices will take up a Missouri case, Roper vs. Simmons, on Oct 13 to decide the issue.
The wine and marijuana cases will come before the court in December.
As wine has grown in popularity, many wine drinkers have asked whether they can order their favorite vintage from a distant vineyard and have it shipped directly to them.
The answer depends on state laws.
About half the states forbid all direct shipments of wine across their borders.
Only licensed wholesalers are permitted to import alcohol, and they in turn sell it to retailers.
The states rely on the 21st Amendment, which repealed the prohibition on alcohol sales and was approved in 1933, for this authority.
The amendment states that "importation into any state ,of intoxicating liquors is hereby prohibited."
Although all states permit the sale of alcohol, they do so only through their own sets of regulations.
Eleanor Heald, a wine critic from Troy, Mich., and David Lucas, the owner of a small winery near Lodi, Calif., are challenging the bans on wine shipments to Michigan and New York.
In the case of Granholm vs. Heald, they argue that the Constitution calls for a free flow of commerce across state lines, including that of alcohol.
"This case will determine whether consumers or a cartel of billion dollar distributors will determine what wine is available to consumers in New York or two dozen other states," said Clint Bolick of the Washington based Institute for Justice, who represents Lucas.
The case of John Ashcroft vs. Angel Raich may determine the fate of the medical marijuana laws in nine states.
Raich, who suffers from a brain tumor, uses homegrown marijuana to relieve her pain.
This is legal under the Compassionate Use Act approved by California's voters.
However, Ashcroft, the U.S. attorney general, says federal drug laws forbid all use of marijuana.
Federal agents raided the homes of several Californian patients who grew their own.
In the last decade, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the conservative leader, has insisted on limiting federal power.
For example, he spoke for a 5 4 majority that struck down the federal Gun Free Schools Zone Act on the grounds that mere gun possession did not involve interstate commerce.
The liberal dissenters said the court should uphold the broad power of Congress.
Last year, the liberal 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned the tables.
Relying on the logic of Rehnquist's opinion, it ruled the use of homegrown marijuana was beyond the federal authority because it did not involve interstate commerce.
The court also will hear a challenge to a unique California prison policy that segregates new inmates by race for as many as 60 days.
Prison officials say they seek to prevent gang violence while new inmates are evaluated.
Lawyers for Garrison Johnson, a black inmate, say racial segregation is unconstitutional in all instances.The court also will decide whether police can use drug sniffing dogs in routine traffic stops.
Usually, officers need some evidence of a drug crime before they search for narcotics.
But prosecutors contend that when a trained dog sniffs the air, it is not engaged in a search, and therefore police may use dogs whenever and however they choose.
The agriculture industry will be closely watching a case about government sponsored ad campaigns.
Cattlemen are challenging the fees they must pay for ads such as "Beef, It's What for Dinner."
Dozens of similar ad campaigns are sponsored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as well as many states.
A ruling in the case of Veneman vs.
Livestock Marketing Association could free farmers from having to pay for them.
A possible revolution in the federal criminal justice system will be on the agenda when the Supreme Court opens its new term Monday.
In a rare two hour afternoon oral argument session, the justices will consider whether the federal sentencing guidelines a manual of 400 plus pages meant to ensure that federal courts give defendants across the country approximately equal punishments for similar crimes can be reconciled with the Constitution.
The court is hearing the case on an expedited schedule in response to the uproar and confusion created by a 5 to 4 ruling it issued June 24, just before leaving for summer recess.
In that case, Blakely vs. Washington, the court struck down Washington state's sentencing guidelines, which, like the federal guidelines, permit judges to boost sentences based on their own post conviction fact finding, rather than relying only on facts admitted by the defendant or found by a jury.
That, the court ruled, violates the right to a jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.
Though the court said in Blakely that it did not address the federal guidelines, the similarities between Washington's system and the federal system were such that defense lawyers across the country immediately began bombarding courts with Blakely challenges to their clients' sentences.
Lower courts have issued differing rulings in response, and some federal prosecutors have felt obliged to redraft indictments to make sure they conform to Blakely.
"It looks like a Number 10 earthquake to me," Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who dissented in Blakely, told a conference of federal judges in July.
Although determining the precise magnitude of the Blakely aftershocks is the court's first major item of business, Blakely is by no means the only case of potential national significance on the court's docket.
On Oct 13, the court will hear arguments in Roper vs. Simmons, No. 03 633, a challenge to the constitutionality of the death penalty for persons who commit crimes while younger than 18.
The court has barred capital punishment for those younger than 16, but it ruled in 1989 that capital punishment for 16 and 17 year old defendants does not constitute "cruel and unusual punishment."
However, the court may decide that a "national consensus" has now formed against imposing the ultimate penalty against minors just as it did in 2002 with respect to the death penalty for moderately mentally retarded offenders.
It is nearly certain that the court's two swing voters, Justices O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy, will determine the outcome.
Four members of the court John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer have already declared in a published opinion that they believe the death penalty for juveniles should be abolished.
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas opposed the 2002 mental retardation ruling, which opponents of capital punishment for juveniles are relying on to make their case.
(Optional Add End) If the court throws out the sentencing guidelines, the issue will return to Congress.
Early congressional reactions to Blakely suggest that the ultimate result of scrapping the guidelines would be harsher penalties prescribed by politicians reluctant to be seen as soft on crime.
"(I)t may take only a couple of lenient sentences in high profile cases to raise enough of a stir to increase mandatory minimum penalties," Sen Orrin G. Hatch (R Utah) said at a July 13 hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Eleven years later, the chilling imagery of her sister's murder still makes Pertie Mitchell shiver.
During a burglary, two teens stretched duct tape across Shirley Crook's mouth and eyes, then muscled her into her van.
An hour later, the hogtied woman was dumped off into the murky Meramec River.
"Bubble, bubble," witnesses later said they heard Christopher Simmons snicker as the woman's body sank.
"It makes your hands sweat, your stomach sick," Mitchell said, hoping for the day that Simmons is put to death.
"I will be there.
I will watch him die."
The execution is not certain, though.
Using the Simmons case, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday on whether it is constitutional to execute killers who were juveniles when the crimes were committed.
The court agreed to hear the case after the Missouri Supreme Court last year struck down executions of juveniles and re sentenced Simmons, now 28, to life in prison, deciding that such executions violate "evolving standards of decency."
Nineteen states allow executions of killers who were 16 or 17 at the time of the crime.
Since the 1976 reinstatement of the death penalty, 22 people 13 of them in Texas have been executed for crimes committed as 16 or 17 year olds.
The U.S. Supreme Court in 1988 barred the death penalty for those 15 and younger.
Simmons and his attorneys did not reply to interview requests.
His advocates have said that executing people who kill as juveniles would be just as wrong as putting to death the mentally challenged, a practice outlawed by the Supreme Court in 2002.
People less than 18 years old, they argue, don't have fully developed brains and are incapable of making rational decisions.
Mitchell believes Simmons, who was then 17, was old enough to know right from wrong.
"You know how many people get married or join the service when they're 17 or 18 years old?" said Mitchell, 66.
"This man has nothing to justify what he did."
Simmons' advocates argue that he led a tough life, from the time his parents separated.
Abuse by a relative, they said, included tying him as a toddler to a tree for hours to keep him from wandering while the man fished or taking him to a bar and plying him with alcohol for the amusement of patrons.
By 13, Simmons was smoking marijuana and swilling hard liquor.
He dabbled with mushrooms, cocaine and LSD, and broke into cars and homes.
About 2 a.m. on Sept 9, 1993, Simmons and Charles Benjamin, then 15, found an open window at the home of Crook, a neighbor near St. Louis.
Crook was sleeping alone inside, her husband Steven like her, a trucker was away on the road.
Simmons bound her and forced her wearing only underwear and cowboy boots into her van.
They drove 26 kilometers (16 miles) to Castlewood State Park, led her to the middle of the trestle above the Meramec and tossed her into the water.
Two fishermen found the body 12 hours later.
Authorities said Simmons privately boasted of killing Crook because she had seen his face.
He was arrested the next day.
"I have a picture in my mind that she can't see, she can't speak, she can't scream out," Crook's daughter, Kimberly Hawkins, said at Simmons' trial.
"I can imagine the terror that she's thinking."
Prosecutors called the crimes anything but impulsive.
They said Simmons believed he could escape punishment because he was a juvenile.
Simmons later claimed that any scheming was "just stupid talk," and he denied ever believing he could get away with it because he was a minor.
He was sentenced to death in 1994.
Benjamin, tried separately as an adult but not eligible for the death sentence, given his age, was convicted and sentenced to life without parole.
In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Benjamin, now 26, said he hopes Simmons prevails, thinking adolescence mitigates culpability.
"I believe age should factor in some way not the death penalty," Benjamin said from prison.
Crook's death, he said, is "not something that can be easily blocked out."
These days, Mitchell talks of little successes, like paring to just one the number of antidepressants she still takes to deal with the crime that "never leaves you."
"Can you imagine what Shirley must have been feeling, fighting for a breath of air and what her mind must have been saying to her?
I think of that all the time," she said.
"You'd think I'd cried enough, but it never ends."
The US Supreme Court on Wednesday heard arguments on the legality of the death penalty for criminals aged under 18 in a case that has received international attention.
The outcome appeared in the balance with the nine member court divided and the result likely to be decided by the two moderate justices.
The Supreme Court has been asked to rule on the fate of Christopher Simmons, who was condemned to death for the 1993 murder in Missouri of a woman who was abducted, tied up and thrown to her death from a bridge.
He was 17 at the time.
The Missouri Supreme Court commuted Simmons' sentence to life in prison in 2003, and the state has appealed that decision.
The US Supreme Court abolished the death sentence for those aged under 16 in 1988.
But the United States remains one of five countries that allow the execution of those aged 16 18 and there has been growing domestic and international pressure to halt that as well.
Only a few states still order executions for juveniles.
They include Texas and Alabama.
The Simmons case would decide the fate of 73 people currently on death row across the United States for crimes committed when they were minors.
The three most conservative members of the court seemed to lean toward allowing the practice to continue.
Opinions given for previous cases indicate that the court's four more progressive justices favor abolishing juvenile execution.
Justice Anthony Kennedy, who along with Sandra Day O'Connor are considered the moderates, asked whether world opinion should be taken into account.
"No," answered James Layton, representing Missouri state which wants Simmons executed.
"Isn't it relevant?"
Justice Stephen Breyer asked, adding that he was not implying that it was up to the world to impose law on the United States.
Kennedy said, "What we do here should influence the rest of the world."
O'Connor, who joined Kennedy in passing a 2002 decision barring the execution of mentally ill people, appeared to agree.
Quoting President Thomas Jefferson, one of the framers of the US Constitution, she said, "To lead the world you must show a decent respect of mankind."
The Missouri attorney argued that "there are 17 year olds that are equally culpable as 18 year olds."
But Justice Ruth Ginsburg interrupted him to highlight that in the United States people under 18 years old cannot "buy tobacco, vote, sit on a jury."
"Why would someone be death eligible but not eligible to be an adult member of the community?" she asked.
O'Connor compared society's evolution toward opposing the juvenile death penalty to its position on executing the mentally ill.
"There was an inexorable trend concerning mental retardation, not here," Layton said, adding that if the number of executions of minors has decreased in the last few years it could rise in the future.
In the last 10 years, only three states Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia have executed persons who were under 18.
Only two teenagers were condemned to death in 2003, compared with 15 in 1999.
Kennedy said he was concerned that eliminating the death penalty for young criminals would remove a "deterrent", notably among gang members.
But Simmons' attorney, Seth Waxman, replied that the death penalty was a useless deterrent against minors since "they weigh risks differently" to adults.
A plea to declare capital punishment for juvenile offenders unconstitutional received a skeptical hearing at the Supreme Court Wednesday, as one of two justices likely to be pivotal to the outcome voiced repeated doubts.
Justice Anthony Kennedy observed that he was "troubled" that a ban might lead gang leaders to use 16 or 17 year olds as "hit men."
"I'm very concerned about that," Kennedy told Seth Waxman, a former solicitor general of the United States who was arguing on behalf of Missouri death row inmate Christopher Simmons, who faces execution for a murder he committed at 17.
"I'm talking about the deterrent value of the existing rule."
Waxman replied that deterrence does not work with juvenile offenders because they "are impulsive and subject to peer pressure."
But Kennedy responded that many 17 year old offenders were "ringleaders" in brutal, calculated murders, according to a friend of the court brief filed by a group of states that wish to retain a death penalty for juveniles.
Kennedy said the brief was "chilling reading."
Kennedy's vote is crucial because four justices, John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, have already declared their belief that executing those who commit crimes while under the age of 18 is "cruel and unusual punishment."
The records of Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas suggest that they think the issue should be left up to the states.
That leaves only Kennedy and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as possible fifth votes for a ban.
O'Connor was mostly silent in Wednesday's hearing.
The Supreme Court upheld capital punishment for 16 and 17 year old offenders in 1989.
It banned it for those 15 and under in 1988.
Until now, the court's position has been unaffected by its 2002 decision to ban the death penalty for the moderately mentally retarded.
In that case, Kennedy and O'Connor joined Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
The court found that a national consensus against the practice had formed since 1989.
The best evidence for that, the court ruled, was that the number of states banning the death penalty for the retarded had grown from two to 13.
Many death penalty opponents immediately recognized that a similar argument could be applied to juveniles.
Yet in the 2002 opinion, written by Stevens, the court seemed to warn that it was not ready for that, contrasting the strong trend against executing the retarded with the fact that, between 1989 and 2002, only two states had raised their death penalty ages to 18.
Three times in the last two years, the court refused to hear appeals from death row inmates who had killed while juveniles despite a strongly worded dissent in one case from Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
Last year, the court actually reinstated the death penalty of a juvenile offender in Oklahoma after a federal appeals court had blocked it.
The vote was 5 to 4, with both Kennedy and O'Connor in the majority.
The court intervened in the Simmons case only after the Missouri Supreme Court threw out Simmons' sentence last year on the grounds that the 1989 precedent had, indeed, been superseded by the 2002 case.
Waxman pressed a similar argument Wednesday.
He told the court that the execution of juvenile criminals conflicts with a "robust consensus" reflected in the recent decisions of several states to ban the practice and in the decreasing frequency with which juries actually impose the death penalty on those under 18.
Scientific evidence shows that areas of the brain in charge of judgment and impulse control are incomplete in adolescents, he said.
Death is the wrong punishment for crimes that reflect "the transient psychosocial characteristics that rage in adolescents," Waxman said.
But Kennedy noted that the American Psychological Association which told the court in a brief in this case that adolescents were too immature to qualify for capital punishment had also said in a case about parental notification for abortion that teen agers were old enough to make such a decision on their own.
"They flip flopped," Kennedy said.
Waxman said there was no inconsistency, because "what was at issue in that case was the competency to decide," while the question in this case is "factors why adolescents are less morally culpable."
He also urged the court to act based on a "worldwide consensus" against the death penalty for juveniles, noting that except for the United States, all 110 countries that retain capital punishment do not apply it to those under 18.
States that permit it "are not just alone in this country, they are alone in the world," he said.
On this point, Kennedy appeared to sympathize with Waxman, asking Missouri state solicitor James Layton, "There seems to be a very substantial demonstration that world opinion is against us,Does that have a bearing on what's 'unusual" punishment?
Layton replied that "what matters" is American legislation.
O'Connor's only remark also hinted at some openness to Waxman's position.
Addressing Layton, she noted that the number of states that either do not have capital punishment or set the age at 18 is "about the same" as the number of those that banned executing the retarded in 2002, which was 30.
"There is no inexorable trend here," Layton replied.
The case is Roper vs. Simmons.
A decision is expected by July.
For release Sunday, Oct 3 WASHINGTON The death penalty, drugs and civil rights are before the Supreme Court in its new term, which begins Monday with relatively little public notice amid the presidential campaign's final month.
While President Bush and Sen John Kerry, D Mass., pound away at each other on the stump, the nine justices will start their session at 10 a.m. with the court's marshal saying, "God save the United States and this honorable court."
But the calm of the courtroom is probably what the deliberative justices would prefer this fall, just four years after a presidential election in which they attracted global attention and essentially cast the deciding vote.
"They (the justices) are probably perfectly happy that people are concerned about other things," said attorney Theodore Olson, who argued Bush's case in the 5 4 decision in Bush v. Gore that ended the Florida recount, sealing Bush's victory.
The justices, however, would not shy away if this year's election also arrived at their doorstep, added Olson, who served from 2001 until July as U.S. solicitor general, President Bush's top lawyer before the high court.
The justices this year have already shown that they are not afraid to revisit earlier rulings.
In taking the case of a man convicted of murder when he was 17, the court will reconsider its 1989 decision in Stanford v. Kentucky that the Constitution permits the execution of 16 year old killers.
To raise that minimum age, the court would need to decide that a national consensus has emerged since that year that it is cruel and unusual to execute murderers who had not reached adulthood when they committed their crime.
Attorneys for the man, Christopher Simmons, are urging the Supreme Court to do for youngsters on death row what it did two years ago for condemned killers who have mental retardation.
In 2002, it overturned a 1989 ruling that had permitted executing the mentally retarded, saying that a national consensus had emerged that executing such people violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.
It based its decision largely on the growing number of death penalty states to have outlawed such executions: up from two in 1989 to 16 in 2002.
But Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon says the court should hold fast to its decision allowing the execution of minors.
Some killings are so heinous as to warrant not only charging minors as adults as is often the case today but to hold them to the ultimate penalty as well, he argues.
Simmons was convicted and sentenced to death in 1993, when he was 17, for forcing Shirley Crook from her bed, tying her hands and legs together with electric cable, covering her face with duct tape and pushing her from a railroad trestle into a river below, where she drowned.
The Missouri Supreme Court last year upheld the conviction but threw out the death sentence, saying that to execute someone for crimes committed before reaching age 18 would be cruel and unusual in light of current societal standards.
The justices will hear arguments in the Missouri case, Roper v. Simmons, on Oct 13 and render their decision by the summer.
(Optional add begins) Nixon, pressing Missouri's appeal to the justices, assails that ruling as violating the U.S. Supreme Court's still valid decision from 1989 that executing 17 year olds is permissible.
Though the Missouri court might feel times have changed, it must continue to rely on the justices' determination, he writes in the state's appeal.
The attorney general also disputes that a national consensus has emerged against executing childhood offenders, saying it has become increasingly common during the past decade for violent young offenders to be tried and sentenced as adults.
Countering the state, Simmons' lawyers argue that the Missouri court merely followed the justices' test for determining whether decency standards have evolved sufficiently to warrant a change in applying the death penalty.
Death penalty states during the past decade have moved to abolish the punishment as applied to minors, and the number of killers under age 18 sentenced to death has dropped from 14 in 1999 to two last year, the lawyers said, citing data from statistician Victor Streib.
(Optional add ends) In a case on marijuana, the justices will consider whether Congress overstepped its authority by outlawing marijuana use for medicinal purposes when the plant is grown in the same state where it is prescribed.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the federal Controlled Substances Act cannot be enforced against two California residents who were prescribed marijuana to treat debilitating medical conditions.
The San Francisco based court said Congress' constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce cannot be invoked to outlaw the medicinal use of marijuana grown, prescribed and used in the same state.
Appealing that decision to the justices, the government says Congress can outlaw the intrastate use of dangerous drugs even if state law allows doctors to prescribe them.
It argues the use of illegal drugs cannot be confined to one state, but rather inevitably spills over into interstate trade, which Congress can regulate.
"Local manufacturing, possession and use of controlled substances increase the demand for such drugs, which in turn leads to increased supply and marketing to users," the government states in papers filed with the high court.
The California residents counter that using marijuana on a limited, as medically necessary basis has no significant impact on the interstate drug trade.
In addition, Congress tramples on states' rights when it seeks to regulate the use of a drug that state law says may be prescribed for certain medical conditions, Angel Raich and Diane Monson state in papers filed with the justices.
Raich suffers from a variety of chronically painful medical conditions, including scoliosis, joint dysfunction, headaches, multiple chemical sensitivities, asthma and seizures.
Monson suffers from a degenerative spinal disease that causes chronic back pain and painful muscle spasms.
They each have been prescribed marijuana to relieve the pain, which is permitted under California's 1996 Compassionate Use Act. Eight other states have enacted similar "medical marijuana" laws, including Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.
The case is Ashcroft v. Raich.
In a coaching case testing civil rights, Roderick Jackson claims the Birmingham, Ala., Board of Education fired him in 2001 as a high school girls basketball coach after he protested to supervisors that his team was not receiving the same funding and access to athletic facilities as the boys' squad.
Jackson sued the board, claiming that his retaliatory firing violated Title IX of the federal 1972 Education Amendments, which requires equal treatment of boys and girls teams in scholastic sports.
The U.S. District Court for Northern Alabama dismissed Jackson's lawsuit, saying Title IX has no provision allowing people to sue for retaliatory actions by school officials.
The Atlanta based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed.
In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Jackson argues that the right to sue for retaliation is implicit in any anti discrimination law.
Accordingly, the U.S. Education Department has adopted regulations that protect teachers who complain about illegal bias, Jackson states in papers filed with the justices.
"If schools and other defendants could freely retaliate against those who protest discriminatory treatment, they would effectively be engaging in the discrimination prohibited by the statute," Jackson wrote.
The U.S. government supports Jackson's position in a legal brief filed with the court.
"Just as Title IX's broad prohibition against intentional discrimination covers other forms of intentional discrimination to which the statute does not specifically refer (e.g. sexual harassment), it covers intentionally discriminatory retaliation," the government states.
"Teachers and coaches are often in a much better position to identify sex discrimination and express opposition to it than are the students who are denied equal educational opportunities."
The school board counters that courts should not read into Title IX a right to sue that is not explicitly stated in the statute.
The case is Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education.
The court is expected to render by the summer its decisions in the approximately 80 cases it will hear between October and April.
The coming term marks the 11th consecutive one with the same nine justices, further extending this panel's modern record for Supreme Court stability.
Three months ago, the Supreme Court issued an opinion that seemed to outlaw the way much of the nation sentences criminals.
Then they went on vacation, leaving judges, prosecutors, and thousands of defendants confused about what to do.
As the justices return to work Monday, their first task is to belatedly explain the new rules.
The new term is dominated by criminal justice matters, with cases involving the death penalty for juveniles, medical marijuana, drug sniffing police dogs during routine traffic stops, and the continued detention of Cubans brought over during the Mariel boat lift who finished their prison sentences but cannot be returned to Cuba because Fidel Castro will not take them back.
But before the court can take on the new issues, it will revisit its 5 to 4 decision last term in Blakeley v. Washington.
In that case, it struck down guidelines under which judges add time to the normal range for a sentence based on aggravating facts not found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury for example, increasing the penalty for a kidnapping conviction if the offense involved cruel mistreatment of a victim.
The majority said such a system violates the Constitution's guarantee of a jury trial.
Because as many as 21 states and the federal government use a similar arrangement, the ruling cast much of the criminal justice system into doubt and had an immediate impact on thousands of open cases.
But the justices neglected to explain the implications of their decision, and lower courts have come up with wildly different interpretations of what it meant.
"They went off for three months on vacation, leaving a lot of people scrambling to figure out how to make the system work," said Julie O'Sullivan, a law professor at Georgetown University.
"That struck me as an irresponsible and arrogant thing to do.
They have to decide just how much remains of the federal sentencing system."
Seeking an opinion that will clear up the confusion, the federal government asked for expedited review of the cases of Duncan Fanfan and Freddie J. Booker, both convicts challenging their guideline set sentences.
At risk is the whole system of judges examining the facts after a basic jury verdict to come up with sentences that distinguish between bad and worse instances of a crime.
If the court strikes down guidelines, many current defendants could receive only a minimum sentence.
But that defense victory could prove Pyrrhic: Analysts say legislatures could respond by imposing harsher mandatory sentences.
The arguments Monday will kick off a near record 10th term for the court without a lineup change.
Few expect the aging panel to remain intact another four years, so the upcoming presidential election's most long lasting impact may be in deciding who gets to nominate multiple replacements, thus transforming its current balance into a controlling ideological majority.
In the meantime, the justices have filled half the term's calendar and continue to review other appeals, one closely watched potential case is a challenge to Florida's ban on gay adoptions.
Rulings will be issued by the end of the term in June.
No terrorism case is on the calendar following the court's historic decision in that arena last term, when it sharply curtailed President Bush's claimed wartime power to indefinitely imprison suspected terrorists beyond the reach of judicial review.
But there are several cases dealing with the detention and deportation of noncitizens.
In Clark v. Martinez and Benitez v. Bozos, for example, the court will decide whether the government can continue to indefinitely imprison Cuban criminals from the 1980 Mariel boat lift who were never granted legal entry into the United States, but were "paroled" into the country.
Having committed crimes and served out their sentences, they face deportation.
But Cuba refuses to accept them, so they and about 900 others are locked up in limbo.
In 2001, the court ruled that detaining legal immigrants for more than six months was unconstitutional.
This case will decide whether people who have not legally entered the country have the same rights.
One case of local interest is Smith v. Massachusetts, which comes from a 1996 shooting in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood.
The court must decide whether defendant Melvin Smith's "double jeopardy" protection against successive prosecution was violated when a judge first granted a defense motion to declare him not guilty of a charge, then withdrew that verdict and allowed the charge to go to a jury.
A Connecticut case, Kelo v. New London, will determine whether a government can use eminent domain to clear space for private redevelopment.
The Fifth Amendment limits the power to force unwilling owners to sell in cases where the property will be put to "public use," usually for something like a road.
Here, a neighborhood would be razed for the "public purpose" of generating greater tax revenue.
Roper v. Simmons presents the court with an opportunity to strike down the death penalty for crimes committed by a juvenile.
The case arrives two years after its decision to strike down the death penalty for mentally retarded criminals.
The court had upheld both policies in 1989.
In reversing course for criminals with diminished mental abilities, it reasoned that society's evolving standard of decency had reached a consensus that such criminals were less culpable than people of normal intelligence and so executing them is considered "cruel and unusual punishment" prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.
Challengers to the juvenile death penalty similarly argue that the number of death sentences for offenses committed by minors has dwindled and there is a growing reluctance to carry out such executions.
Because nearly the entire world has outlawed the juvenile death penalty, court watchers are interested in whether justices will cite foreign practices, as some did when striking down sodomy laws two years ago.
The emerging trend of looking abroad for comparative input has drawn fire from conservatives, who say only domestic law should be relevant.
In Illinois v. Caballes, the court will decide whether police may search a car with a drug sniffing dog during a routine traffic stop without an individualized reason to be suspicious.
The case hinges on what expectation of privacy people driving in their car have.
In Ashcroft v. Reich, the court will consider whether federal agents lack authority to interfere with medical marijuana grown by seriously ill people who do not take it across state lines.
California voters legalized medicinal marijuana in state law eight years ago, but it remains illegal under federal law.
The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a generally liberal court based in San Francisco, ruled that home grown and home consumed marijuana is not related to interstate commerce, and so the Constitution does not give Congress the authority to regulate it.
That invokes the same reasoning that conservative majorities on the Supreme Court have used to strike down federal laws against guns in schools and violence against women.
But the Supreme Court frequently reverses the Ninth Circuit and has consistently rejected challenges to federal drug laws.
"This represents another case in an ongoing battle between the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit is playing games," said Michael Gottesman, a law professor at Georgetown.
"If you play games and the other side is the Supreme Court, you're not going to win."
When the U.S. Supreme Court decides to overturn the laws of 20 states, the American people have every reason to expect that the judicial decision has firm grounding in the Constitution.
Citizens might also hope that if the justices decide to overrule the duly elected representatives of the people, the lawmaking process in the states and its own precedent, that the constitutional issues would be so crystalline as to elicit a unanimous or near unanimous decision.
In its recent ruling in Roper v. Simmons, five Supreme Court justices have failed miserably to meet either of the above standards.
In determining that 16 and 17 year old murderers cannot, under any circumstances, face the death penalty, Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, David Souter and John Paul Stevens have established a dangerous precedent for judicial activism.
As a resident of Texas, which leads the nation in executions, I believe we put too many people to death.
To paraphrase a famous quote about another deeply divisive moral issue, the death penalty should be lethal, legal and rare, sought by prosecutors in only the most extreme cases.
It naturally follows that the death penalty for minors should be even more rare.
Under what circumstances and when murderers in Texas face the death penalty is, however, a matter for Texas lawmakers and courts to decide.
The Supreme Court has arrogated this power to itself, creating for Texas juries the legal fallacy that they may only sentence to life imprisonment effectively, 40 years someone who was 17 years, 364 days old at the time of a horrendous capital crime, while an accomplice only a few days older can face the executioner's needle.
The court had already addressed this fallacy in its 1989 Stanford v. Kentucky decision, upholding the exceptional application of the death penalty for capital crimes committed at age 16 and 17.
What compelled the five justices to reverse that decision in 2005?
Kennedy's majority opinion cites the necessity of referring to "the evolving standards of decency" that lead to an emerging "national consensus" against the death penalty for minors.
Let's consider Kennedy's statistical case.
Count the 12 states that lack capital punishment in any form along with the 18 states that prohibit the death penalty for minor murderers and you have a resounding consensus a synonym for unanimity of exactly three fifths.
Here the justices wander into a judicial morass on other issues in which states show a greater semblance of national consensus.
Take, for example, gay marriage, which one state has legalized, while 38 states have passed laws that restrict marriage to the union of one man and one woman.
Should or would the Supreme Court freeze the current consensus in time and render unconstitutional the efforts of gays and lesbians to seek marital rights in their respective states?
And what of the true consensus in 1973 of all 50 states to restrict abortions to lesser or greater degrees?
Set aside for a moment the merits of a ruling based on the arbitrary interpretation of national consensus.
The most disturbing aspect of the court's decision is its reliance on 'the overwhelming weight of international opinion."
That is to say, five justices feel their power to interpret world sentiment and fabricate a national consensus supersedes the right of juries to deliver verdicts and assess penalties in accordance with the laws of their states.
Where in all this, one may reasonably ask, is our nation's Constitution?
What activist justices on the Supreme Court are effectively telling the American people is, 'Heads we win, tails you lose."
If the legislative process advances an agenda the justices support ideologically, they'll speed it along with a judicial decree based on rights not found in the Constitution.
If the same process advances an agenda the justices oppose, they'll quash it on the basis of an imaginary national consensus of five men and women and their reading of international public opinion, irrespective of the Constitution.

In banning capital punishment for juvenile offenders last week, the Supreme Court once again demonstrated its pivotal role in domestic and, indeed, world affairs.
The 5 to 4 ruling swept aside laws in 20 states that permitted juries to sentence 16 or 17 year old murderers to death, thus ending the United States' status as the last country on Earth that sanctioned the execution of those who commit crimes when they are younger than 18.
And, to a large extent, this result was due to a remarkable evolution by a single justice: Anthony Kennedy.
It is sometimes said that justices "grow in office," producing opinions and casting votes that confound the expectations of those who appointed them.
Kennedy, 68, a 1988 appointee of President Ronald Reagan, has previously shown his unpredictability.
He changed his mind in the middle of a crucial 1992 case, casting a fifth vote to uphold Roe v. Wade,@ he disappointed conservatives again with a landmark pro gay rights opinion in 2003.
Liberals gnashed their teeth when Kennedy flirted with permitting the Florida recount to continue in 2000 before casting a fifth vote to shut it down and propel George W. Bush into the White House.
But it isn't often that a justice reconsiders his past views on a major issue as thoroughly as Kennedy did last week, when he supplied the court's four justice liberal bloc the fifth vote it needed to abolish the death penalty for juveniles.
In 1989, during his first full term, Kennedy voted with a five justice majority to uphold the death penalty for juvenile offenders.
In that case, Stanford v. Kentucky,@ he joined an opinion by fellow Reagan appointee Antonin Scalia.
Reaching the opposite result in last week's case, Roper v. Simmons,@ Kennedy, writing for the majority, argued that times have changed.
The number of states that either have no capital punishment or do not allow it for offenders under 18 had reached 30 evidence, Kennedy wrote, of "a national consensus" against the juvenile death penalty that had emerged since Stanford.
But his opinion also repudiated the legal reasoning he embraced in Scalia's opinion 16 years ago.
For example, the 1989 opinion calculated "national consensus" differently, excluding non death penalty states from the count, last week, Kennedy wrote that Stanford was wrong about that.
In 1989, Scalia, with Kennedy's support, wrote there was "no relevance" to laws that set 18 or more as the legal age for adult activities such as drinking and voting and that it was "absurd" to consider them.
Last week, Kennedy appended to his opinion a list of state laws setting the age for voting, jury service or marriage without parental consent at 18 or above.
"The age of 18 is the point where society draws the line for many purposes between childhood and adulthood," Kennedy wrote.
"It is, we conclude, the age at which the line for death eligibility ought to rest."
In 1989, Kennedy agreed with Scalia in brushing aside scientific studies on the relative immaturity of adolescents.
Such data could not prove capital punishment fails to deter all 16 and 17 year olds, or that juveniles are inherently less morally blameworthy than adults, judgments about deterrence and blameworthiness should be left up to legislatures and juries, the Scalia Kennedy opinion said.
Last week, though, Kennedy cited "scientific and sociological studies" for the proposition that "it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult."
The weighing of such factors could not be left up to juries, Kennedy wrote, because there is "an unacceptable likelihood" that jurors would be "overpower(ed)" by the brutal details of some teen age crimes.
Kennedy had joined Scalia in 1989 in "emphatically rejecting" the suggestion that the court could apply its "own informed judgment" to the question of whether death is too harsh a punishment for any juvenile crime.
Last week, he wrote that that part of Stanford had been "inconsistent with prior ,decisions."
And, although he had joined Scalia in 1989 in "rejecting the contention ,that the sentencing practices of other countries are relevant," this time Kennedy wrote that "it is proper that we acknowledge the overwhelming weight of international opinion against the juvenile death penalty."
Not surprisingly, Scalia's dissent in Roper@ last week took aim at Kennedy, though not by name.
"The votes in today's case demonstrate that the offending of selected lawyers' moral sentiments is not a predictable basis for law much less a democratic one," he noted.
Invoking the motto that adorns the court's main entrance, Scalia, 68, added, "What kind of Equal Justice under Law is it that without so much as a 'Sorry about that' gives as the basis for sparing one person from execution arguments explicitly rejected in refusing to spare another?"
But Justice John Paul Stevens, the only member of the court's current liberal bloc who was on the bench in 1989, and who has now lived to see his dissent in Stanford@ become the law of the land, fired back in defense of Kennedy.
Stevens, 84, wrote that if Scalia's view of the Bill of Rights that its meaning was fixed by the common law standards of 1791 were to prevail, there would be nothing unconstitutional about the execution of a 7 year old child.
"(T)hat our understanding of the Constitution does change from time to time has been settled since John Marshall breathed life into its text," Stevens wrote.
The Supreme Court, in a decision indicating that its re examination of the role of judges in criminal sentencing is far from over, on Monday overturned a 15 year mandatory sentence that a federal appeals court had ordered imposed on a "career criminal."
The justices said the appeals court had mistakenly ordered the trial court to conduct too wide ranging an investigation into whether the defendant's previous convictions met the definition of prior offenses that would bring about the mandatory minimum sentence under a federal law, the Armed Career Criminal Act.
The trial judge's role should be considerably more limited, the court said in a 5 to 3 opinion by Justice David H. Souter.
The ruling strongly suggested that the sentencing debate, which earlier this year produced a decision that effectively amended the federal sentencing guidelines on the ground that they gave judges too much authority, will now take aim at a different target: prior offenses.
In 2000, when the court ruled in Apprendi v. New Jersey that the Constitution barred judges from making factual findings that led to increased sentences, the justices carved out one exception: findings that related to prior offenses.
Federal statutes and those in many states impose greater, often mandatory, sentences based on a defendant's prior record, so an interpretation of that record can often be the most important part of the sentencing process.
Ever since the Apprendi decision, there has been growing tension between the rule the court announced and the one exception it maintained.
The question in the case ruled Monday was whether four burglaries to which Reginald Shepard had earlier pleaded guilty qualified as the kind of prior offenses that made him eligible for the 15 year mandatory minimum sentence imposed on felons who are convicted of possession of firearms.
Under the federal law, a burglary of a house or other structure counted toward the minimum, while a burglary of a car or boat did not.
Shepard had pleaded guilty to the burglaries, but the plea agreement did not contain the necessary details about the crimes.
Consequently, the U.S. District Court in Boston refused the government's request for the 15 year mandatory minimum on the ground that the prosecution had not demonstrated that the burglaries were the relevant kind.
Shepard received a three year sentence instead.
On the government's appeal, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, also in Boston, instructed the district court to look for further evidence about the burglaries, including examining the original police reports that formed the basis for the prosecutor's complaint.
In a subsequent decision, it ordered the district court to impose the mandatory minimum sentence.
In his opinion overturning the appeals court's decision, Souter said the Supreme Court's most relevant precedent, as well as more recent developments a reference to the Apprendi decision meant that the trial judge's inquiry should be limited to official court records.
In cases involving plea bargains, he said, that meant the judge could look at the transcript of the plea agreement or related findings of fact, but could not go beyond the court files to look at police reports.
In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas said the time had come to take up a direct challenge to the Apprendi exception.
"Innumerable criminal defendants have been unconstitutionally sentenced under the flawed rule" that the court has maintained, he said.
In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the decision, Shepard v. United States, No. 03 9168, made "little sense" and would "substantially frustrate Congress' scheme for punishing repeat violent offenders who violate federal gun laws."
O'Connor said that it was a "commonsense inference" that Shepard's admitted burglaries had occurred in buildings and that there was no reason to presume that the state courts that accepted his guilty pleas had violated their duty to inform themselves that his pleas had a factual basis.
O'Connor, whose opinion was joined by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and Justice Stephen G. Breyer, noted that she had been a dissenter from the Apprendi decision and subsequent rulings that expanded on it.
"It is a battle I have lost," she said.
She said the court was now moving "into new territory that Apprendi and succeeding cases had expressly and consistently disclaimed."
O'Connor added, "Today's decision reads Apprendi to cast a shadow possibly implicating recidivism determinations, which until now had been safe from such formalism."
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist did not take part in this case.
There were these other developments at the court on Monday: JUVENILE DEATH PENALTY The court set aside death sentences for six men on death row in four states for crimes they committed before the age of 18.
The actions, certain to be followed by others, were necessitated by the court's ruling last week in Roper v. Simmons that the execution of those who committed crimes as juveniles violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments.
Three of the six were from Texas, while the others were from Virginia, Alabama and Mississippi.
PRISONERS' SUITS The court ruled by a vote of 8 1 that state prisoners challenging parole procedures or other procedural aspects of prison life can use a Reconstruction era civil rights statute to get into federal court rather than the considerably more restrictive habeas corpus statute.
Breyer wrote the opinion in Wilkinson v. Dotson, No. 03 287, and Kennedy was the lone dissenter.
The distinction the court drew Monday, while technical, has considerable practical importance for prisoners.
The decision affirmed a ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Cincinnati, which Ohio prison officials had appealed to the Supreme Court.
In order to file a habeas corpus petition, which challenges the constitutionality of a conviction or sentence, a prisoner must first exhaust any procedures the state might offer.
But there is no such requirement for going directly to federal court under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, better known as Section 1983.
Breyer said that prisoners bringing a challenge that, if successful, would simply get them a hearing or other procedural remedy should not be forced to use habeas corpus because they were not seeking the relief that habeas corpus provides, namely their freedom.
Executing murderers who were under 18 years old at the time of their crime is unconstitutional, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday, limiting the scope of capital punishment nationwide for the second time in three years.
In a 5 4 decision, the justices said a growing consensus among the states, and a recognition that minors are not yet fully formed intellectually or morally, led to the conclusion that executing anyone under 18 violates the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.
The ruling follows the same path as the court's 2002 decision that banned executions of the mentally retarded.
It comes less than 16 years after the justices issued two rulings on the same day that upheld the death penalty for 16 and 17 year olds and the retarded.
"The reality that juveniles still struggle to define their identity means it is less supportable to conclude that even a heinous crime committed by a juvenile is evidence of irretrievably depraved character," said Justice Anthony Kennedy in Tuesday's majority opinion.
Compared to adults, he said, "a greater possibility exists that a minor's character deficiencies will be reformed."
He noted that American society sets the boundary between childhood and adulthood at 18 in deciding who can vote, serve on a jury or marry without parental consent.
That is also an appropriate dividing line for those who are subject to the law's supreme punishment, Kennedy said.
Kennedy also said the United States, until Tuesday, was the only remaining nation to give official endorsement to executions of juveniles.
The United States and Somalia, he said, are the only nations that have not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which prohibits such executions, and of eight countries that have executed minors since 1990, all but the United States have abolished or disavowed the practice.
His observation reignited a debate over the court's consideration of foreign laws and legal opinions when interpreting the Constitution.
The court has noted international views in some recent rulings, including its 2002 decision on the retarded and its 2003 decision overturning state sodomy laws.
Justice Antonin Scalia, the leading critic of the court's practice, noted caustically Tuesday that the majority has not followed the same course in rulings on abortion, where foreign laws are more restrictive.
"What these foreign sources 'affirm' ,is the justices' own notion of how the world ought to be," Scalia said in a dissenting opinion.
Tuesday's ruling overturns laws in 20 states that applied the death penalty to minors, and commutes death sentences to life in prison for 73 inmates in 13 of those states 2 percent of the more than 3400 death row inmates nationwide.
The case that led to the ruling involved a Missouri youth, Christopher Simmons, who was 17 in 1993 when he and a friend kidnapped Shirley Crook, bound and gagged her and threw her off a bridge.
Prosecutors said Simmons, who had no criminal record, told his friends they could get away with the killing because of their age.
Briefs urging the court to ban juvenile executions were filed by major medical and mental health organizations, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, and several Nobel Peace Prize winners, including former President Jimmy Carter.
"With this ruling, the United States ,joins the community of nations, which uniformly renounces this practice," Carter said Tuesday.
UC Berkeley law professor Franklin Zimring, a death penalty scholar and opponent, said the ruling continued the court's recent trend of narrowing capital punishment laws nationwide.
The justices may impose further restrictions by scrutinizing procedural flaws and defense lawyers' competence, but are unlikely to decree wholesale changes in the near future, he said.
But Mark Levin, president of the conservative Landmark Legal Foundation and a death penalty supporter, said the ruling illustrated judicial activism at its worst.
"I suspect, down the road based on this reasoning, the court will eventually ban the death penalty," he added.
In overturning its 1989 decision that allowed executions of 16 year olds, the court followed its late 20th century doctrine that judged cruel and unusual punishment by "evolving standards of decency."
Under that principle, the court has condemned punishments it once tolerated for example, the death penalty for rape, outlawed by a 1977 ruling.
Since 1989, Kennedy said, five states have prohibited the death penalty for juveniles, no state has lowered its age for executions, and juries have become increasingly reluctant to sentence minors to death.
Counting the 12 states without death penalty laws, he said, 30 states now prohibit executions of murderers under 18, the same total that banned executions of the retarded at the time of the 2002 ruling.
Those developments contrast with the popularity of tough on crime legislation in general and a crackdown on juvenile crime in particular, Kennedy said, and "provide sufficient evidence that today our society views juveniles ,as categorically less culpable than the average criminal."
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor dissented, saying she was not persuaded that a national consensus against juvenile executions exists or that jurors were incapable of singling out a mature, "especially depraved" juvenile murderer for the death penalty.
Scalia, in a dissent joined by Justice Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice William Rehnquist, derided the majority for discarding both the court's 1989 ruling and a punishment that was permitted when the Constitution was adopted two centuries earlier.
"The court ,proclaims itself sole arbiter of our nation's moral standards," Scalia said, rejecting the notion that the Constitution's meaning "should be determined by the subjective views of five members of this court and like minded foreigners."
The case is Roper vs. Simmons, 03 633.
This editorial appeared in Wednesday's Los Angeles Times: The U.S. Supreme Court's decision Tuesday to bar the execution of juvenile murderers has come at a pivotal time in this nation's long and agonized debate over the death penalty.
Unlike in the cases of the 100 plus death row defendants released in recent years when DNA or other evidence proved them innocent, Christopher Simmons' guilt was not in doubt.
Simmons was 17 and a Missouri high school junior when he and a friend entered Shirley Crook's house, bound the 46 year old woman with duct tape, drove her to a state park and threw her from a bridge to drown in the water below.
Before the crime, Simmons bragged to friends that they would "get away with it" because they were minors.
Soon after his arrest, he not only confessed to Crook's murder but agreed to perform a videotaped re enactment for police.
A jury sentenced him to death.
The question before the high court was the fairness and propriety of Simmons' sentence.
Capital punishment is reserved for society's worst offenders, wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy for a sharply divided court.
But because teens are still emotionally immature, they cannot be held responsible in the same degree as adults for their actions, however unforgivable.
For that reason, their execution violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.
"The age of 18 is the point where society draws the line for many purposes between childhood and adulthood," Kennedy wrote.
"It is, we conclude, the age at which the line for death eligibility ought to rest."
Tuesday's ruling throws out the sentences of 72 murderers in 12 of the 20 states that permit capital prosecutions of defendants who were under 18 at the time of their crimes.
California law reserves the death penalty for offenders 18 and over.
Opinion polls show Americans softening in their support for the death penalty.
Learning that so many innocent defendants spent years on death row before being exonerated has shaken many death penalty proponents.
The high court's new ruling comes three years after it outlawed the death penalty for the mentally retarded.
Both decisions were pointedly grounded in what the court describes as a changing national consensus on capital punishment.
But, as with the headline making exonerations, those decisions magnify as well as reflect the public's doubts.
Add in many other obvious inequities name a rich person awaiting execution, for one and death row is increasingly revealed for what it is: a dumping ground for the poorest defendants with the lousiest lawyers rather than the most despicable killers.
Somewhere William J. Brennan is smiling.
Not a face splitting beam, you understand, because four members of his beloved Supreme Court still believe it's just fine to execute 16 and 17 year olds.
But a pleased, reflected gleam, nonetheless, because the death penalty is one small step closer to being removed as the scourge of a civilized nation that should know better.
Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun are, somewhere, smiling, too.
But I focus on Brennan because it was he, who in 1989 near the end of his 34 years as an associate justice, wrote the blistering dissent as the Supreme Court upheld capital punishment for adolescents.
Brennan featured in his erudite opinion many of the concepts that seemed settled in Supreme Court analysis until the wrecking crew of William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas came along.
"Evolving standards of decency."
"Contemporary attitudes."
"Proportionality."
Brennan also skewered Scalia's "misplaced disdain" for scientific evidence, which in the plurality opinion Scalia had sought to ridicule as "ethicoscientific."
Well, let's hear it for the "ethicoscientific."
Because in good measure, that, along with those pesky evolving standards, is exactly what five justices relied on Tuesday, in Roper v. Simmons, to rule that executing 16 and 17 year olds violates the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.
As a leader of the American Psychiatric Association, one of several medical groups that favored banning juvenile executions, noted Tuesday, the decision acknowledges "that the brains of adolescents function in fundamentally different ways than the brains of adults."
It is an especially important ruling for Texas, which is home to more than one third of the nation's death row population in under 18 cases.
It is also another rebuke to the death penalty zealotry of much of the state's political establishment.
Their enchantment with executing juveniles put them in a very narrow league that included, until his recent dethronement, Saddam Hussein.
In a nice turn of history, as well as a symbol of how close was the vote, the latest opinion was written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, a member of Scalia's plurality 15 years ago.
Sadly and inexplicably, the new majority did not include Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who three years ago joined five other justices in striking down the death penalty for the mentally retarded.
O'Connor attempted and failed in a dissenting opinion Tuesday to parse why the social, medical and legal analyses that applied and were persuasive enough to her in the mental retardation case (Atkins v. Virginia) were not met in Roper.
Oh, well, opponents of the death penalty may have to learn to live with 5 4, assuming even that narrow count can be maintained if President Bush, a death penalty enthusiast, gets to make a Supreme Court nomination.
Little by little, since it reinstated the death penalty in 1976, the Supreme Court has whittled back the administration and application of capital punishment.
To the Scalias of the world, the idea of "evolving" standards or, even worse to them, an "evolving" interpretation of the Constitution, is some sort of perversion (unless, of course, it gets them to their political ends).
But as Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in a concurring opinion joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, if the meaning of the Eighth Amendment "had been frozen when it was originally drafted, it would impose no impediment on the execution of 7 year old children."
I'd hesitate to see that proposition brought to a vote in the Texas Legislature as currently constituted.
The Roper case is "a small tsunami," said Jeffrey Fagan, a Columbia University professor of law and public health.
"It's not a 30 foot wall of water but a 2 foot wall.
But that still is changing the landscape."
Opponents of the death penalty must acknowledge the narrowness of the vote that produced Tuesday's welcomed result in Roper but also recognize the modestly advantageous lay of the land.
"Proponents of the death penalty haven't had a win in a long time," Fagan said.
one."
The remainder of the journey is not likely to be short or easy or without setbacks, but with each step and at every turn it will be worthwhile.

The US Supreme Court on Tuesday abolished the death penalty for those convicted of crimes they committed as minors.
The US high court upheld an earlier ruling by the Missouri Supreme Court banning the execution of those convicted of crimes they committed before turning 18.
That ruling had found execution to be in violation of the constitutional protection against "cruel and unusual punishment."
The court had ruled in 1988 that the execution of offenders who were younger than 16 when they committed their crimes was unconstitutional, but a few US states continued to execute perpetrators who committed crimes at 16 or 17.
The court cited changing cultural standards for its decision.
The Supreme Court was considering the case of Christopher Simmons, who was condemned to death for the 1993 murder in Missouri of a woman who was abducted, tied up and thrown to her death from a bridge.
He was 17 at the time.
Simmons's attorney, Seth Waxman, had argued that the death penalty was a useless deterrent for minors, since "they weigh risks differently" than adults do.
In striking down the death penalty for juveniles earlier this month, the Supreme Court turned a decisive page in a debate that has raged for years over the role of international law in interpreting the Constitution.
Since 1988, the justices have sharply disputed whether to consider international norms in defining such concepts as "cruel and unusual punishments" and due process.
In Roper vs. Simmons, however, the 5 4 majority resoundingly supported the relevance of international law.
And Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's dissent nevertheless agreed that "the existence of an international consensus ,can serve to confirm the reasonableness of a consonant and genuine American consensus."
What a contrast to the prevailing isolationism of the Bush administration, which recently withdrew from the International Court of Justice's jurisdiction in response to the ICJ's ruling that the United States had violated the consular rights of Mexican nationals on death row.
Together, these events bring to the fore a dispute that is enduringly provocative, because it pits those who stress the uniqueness of the American constitutional system against those who emphasize what America shares with the global community.
It is a debate that ultimately raises the question of whether America's strength lies in its historical independence from the whims of global society or from its leadership role therein.
Roper was simply the most recent battleground on which Justices Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer have acted as spokesmen for the two opposing camps.
Scalia has asserted that "modern foreign legal materials can never be relevant to an interpretation of ,the meaning of the U.S.
Constitution."
In this, he is supported by Justice Clarence Thomas, who has protested the court's apparent willingness to "impose foreign moods, fads, or fashions on Americans."
Both men emphasize the singularity (and superiority) of the American system.
Breyer and at least five other members of the court, on the other hand, argue that international norms should inform our constitutional analysis in a world increasingly united by globalization, democratization and the spread of universal human rights.
The two camps have clashed over such political hot button issues in America's culture wars as the death penalty, abortion and gay rights.
But often overlooked in the debate is the fact that today's justices are not the first to wrestle with the need to find the appropriate balance between the two approaches.
The question was evident almost two centuries ago in a case arising from the War of 1812.
Chief Justice John Marshall, reflecting the Breyer view, wrote that "In expounding (the) Constitution, a construction ought not lightly to be admitted which would give to a declaration of war an effect in this country it does not possess elsewhere."
Marshall presumed that the Constitution would incorporate international norms.
Indeed, since the nation's founding, the court has often looked to international rules in a broad range of contexts to help define state powers within our federal system and to construe the commerce clause, the government's power over immigrants and the meaning of involuntary servitude and due process.
Even the current administration, while prominently flouting many of our international obligations, has sought sweeping powers from international rules that prove convenient.
Just last term, the Justice Department argued to the court that the president's authority to detain U.S. born alleged Taliban fighter Yaser Esam Hamdi derived from the international laws of war.
The court divided over the argument.
Four justices looked to international law both as supporting the president's power to detain and as imposing limits on that power.
Justices David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg in turn objected to the apparent contradiction in the administration's claim of powers recognized by the laws of war while failing to provide detainees the protections afforded by those same rules.
The ongoing disagreement over our relationship to international law reflects fundamentally different attitudes toward America's place in the international system.
Scalia, a stark proponent of American constitutional exceptionalism, looks back to the country's beginnings in urging that "if there was any thought absolutely foreign to the founders of our country, surely it was the notion that we Americans should be governed the way Europeans are."
He is doubtless correct that certain aspects of U.S. constitutional design deliberately rejected the practices of continental Europe.
These include our liberal free speech protections and the right to jury trial in civil and criminal cases, which was unknown outside of Great Britain at the founding.
Both now separate the United States even from British practice.
It is incorrect, however, to suggest that our entire constitutional system sets us apart from the international community.
The founders also worked from the assumption, set forth in the Declaration of Independence, that humanity shares a common set of inalienable rights.
The drafters of the Constitution were well versed in international law, and they intended the United States to take its place among the community of nations by adhering to international rules.
Thomas Jefferson considered the law of nations "an integral part ,of the laws of the land," and John Jay, one of the authors of the Federalist Papers and the first chief justice of the United States, proclaimed that "the United States had, by taking a place among the nations of the earth, become amenable to the laws of nations."
Indeed, compliance with international law was critical to prevent the fledgling nation from offending powerful foreign states.
Therefore, it would be surprising if the founders expected the government's powers to be construed in isolation from international rules.
Similarly, the general concepts of individual rights such as "liberty" and "cruel and unusual punishments" that the drafters incorporated into the Constitution reasonably invoke the fundamental values of the international community.
In short, while some constitutional traditions may be unique to the American experience, other aspects of our heritage invite consideration of international rules.
This dialogue between international and constitutional values has been largely lost to modern jurisprudence, as the use of international law has become a political football in our charged social debates over the death penalty and gay rights.
Each side of the Scalia/Breyer debate today contends that its approach does the most to protect fundamental liberties.
In reality, however, international law does not point in any particular direction in promoting individual rights.
Take abortion as an example: International law, in the form of treaties and customary international norms, is essentially silent on the subject.
The practices of foreign nations, on the other hand, run the gamut from absolute prohibition to liberal abortion laws.
And while Scalia notes that most countries around the world impose greater restrictions on abortion than the United States, most advanced industrial democracies broadly protect abortion rights.
Abortion, in other words, stands in stark contrast to the juvenile death penalty: The United States was the only country in the world that continued to officially sanction the penalty, and the practice placed the United States in the lonely company of such notorious human rights violators as Yemen and Iran.
Scalia frequently criticizes the modern court for selectively citing foreign sources that support its views while ignoring practices abroad that contradict our constitutional norms.
And history shows that international law can be abused.
In the 1857 Dred Scott case, the chief justice of that period, Roger B. Taney, infamously invoked foreign practices to conclude that the framers did not intend to bestow citizenship on African descendants.
But where international rules would have supported freeing Dred Scott from slavery, Taney rejected their relevance.
The fact that international sources like all interpretive sources may be abused, however, is an argument that they should be used with integrity, not that they should not be used at all.
Over a century ago, the court observed that "The Constitution of the United States was ,made for an undefined and expanding future, and for a people gathered, and to be gathered, from many nations and of many tongues, and while we take just pride in the principles and institutions of the common law, we are not to forget that in lands where other systems of jurisprudence prevail, the ideas and processes of civil justice are also not unknown."
Those who seek to differentiate the American system from the international community fail to recognize that the United States is a participant in the making of international law, from international trade rules to international humanitarian law.
The use of international law does not mean we should follow it blindly.
But willfully ignoring those rules both brings the United States into conflict with other nations, as with the juvenile death penalty, and hampers our ability to invoke international rules from which we wish to benefit.
International law has been a part of our law from the beginning, and its use in constitutional analysis is part of the American tradition.

Eight months has made a lifetime of difference for Christopher Simmons.
Because Simmons was that many months shy of his 18th birthday when he tossed a woman to her death off a railroad trestle, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that he cannot be executed for the murder.
The ruling in Simmons' case also spared the life of 72 death row inmates across the nation who were younger than 18 when they committed murder and bars states from seeking to execute minors for future crimes.
For Simmons, now 28, it means a long life in prison for which he is eternally grateful.
Learning of the court decision from a television report, Simmons tried unsuccessfully to call his family, then got through to one of his attorneys.
"The first thing he said was, 'Thank you very, very much,'" said Kansas City attorney Pat Berrigan, whose client denied an interview request.
Simmons had been praying fervently for the nation's high court to uphold a 2003 decision by the Missouri Supreme Court that banned juvenile executions, Berrigan said.
"I think he sees some of God's work in this result," he said.
In its 5 4 ruling, the high court said the execution of juvenile offenders violates the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment.
The decision invalidated the practice of 19 states and overturned a 1989 high court precedent in another Missouri case that had allowed executions for offenders as young as 16.
It also brought the United States in line with much of the rest of the world, something Justice Anthony Kennedy noted while concluding that juveniles lack the maturity and intellectual development to understand the ramifications of their actions.
"The age of 18 is the point where society draws the line for many purposes between childhood and adulthood.
It is, we conclude, the age at which the line for death eligibility ought to rest," Kennedy wrote for the court's majority.
In dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia disputed that a "national consensus" exists against juvenile executions and insisted those decisions should be left to states.
The impact was immediate.
In Prince William County, Virginia, officials said Tuesday they will not prosecute a murder case against teen sniper Lee Boyd Malvo, who already is serving life in prison in two of the 10 sniper killings that terrorized the Washington area in 2002.
The ruling continues the court's practice of narrowing the scope of the death penalty, which it reinstated in 1976.
Executions for those 15 and younger when they committed their crimes were outlawed in 1988.
Three years ago, justices banned executions of the mentally retarded, citing a "national consensus" against executing a killer who may lack the intelligence to fully understand his crime.
In finding a similar consensus against juvenile executions, the court noted that most states bar them and those that allow them do so infrequently.
Only three states Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia have executed people who committed crimes as juveniles in the past 10 years.
The latest case arose from the September 1993 murder of Shirley Crook, who was bound up during a nighttime burglary by Simmons and 15 year old Charles Benjamin.
She was taken from her home wearing only underwear and cowboy boots and shoved off a train trestle into the Meramec River.
Prosecutors contended Simmons planned the killing and bragged he could escape punishment because of his age, something Simmons later denied.
Crook's relatives criticized the Supreme Court's conclusion that juveniles aren't as culpable for their actions as adults.
"We felt it was a cold blooded murder," said Tom Mitchell, whose wife, Pertie, is Crook's sister.
"I don't know that life in prison is ever considered a pass, but he's not having to pay the same penalty that he caused Pertie's sister to pay."
Jefferson County Prosecutor Bob Wilkins, who took office just months after Simmons' trial, said he still believes it is appropriate to allow the death penalty for some teenage murderers.
"If any case ever was deserving of the death penalty, this was it," Wilkins said.
"It was one of the most heinous offenses that any of us ever are going to see."
Since entering prison, Simmons has embraced his Christian faith, joined several ministry and youth programs and helped as a hospice aide caring for inmates with AIDS, Berrigan said.
In January, Simmons was transferred to the same prison cell block as Benjamin, who was tried separately and sentenced to life in prison.
The two co defendants have occasionally talked about their fates, Benjamin said in a telephone interview Tuesday from prison.
Simmons wanted to live and had been anxiously awaiting the Supreme Court decision.
Benjamin said he would have preferred to have been executed, adding that a lifetime in prison should provide a strong deterrent to other teens.
"Maybe one of the youngsters out there someday will look back in time and see what happened to me and what happened to Chris and think, 'That's not really how I want to do things,'" Benjamin said.
The Supreme Court, concluding that both the United States and the world have turned against the death penalty for youthful offenders, ruled Tuesday that the Constitution categorically bars capital punishment for crimes committed before the age of 18.
The 5 to 4 decision, which upheld a ruling by the Missouri Supreme Court, will move 72 people off death row in 12 states.
It represented an about face for a court that only 16 years ago had rejected the argument that the execution of those who kill at the age of 16 or 17 violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against "cruel and unusual punishments."
Writing for the court on Tuesday, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who voted with the majority 16 years ago, said not only did 30 states five more than 16 years ago reject the death penalty for juveniles, but that "it is fair to say that the United States now stands alone in a world that has turned its face against the juvenile death penalty."
There have been 19 such executions in the United States since 1990, most recently in 2003.
Once the Supreme Court agreed in January of last year to decide the issue, all executions that might be affected by the eventual decision were put on hold.
Justice Antonin Scalia, the author of the court's last ruling on the subject, Stanford v. Kentucky, filed a dissent from the new decision in Roper v. Simmons, No. 03 633.
Joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas, Scalia disputed nearly every one of the majority's points, from how to count the various states to whether reference to the views of foreign legal systems has any relevance or legitimacy.
The defendant in the case, Christopher Simmons, argued that the same standards that apply to mentally retarded killers should be applied to juvenile offenders.
The Missouri Supreme Court agreed, noting that five states since 1989, either by legislation or judicial decision, had raised the minimum age to 18.
It ordered Simmons resentenced to life in prison without parole.
In the days leading up to a white supremacist march, ministers pleaded with residents in the predominantly black neighborhood to stay calm and community leaders organized peace rallies.
Authorities even delayed releasing the route so protesters wouldn't know where the group planned to march.
It wasn't enough to stop an angry mob that included gang members from looting and burning a neighborhood bar, smashing the windows of a gas station and hurling rocks and bottles at police on Saturday.
Twelve officers were injured, one suffering a concussion when a brick flew through her cruiser window.
In all, 114 people were arrested on charges including assault, vandalism, failure to disperse and overnight curfew violations.
"We knew during the preparation that it was going to be a tremendous challenge," Police Chief Mike Navarre said Sunday.
"Anyone who would accuse us of being underprepared I would take exception with that."
Much of the anger boiled over because people were upset that city leaders were willing to allow the supremacists to walk through the neighborhood and shout insults, residents and authorities said.
"You can't allow people to come challenge a whole city and not think they weren't going to strike back," said Kenneth Allen, 47, who watched the violence begin near his home.
Authorities said there was little they could do to stop the group, because they did not apply for a parade permit and instead planned to walk along sidewalks.
"They do have a right to walk on the Toledo sidewalks," said Mayor Jack Ford, who at one point confronted leaders of the mob and tried to settle them down.
A gang member in a mask threatened to shoot him, and others cursed him for allowing the march, the mayor said.
He said he didn't know if the man who threatened him was actually armed, but he blamed gangs for much of the violence.
The march had been called off because of the crowds, and the white supremacists had left.
If the Nazi group tries to come back, Ford said he would seek a court order to stop them.
Navarre said the riots escalated because members of the National Socialist Movement took their protest to the neighborhood, which is predominantly black, instead of a neutral place.
"If this march had occurred in downtown Toledo, we wouldn't have had the unrest," he said.
The neighborhood northwest of downtown, full of tree lined streets and well kept brick homes, once was a thriving Polish community.
But within the last decade it's become home to poorer residents.
The neo Nazi group, known as "America's Nazi Party," said they came to the city because of a dispute between neighbors, one white and the other black.
Police began receiving word midweek from officers on the street that gangs were going to descend on the neighborhood in protest, the police chief said.
The disturbances were confined to a 1 square mile (2.6 square kilometer) area, but the crowd swelled to about 600 people, overwhelming police.
The crowds were eventually dispersed by police in riot gear after about four hours, and the mayor declared a state of emergency that remained in effect through the weekend.
About 200 officers patrolled the neighborhood overnight after the riot, Navarre said.
Police reported no problems Sunday, but an 8 p.m. curfew was in effect for a second night.
Neighbors were divided about the city allowing the march.
"They don't have the right to bring hate to my front yard," said Terrance Anderson, who lives near a bar that was destroyed.
Other neighbors said the group had a right to have their say.
"Too bad the people couldn't ignore them," said Dee Huntley.
A crowd protesting a white supremacists' march turned violent, throwing baseball sized rocks at police, vandalizing vehicles and stores, and setting fire to a neighborhood bar, authorities said.
When Mayor Jack Ford and a local minister tried to calm the rioting Saturday, they were cursed for allowing the march, and Ford said a masked gang member threatened to shoot him.
At least 65 people were arrested and several police officers were injured before calm was restored about four hours later.
Ford blamed the rioting on gangs taking advantage of a volatile situation.
He declared a state of emergency, set an 8 p.m. (0000 GMT) curfew through the weekend, and asked the Highway Patrol for help.
"It's exactly what they wanted," Ford said of the group that planned the march, which was canceled because of the rioting.
At least two dozen members of the National Socialist Movement, which calls itself "America's Nazi Party," had gathered at a city park to march under police protection.
Organizers said they were demonstrating against black gangs they said were harassing white residents.
The violence broke out about one quarter of a mile away along the planned march route shortly before it was to begin.
One group of men pounded on a convenience store, and others overturned vehicles.
There was a report of a shooting but police hadn't found a victim, Police Chief Mike Navarre said.
About 150 police officers chased bands of young men through the area.
Officers wearing gas masks fired tear gas canisters and flash bang devices designed to stun suspects, but the groups continued throwing rocks and bottles.
Several officers and firefighters suffered minor injuries, Navarre said.
At one point, the crowd reached 600 people, officials said.
Finally, police marched shoulder to shoulder down the street shouting to people to stay inside, and the crowd of several hundred broke up.
At least 65 people were arrested on charges including assault, vandalism, failure to obey police and failure to disperse, Navarre said.
He said the white supremacists had left hours earlier.
"We frankly could have made a couple hundred arrests easily," Navarre said.
"We just didn't have the resources on hand to arrest all of them."
The mayor had appealed to residents the night before to ignore the march.
He said the city wouldn't give the Nazi group a permit to march in the streets but couldn't stop them from walking on the sidewalks.
When the rioting began, Ford tried to negotiate with those involved, but "they weren't interested in that."
He said people in the crowd swore at him and wanted to know why he was protecting the Nazis.
They were mostly "gang members who had real or imagined grievances and took it as an opportunity to speak in their own way," Ford said.
"I was chagrined that there were obvious mothers and children in the crowd with them," he said.
Thomas Frisch, 76, said a large group of men destroyed the exterior of a gas station next to his home of 30 years.
"A whole big gang started to come in here.
Next thing you know, they're jumping on the car.
Then they overturned it.
Then they started on the building, breaking windows, ripping the bars off," he said.
Louis Ratajski, 86, and his nephew, Terry Rybczynski, left Jim & Lou's Bar as a crowd gathered in front pelting police with rocks and breaking the windows.
They climbed down a fire escape from the apartment where Ratajski lived over the bar and only later saw the fire on television.
"I was shaking.
I feared for my life."
Rybczynski said.
Keith White, a black resident, criticized city officials for allowing the march in the first place.
"They let them come here and expect this not to happen?" said White, 29.
A spokesman for the National Socialist Movement blamed police for losing control of the situation.
Rioting erupted Saturday in an impoverished neighborhood of Toledo, Ohio after hundreds of counter protestors broke up a planned march by a neo Nazi group, Toledo police confirmed.
Scores of rioters rampaged through streets wrecking cars and setting a building on fire in north Toledo after police fired tear gas on the anti Nazi group.
Six people were arrested, according to Fox News.
The violence broke out after a group of nearly 80 white supremacists of the Virigina based National Socialist Movement assembled for a march against what they called black gang violence against whites in the Toledo neighborhood.
Bob White, leader of the movement, said police forced his group to disband after the protestors gathered around them and began to throw stones.
"The police lost total control of the situation," he told AFP.
"We were protesting black racial violence against white people in that neighborhood," said White.
But a local politician said that the multi ethnic neighborhood was not particularly beset by violence.
"That neighborhood has never been known for racial tensions," city councilman Robert McCloskey told Fox.
In a small industrial park west of Keller, Texas, near sprawling neighborhoods and new schools, a storage facility routinely receives shipments of merchandise geared toward a certain clientele white supremacists and anti Semites.
An FBI joint task force knows about the place and the people who operate it.
So do the Tarrant County Sheriff's Department and a national watchdog group that monitors hate groups nationwide.
Aryan Wear, an online clothing, music and book outlet that opposes Jews and promotes white supremacy, keeps much of its merchandise in the storage stall near Fort Worth.
Incorporated by Fort Worth man, Aryan Wear is one of 10 hate and racially intolerant operations in Dallas Fort Worth, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is based in Montgomery, Ala., and tracks extremist groups.
While most such groups' members are open about their views, the operators of Aryan Wear remain for the most part anonymous, letting their online sales pitches spread their message.
"You don't really have my permission to use my name in your article pertaining to this.
I think this pretty much seals the deal," said a phone message left at the Fort Worth Star Telegram by Tony Eynon, who is named as Aryan Wear's president and lone director in corporate records filed with the Texas secretary of state's office in Austin.
A pilot who was until recently licensed to fly Boeing 737s commercially, Eynon, 30, declined to be interviewed, saying in his phone message that he had recently sold Aryan Wear and that "there's just the finalization of paperwork right now."
He lives with his wife and young child in a well established neighborhood down the street from a black family and a Hispanic family in a home no different from any other on the block until, neighbors say, the garage door rises, revealing a large Confederate flag on the wall.
Joe Roy, chief researcher for the law center's magazine, the Intelligence Report, called Aryan Wear a "hate for profit" business, a kind of one stop shopping for the fashion needs of white supremacists."
The Web site's merchandise includes a T shirt that declares, "Deport Pedro," another with a picture of Adolf Hitler and the inscription "I was right," and a third with a design similar to a Tide detergent logo but altered to say, "Pride ,For a Whiter, Brighter Future!"
Aryan Wear's signature product, however, is a high laced boot with swastikas carved in the sole, allowing its wearer to leave an impression of the Nazi symbol on soft ground.
"An outstanding product real skinheads can be proud to be associated with," one wearer said in a review on the Aryan Wear Web site.
The reviewed called the boots "Too White ,!"
Roy said the boots were created by Eynon's friend Christopher Evans, who was connected with the violence prone Confederate Hammerskins in Dallas and now lives in the Fort Worth area.
Evans could not be reached for comment.
Initially, Roy said, the boots were sold to make money for the National Alliance.
But the once powerful neo Nazi organization is now in turmoil, with declining membership, since the death of its longtime leader, William Pierce, in 2002.
Roy said the boots were the alliance's biggest moneymaker until August 2003 when Eynon formed Aryan Wear as a Texas company and began selling the boots exclusively.
A man identifying himself as Jim Reid, who lives near Austin, said in a recent telephone interview that Eynon is no longer associated with Aryan Wear and that he is the new president and chief executive officer.
There are three "primary" owners, in Houston, Florida and New Jersey, and the new owners want to remain "silent partners," Reid said.
He denied that the business promotes hatred or that its products including the "Happy Hitler Baby Doll" T shirt are overly radical.
"It doesn't have anything to do with hate," Reid said.
"We want to basically present a positive image to the youth and the public in general."
Local officials are not impressed.
"I'm glad that authorities are aware of this operation and are keeping an eye on it," said Roy Brooks, a leader in the local African American community and a member of the Tarrant County Commissioners Court.
"We can't legislate good taste or human compassion.
I wish we could," Brooks said.
Lori Bailey, a spokeswoman for the FBI in North Texas, said federal authorities are "keenly aware" of Aryan Wear because of its apparent association with the sometimes violent skinhead movement.
Bailey said, however, that the FBI can do little because the business is not breaking the law.
Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson agreed that he saw nothing illegal in Aryan Wear's business tactics.
Still, Anderson said, "they are clearly tied to the white supremacist movement, if you look at the types of merchandise they're offering, "I think anytime anybody deals in that type of activity, it's a concern for law enforcement," Anderson said.
"It certainly bears watching."

A city council candidate dropped out of the race Friday after it was disclosed that he posted comments to a white supremacist Internet bulletin board more than 4000 times.
Doug Hanks said the postings were fictional and designed to win white supremacists' trust as he researched a novel he was writing.
He said the book was also meant to appeal to white supremacists.
"I needed information for the book and some other writings I was doing," Hanks told The Associated Press on Friday.
"I did what I thought I needed to do to establish myself as a credible white nationalist."
Hanks had filed papers seeking the Republican nomination for one of four at large council seats, but formally withdrew Friday, said county elections director Michael Dickerson.
Hanks' postings over the past three years were first reported by The Rhinoceros Times, a weekly newspaper.
In one June 1 posting, he said blacks should be treated like "rabid beasts."
Hanks said his self published novel, called "Patriot Act," takes themes from "The Turner Diaries" the racist novel believed to have inspired Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.
"I saw how successful these 'Turner Diaries' had been and that was the path to take," he told the AP.
White supremacists, he said, "have more of a tendency to word of mouth, to say, 'Hey, you ought to pick this up.'"
Republican Mayor Pat McCrory condemned Hanks.
"He's a man of total inner hatred in both his heart and soul, and it doesn't matter what party he's in," McCrory said.
White supremacists clashed with an angry crowd outside Faneuil Hall, where Holocaust survivors and their families were commemorating the liberation of Nazi concentration camps.
Two people were arrested during Sunday's confrontation, officer John Boyle said.
Sunday was the 60th anniversary of the end of the Allied victory over Nazi Germany.
Inside the historic meeting house, Holocaust survivors, their children and grandchildren lit white candles to commemorate the estimated 6 million Jews killed by the Nazis.
Germany's consul general to New England, Wolfgang Vorwerk, spoke of his country's role.
Outside, 10 to 15 members of the Arkansas based group White Revolution were escorted by officers to a designated protest area across the street.
The officers, many in riot gear, formed a barricade between the protesters and about 100 people who angrily shouted at them to leave Boston.
Two people were charged with disturbing the peace after a scuffle outside the protest area.
Police said Shireen Chambers, 36, of Boston, who is white, struck a black man, Jerome Higins, 25, of Everett, and he retaliated by spitting in her face and hitting her with a sign.
Boyle said at least one officer was injured while arresting Chambers, who yelled racist epithets as she was dragged away.
Gov. Mitt Romney, who attended the Faneuil Hall event, said he was disgusted by the presence of the supremacists.
"Today of all days, to have white supremacists come here from Arkansas, is most disappointing," he said.
"I wish they'd go back home where the came from and bury themselves under the rocks that they crawled out from."
A white Republican lawmaker who contends he was excluded from a Black legislative group solely because of his race said Tuesday that the group is even more racist than the Ku Klux Klan.
"My understanding is that the KKK doesn't even ban members by race," Rep Stacey Campfield, a lawmaker from Knoxville, told The Associated Press, adding that the KKK "has less racist bylaws" than the black lawmakers' group.
Earlier this year, Campfield was promptly rebuffed when he inquired about joining the Black Caucus.
He had earlier said he wanted to join the group to find out how it spends its money.
There are 18 black state lawmakers in Tennessee and Campfield's request was deemed to have been made from a "strange guy" who was simply interested in stirring up trouble.
"I definitely think they should allow white people in as members," Campfield said.
"If we work together we might be able to pull things off and get things done."
Tennessee Black Caucus member Rep Larry Miller, a Democrat, said no white lawmaker has ever asked to join.
He acknowledged the group's bylaws mention only black lawmakers but said it might consider admitting a white lawmaker not necessarily Campfield who is "using this as a joke."
Campfield posted a message on his Web journal, or blog, last week about his unsuccessful attempt to join the black lawmakers' group.
On Saturday, under the heading "I too dream," Campfield posted long excerpts from the Rev. Martin Luther King's famous 1963 "I Have a Dream" speech in which King dreams of a day when his children "will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."
This use of King's speech infuriated some readers, and Campfield announced Monday that he was banning reader comments on his blog after some of the postings included death threats.
"People just started going crazy about it," Campfield said.
Experts on race and hate groups said Campfield hit a nerve when he used King's words to take on a black institution.
It's the same tactic white separatists often use, said Mark Potok, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center.
"Very typically these days we see white supremacists, hate groups, trying to use the words of King and other civil rights leaders to try to advance their agendas," Potok said.
On his blog, 37 year old Campfield has also derided gay adoption and abortion.
Although Campfield said he still believes the blog is a good idea, it will now carry only his posts, along with a little biographical information such as his interests in judo and karate, and a listing of the Bible as his favorite book.
"You could abort every black baby in this country, and the crime rate would go down."
William Bennett, radio talk show host and former U.S. education secretary WASHINGTON A protest demonstration is scheduled for Wednesday at the Salem Radio Network in Arlington, Va., where William Bennett works.
And a boycott of the sponsors of his show is being organized.
In drumming up support for these actions, one e mailer called Bennett a racist and eugenicist and declared, "That's how Hitler got started."
There is a problem here.
But it's not Bennett, whose comments illuminated a moral inconsistency in black America that is far more harmful than anything he said.
Forget about Bennett's absurd crime cure a proposal he acknowledged would be morally wrong and just look at the most recent analysis of abortion data, released in July by the Alan Guttmacher Institute.
African American women, who make up only 13 percent of the U.S. female population, accounted for 32 percent of the 1293000 abortions performed in the United States in 2002.
That's 413760 abortions performed on black women in one year or 1133 a day.
(In Washington, half of all pregnancies ended in abortion, a higher percentage than in any state.)
No outcry over that because those were just disposable fetuses, right?
That is, until Bennett spoke of aborting "black babies," and suddenly those fetuses become precious pre born black people who must be saved from the evil Dr Bill.
It's just a different twist to the same old story.
If the Ku Klux Klan were killing blacks the way blacks kill blacks, we'd be up in arms.
If whites in blackface were filling the airways with degrading lyrics and minstrel shows, we'd at least shoot the TV and radio.
But as along as it's just us acting a fool, who cares?
This is the consequence of our corrosive moral inconsistency: a dependence on the opposition of whites to give meaning and value to black life.
Robert Woodson Sr., president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, puts it bluntly.
"There are black people who share the beliefs of white supremacists and who, by their actions, concede that white people hold the keys to everything we are and can become," he said in a telephone interview.
"The feeling is, 'Unless they change, we can't change.'
" As I've noted before, even our immune system is compromised by the stress of such a frenzied, mothlike attraction to white slights.
Worst of all, we know better and still can't seem to stop ourselves.
"Our health is our responsibility," said Jackson L. Davis III, a urologist and coordinator of men's health initiatives at the D.C. Department of Health.
He spoke at a recent health conference for black men at Howard University.
And he meant all aspects of our health: mental, physical, emotional and spiritual.
"At health fairs, when I ask our young people what are their top health concerns, they say, 'To go to school or a party and not get shot,' " Davis said.
No one at the conference jumped up to blame the white man.
Atiba Coppock, an educational psychologist based in the District, called on black men to assume their responsibilities as husbands and fathers and suggested new ways to build character in our black boys.
"Traditional African education focused on integrity, and we need to refocus on that," Coppock said.
"The goal was to build a person who was going to be godlike, in other words, your whole focus is to be the best person you can be spiritually, and that impacts those around you and the community in which you live."
Jules P. Harrell, a professor and acting chairman of Howard's Department of Psychology, said African Americans need to "cultivate a new sense of body," one rooted in health and self respect and not in popular culture, such as rap music videos.
To that end, we might welcome the controversy about abortion and black babies and the long overdue focus it brings to the black womb home to hope unbound as well as unspeakable tragedy.
Who is responsible for the protection and care of this amazing uterine environment, where the most wonderful fetal programming can occur just by having a loving husband kiss his pregnant wife?
Bennett?
Sorry, he ain't in it.
For Joan Humphrey Lefkow, the nightmare began shortly after her 2000 appointment as a federal judge, when an Oregon group's lawsuit to block white supremacists from using a name it had trademarked, World Church of the Creator, landed in her lap.
Soon, Lefkow found her home address and family photographs posted along with violent threats on hate filled Websites, and last April, one of the Aryan movement's most notorious leaders was convicted of plotting her murder.
On Tuesday, Lefkow sat sequestered under armed federal guard in an undisclosed location, mourning her husband of 30 years and her 89 year old mother, whom she found dead of gunshots to the head in their basement the day before, sending her screaming into the quiet street.
"I think she's very upset with herself, maybe, for being a judge and putting her family in this danger," said Laura Lefkow, 20, the third of the judge's five daughters, "but there's no way she should have known."
Local and federal law enforcement officials said on Tuesday that they were investigating possible connections between the double murder and Matthew Hale, the white supremacist currently in federal prison for soliciting Lefkow's assassination, or his many sympathizers.
Federal officials in Washington said agents were scrubbing Lefkow's entire caseload in search of suspects, with the main thrust on the hate groups that had targeted her before.
Already, some white supremacists were celebrating the killings on the Internet, while others spun conspiracy theories that the crime was committed by Hale's enemies to poison the atmosphere before his sentencing next month.
Experts who have spent years tracking Hale's organization now called Creativity also pointed to the upcoming sentencing, noting that one of his acolytes, Benjamin Smith, went on a shooting spree in 1999 after Hale was rejected by the Illinois bar.
"We saw what happened the last time Matt Hale got slapped in the face by the system: The price of that was two dead and nine severely wounded," said Mark Potok, director of intelligence for the Southern Poverty Law Center.
"Now Matt Hale is about to be sentenced, very probably, to most of his natural life to federal prison.
It's very possible that a Hale follower or sympathizer has decided to fight back."
Billy Roper, a friend of Hale's who is chairman of a group called White Revolution, disavowed the violence but offered a different parallel: the FBI's 1992 confrontation in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, with the white separatist Randall C. Weaver, whose wife and 14 year old son wound up dead.
"We can stand alongside the federal law enforcement community in saying just as they felt a deep regret and sadness over the death of Randy Weaver's family so we also feel a deep sense of regret and sadness over the death of Judge Lefkow's family," Roper said.
"If it was the case that someone was misguided and thought that they were helping Matt Hale, then it would be similar in that other people had suffered for one person's mistake."
Hale, who is representing himself, faces up to 40 years in prison, and has been held for two years in the Metropolitan Correctional Center here under special administrative measures, reserved for terrorists, that limited contact with the outside world.
Federal officials refused to discuss the restrictions, but his mother, Evelyn Hutcheson, said that she and his father are the only people he is allowed contact with, and that they are limited to 15 minute phone calls each Thursday morning, and separate hourlong visits twice a month.
"He had nothing to do with what went on last night," Hutcheson said in a telephone interview from her home in East Peoria, Ill.
"My son is sitting in a hole where he's not allowed to even speak loud enough to be audible.
"Common sense would tell you, if he were into having somebody kill somebody which he is not would he have somebody go kill the judge's family just before he's sentenced?" she added.
"Somebody has done this to make him get an enhanced sentence."
The authorities cautioned that it is too soon to focus on any one theory of the crime, though they did not offer other possible scenarios or motives.
Casings from .22 caliber bullets were found at the scene, and the medical examiner cited the cause of death as multiple gunshot wounds.
James Molloy, the Chicago Police Department's chief of detectives, said the murders happened between 10:30 a.m., when Lefkow's mother answered a telephone call from one of her granddaughters, and 5:30 p.m. when the judge returned home.
At 4 p.m., the Lefkows' youngest daughter, Margaret, 16, came home to get her gym bag and left without seeing anyone in the house, Molloy said.
"There is much speculation about possible links between this crime and the possible involvement of hate groups," he said at a news conference.
"This is but one facet of our investigation.
We are looking in many, many directions."
Hiram Grau, the department's deputy superintendent, said: "The questions you have are the same ones we have and we are working around the clock to get them answered."
Shannon Metzger, a spokesman for the U.S.
Marshal's service, said that Lefkow had a special protective detail for "a couple of weeks" last year, but it was disbanded when the threats against her were deemed "not viable."
Molloy said the Chicago police also had stopped its practice of sending cars to her home for additional patrols, and Lefkow, her daughter, said the authorities had long ago removed the security cameras it had installed in their home.
"I guess because the FBI felt it seemed like there was no danger," said Laura Lefkow, a sophomore at Pomona College in Southern California.
But on Monday night, federal marshals met Laura Lefkow's plane from Los Angeles, and they stood guard on Tuesday as the family planned Saturday funerals for Michael F. Lefkow, 64, an attorney who was a leader in the Episcopal church, and Donna Humphrey, 89, an ailing grandmother who hand stitched quilts for each of her 23 descendants.
Michael Lefkow, who ran unsuccessfully for Cook County judge in 2002 and 2004, argued two cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and worked for the Legal Aid Society and the U.S. Postal Service before starting a solo firm about 20 years ago.
He spent every Sunday at St. Luke's in Evanston, flirting with the elderly women in the pews, and since 1992 had been a lay member of the governing committee of the Chicago Diocese of the Episcopal Church.
A flamenco dancer and tennis player, Lefkow met his future wife in the library of Wheaton College, where she was an undergraduate.
"She was doing a paper on Indonesia and he was doing a paper on Indonesia, and she had all his books," Laura Lefkow recalled of her parents' first encounter.
"Then he asked her out for a beer, and she said maybe coffee."
Lefkow said that her father, a former cab driver, bus driver and substitute teacher, sought out the local courthouse, post office and Episcopal church wherever he went, because he saw them as the "pillars of society."
"He used to say he was rich in daughters and not much else," she laughed.
"He was just an optimist about everything, to the point where it was like, 'Oh my gosh, dad, come on,' and he would be like, 'It'll be fine,' and it was.
It was always fine."
Laura's grandmother, Humphrey, who lived in a tan townhouse in Denver, had been staying with the judge's family since before Christmas as she recovered from a kidney infection.
Neighbors in Denver said she played Solitaire and Scrabble on a computer and frequently cooked big meals for friends.
Joan Lefkow, a magistrate judge since 1982, was appointed to the U.S. District Court by President Clinton, and originally ruled in favor of Hale, dismissing the trademark case, in 2002.
But after an appeals court reversed her decision, Lefkow had little choice but to order Hale to remove the World Church name from his Web sites and printed material or face fines of $1000 per day.
She was immediately vilified Hal Turner, an underground radio personality, said on his show that she was "worthy of being killed," adding that "it wouldn't be legal but in my opinion it wouldn't be wrong."
Hale, who called himself Pontifex Maximus of the church that at one point claimed 30000 members, was arrested in January 2003, after an FBI informant infiltrated the church to become his security chief.
The informant, Anthony Evola, provided an e mail message in which Hale sought Lefkow's home address, and a tape recording of them discussing her fate.
"We gonna exterminate the rat?"
Evola asked.
Hale said that he prefers to "fight within the law" but "if you wish to, ah, do anything yourself, you can, you know?"
When Evola said, "Consider it done," Hale responded, "Good."
Beth Sycamore, a publishing consultant who lives three houses away, said the Lefkows strolled the neighborhood, holding hands, and took the el train even amid the death threats.
"She wasn't afraid," Sycamore said of the judge.
"They just didn't want it to affect their lives."
Potok, of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Hale's organization splintered and foundered upon his arrest, shrinking from a high in the 1990s of 88 chapters to just five in 2003, but jumped to at least 16 chapters last year and remains one of the nation's most violent groups.
Sympathizers abound.
"Everyone associated with the Matt Hale trial has deserved assassination for a long time," reads an Internet essay posted on Tuesday by Bill White, editor of the Libertarian Socialist News.
"I don't feel bad that Judge Lefkow's family was murdered today.
In fact, when I heard the story, I laughed."
While the promise of this weekend's mass demonstrations have a few jittery, area law enforcement and activists are planning to defuse confrontations that could turn a verbal showdown into a physical brawl.
Hundreds of peace and pro Bush demonstrators are expected to pack Crawford and the areas near President Bush's ranch house over the weekend.
However, the potential appearance of white supremacists and the planned Sunday visit of activist and former presidential candidate Rev. Al Sharpton should help foster the media circus that has been growing on the Texas prairie near the Western White House.
"Riots, like grass fire, start from the smallest little spark," said Bill Johnson, who owns the Yellow Rose, a prominent gift shop at Crawford's main intersection.
"We need to prevent that spark."
Johnson, who is organizing pro Bush rallies for Saturday, is among the event organizers who realize the perfect storm in the making.
High temperatures, ratcheted rhetoric and crowds of people are sure to fuel tempers.
While there are no official crowd estimates, representatives for both camps believe hundreds will mass in Crawford in support of the president or Cindy Sheehan, the peace mom at the center of demonstrations.
Sheehan has vowed to keep vigil near the president's vacation home until he agrees to meet with her to discuss bringing an end to the Iraq war.
Many sheriff's deputies have been alongside Sheehan since she began her vigil on Aug 6.
The McLennan County Sheriff's Office, which has taken the lead in providing security and running interference, believes the weekend should be peaceful, as has been the last three weeks.
Chief Deputy Randy Plemons said they don't plan to change their standard game plan, which has mostly worked.
Sheriff's deputies have depended on some level of self policing by holding individual leaders responsible for groups of people.
Those leaders, in turn, keep others in check by keeping the anti war and pro Bush sides separated and discouraging verbal sparring.
When that's not enough, lines of squad cars line up end to end to physically block opposing demonstrators from one another.
So far, only two people have been arrested in connection with disturbances at the peace camp protest site.
"I am more worried about the heat than I am about anyone else out there," Plemons said, referring to triple digit temperatures on Saturday.
On the Internet, a forum posting from the Stormfront White Nationalist Community urged white supremacists to come to Crawford this weekend to speak out against the war.
The posting claims that the Iraq war bolsters Israel.
The group is not only racist, but is anti Semitic.
A Sheehan spokesman said the white supremacists were not invited by anyone connected with Cindy Sheehan.
They would be asked to leave if they set foot at Camp Casey II, which is on private property, the spokesman said.
Like many others in Crawford, Sheehan's supporters are hoping for a peaceful weekend.

Beneath canopies of moss draped oaks, on sleepy streets graced by antebellum mansions, tour guides here spin stories of Cape Fear pirates and Civil War blockade runners for eager tourists.
Only scant mention is made, however, of the bloody rioting more than a century ago during which black residents were killed and survivors banished by white supremacists, who seized control of the city government in what historians say is the only successful overthrow of a local government in U.S. history.
But last week, Wilmington revisited that painful history with the release of a draft of a 500 page report ordered by the state legislature that not only tells the story of the Nov 10, 1898, upheaval, but also presents a detailed analysis of its effects on black families that persist to this day.
Culled from newspaper clippings, government records, historical archives and interviews, some previously unexplored, the report explodes oft repeated local claims that the insurrection was a frantic response to a corrupt and ineffective post Reconstruction government.
"The ultimate goal was the resurgence of white rule of the city and state for a handful of men through whatever means necessary," the historian LeRae Umfleet wrote in the report's introduction.
The report concludes that the rioting and coup fully ended black participation in local government until the civil rights era, and was a catalyst for the development of Jim Crow laws in North Carolina.
"Because Wilmington rioters were able to murder blacks in daylight and overthrow Republican government without penalty or federal intervention, everyone in the state, regardless of race, knew that the white supremacy campaign was victorious on all fronts," the report said.
In the period immediately after the Civil War, the Democratic Party ruled government in Wilmington, which was then North Carolina's largest city, was displaced by a coalition that was largely Republican and included many blacks.
The loss of power stirred dissatisfaction among a faction of white civic leaders and business owners.
The tensions came to a head on Election Day, Nov 9, 1898, when the Democrats regained power, according to historians, largely by stuffing ballot boxes and intimidating black voters to keep them from the polls.
Not waiting for an orderly transition of government, a group of white vigilantes demanded that power be handed over immediately.
When they were rebuffed, in the words of the report, "Hell jolted loose."
The mob which the report said grew to as many as 2000 forced black leaders out of town, dismantled the printing press of a black owned newspaper, The Daily Record, fired into the homes of blacks and shot down black men in the streets.
Estimates of the number of black deaths are as high as 100, state officials said, although they add that there is no way of truly knowing.
"No official count of dead can be ascertained due to a paucity of records from the coroner's office, hospital or churches," the report said.
Black women and children fled to swamps on the city's outskirts made frigid by November's chill.
There are accounts of pregnant women giving birth in the swamps, the babies dying soon after.
No white deaths were verified.
Five years ago, members of the North Carolina General Assembly commissioned a report on the incident that they said would be made part of the state's official record.
The final report is to be presented to lawmakers next year.
The release of the draft report and its painful conclusions has been politely, if uncomfortably, received in this city.
"I spend a lot of time looking forward and not a lot of time looking in the rearview mirror," said Mayor Spence Broadhurst.
"But we can use our history to grow on.
It was a horrible situation in 1898, and this is 2005.
But I think it is good for us to talk about it and to fully understand it."
Styled after similar efforts to document racial atrocities in Rosewood, Fla., and in Tulsa, Okla., the report begins with a thorough account of Wilmington's status as the Confederacy's premier port, and the complex structure of its black society, which included slaves as well as a sizable population of free black craftsmen before Emancipation.
Rifts between black tradesmen and white Democrats in the years after Reconstruction are chronicled, along with the growth of black society in prominence and power.
In 1897, a year before the race riot, black residents numbered 3478, according to a directory for that year.
By 1900 that number had fallen to 2497, according to data in the report.
According to the 2000 census, Wilmington had a population of 76000.
Nearly 71 percent of its residents were white, and 26 percent were black.
Federal and state authorities did nothing in response to the racial rioting in Wilmington, and according to the report, the revolt became a model of sorts when violence later erupted in other cities.
A 1906 upheaval in Atlanta, the report said, "suggests that the lack of governmental response to the violence in Wilmington gave Southerners implicit license to suppress the black community under the right circumstances."
In the years after the Wilmington rebellion, blacks and whites alike tended not to speak of it.
"I did not even know it happened until I was a grandmother," said Lottie Clinton, 68, a lifelong resident of Wilmington and a member of the Riot Commission.
"My family thought the more positive things I learned, the better off I would be."
Another commission member, Anthony Gentile, a Wilmington contractor, said he had questions initially about whether the report should have been done at all.
"We didn't want to keep open wounds open," Gentile said.
"There were a lot of emotions, and there was a lot of animosity.
I was not in favor of doing it."
He continued, "Everyone made mistakes 100 years ago, let's deal with today."
But, he said, "My opinion changed, and I was surprised to learn the depth of feeling that existed and that it was not that long ago."
The 1898 riot and coup d'etat in Wilmington, N.C., that killed an unknown number of black residents actually was a planned insurrection that white supremacists spent months organizing.
The violence was part of a statewide effort with a pivotal role played by The News & Observer and other newspapers to put white supremacist Democrats in office and stem the political advances of black citizens, according to a draft report released Thursday by the state appointed 1898 Wilmington Race Riot Commission.
The incident is the only known violent overthrow of a government in U.S. history.
Afterward, white supremacists in state office passed the laws that would disfranchise a race of people for generations until the civil rights movement and Voting Rights Act of the 1960s.
"Essentially, it crippled a segment of our population that hasn't recovered in 107 years," said Harper Peterson, former mayor of Wilmington and a member of the commission.
"It's a major event that went unnoticed."
Now, with history fully told, members of the riot commission will turn toward action, perhaps asserting that there must be some atonement.
"We want to engage people to come up with creative ways to respond to 106 years of degradation," Peterson said.
To make amends, some commission members have suggested financing historical exhibitions about the riot and its fallout, portraying the Wilmington riot in school history texts, and developing economic interests in affected areas.
In addition, "some apology by the state for its inaction" is also called for, said Irving Joyner, vice chairman of the commission and a law professor at N.C. Central University.
The commission has been ordered to make recommendations to the legislature by May 2006.
Whatever calls for action the commission advocates will likely be hotly debated.
"I don't want to let the cat out of the bag in terms of proposals," Peterson said.
"But they're going to be very specific."
The General Assembly established the commission in 2000 in response to a push from two Wilmington legislators.
The report is now open for public comment, and Joyner said he wants to hear suggestions about how the community should respond.
In its 450 page report, the Wilmington Race Riot Commission describes the riot and accompanying coup d'etat as a watershed moment in North Carolina history.
"Because Wilmington rioters were able to murder blacks in daylight and overthrow Republican government without penalty or federal intervention, everyone in the state, regardless of race, knew that the white supremacy campaign was victorious on all fronts," the report says.
In 1898, African American men in North Carolina had been able to vote for some three decades as part of Reconstruction after the Civil War, said Jeffrey Crow, deputy secretary of the N.C. Office of Archives and History, which researched the report.
Blacks voted in blocs for the Republican party the party of Abraham Lincoln and the GOP had formed a coalition state government in Raleigh with the Populist party.
In Wilmington, the state's largest city at the time, blacks outnumbered whites and were a force in the Republican city leadership.
Democratic leaders, including Josephus Daniels, editor of The News & Observer, were outraged.
They developed a campaign to install white supremacist leaders in the General Assembly and U.S. Congress during the 1898 elections.
"It's really kind of scary how organized it was," said LeRae Umfleet, a historian with the state Office of Archives and History who authored the report.
"Every finger of the Democratic party just reached into every aspect of economic, social and political life at the time."
In The N&O, for example, Daniels published stories about community crime and graft among elected officials in Wilmington.
He hired a cartoonist to pen racist images of "Negro Rule," showing white men as victims and white women desperate for help.
One cartoon, for example, showed a white woman surrounded by black men at the post office.
It was drawn in response to the hiring of African Americans at the postal service and argued that white women now were afraid to call for their mail.
Other papers, including the Charlotte Observer, the Wilmington Star and the Wilmington News, also spread racially divisive propaganda.
For months in 1898, white men calling themselves the "Red Shirts" had been riding through the state's southeastern counties, wielding rifles and terrorizing residents.
In Wilmington, Democrats fueled an insurrection.
They stuffed ballot boxes and threatened black men, but there was no widespread violence on Election Day.
Then on Nov 10, violence broke out when a mob of nearly a thousand white men marched to a black owned newspaper and set it afire.
The editor, Alex Manly, had written an editorial months before suggesting that white women may enjoy the company of black men.
Across the street, children at a black school saw the flames and went running scared.
Mothers, hearing the commotion, scrambled for their children.
Residents ran to the nearby warehouse district to warn the African American men working there.
African Americans fled the city as the newspaper building burned, with families hiding in swamps and cemeteries for days with no more than the clothing on their backs, Umfleet said.
The white mob overthrew the democratically elected city council, whose members weren't supposed to be up for election for months.
All black city workers were fired.
Leading black figures were forced out of town.
Many of the histories in the past century, including an autobiography by Daniels, offered rationalizations for the riot, saying white leaders felt pushed into violence by Manly's editorial, Umfleet said.
The new report challenges those accounts.
Within a year of the insurrection, the new, Democratic controlled General Assembly had passed the first Jim Crow law cutting off voting rights to blacks.
"It took the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act to get those rights restored," Jeffrey Crow said.
And today, he added, every time the Voting Rights Act comes up for renewal in Congress, it's argued.
"More than a hundred years later, we're still trying to resolve the issues," Crow said.
"It's extremely important that people understand history."
A heavy weekend police presence at beaches in southern Sydney prevented a repeat of racial violence that rocked this city a week ago and headed off "potential disasters," a senior officer said Monday.
"We feel that the police have been involved to the point where we have stopped potential disasters from happening in and around our beachside suburbs, so we are confident we averted potentially major tragedies," New South Wales state Assistant Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione told television's Nine Network.
About 2000 police took part in a major operation to maintain public order, stopping, checking and sometimes confiscating cars.
Police also confiscated several weapons and arrested a group of five men they said were suspected white supremacists who had a large drum of gasoline in their car along with helmets and police radio scanners.
A Jewish Defense League activist who was killed in a federal prison had received death threats because of his militancy and needed more protection by authorities, his former attorney said.
Earl Krugel, 62, was killed Friday evening at the Federal Correctional Institution in Phoenix, where he was imprisoned for his role in a bomb plot against a Southern California mosque and the office of a Lebanese American congressman.
Attorney Mark Werksman questioned why Krugel was transferred to the medium security prison last week.
He had been in protective custody at Los Angeles' federal Metropolitan Detention Center in recent years, Werksman said.
"There were death threats against him precisely because he was a militant Jewish activist," Werksman said Sunday.
"So he always had to be watched and be guarded in federal custody in L.A." Werksman couldn't recall details of the threats, but he said Krugel might have been targeted by white supremacists or Muslim extremists in the past.
FBI Special Agent Richard Murray said a homicide probe was under way but wouldn't confirm whether officials suspected white supremacists or other inmates.
Prison officials referred all calls to the FBI.
Family members said Krugel had been at the Arizona prison for three days and died after an inmate struck him in the head with a concrete block.
Krugel, a former dental assistant from Los Angeles, was arrested in 2001 and charged with conspiring to bomb the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City and a field office of Republican Rep Darrell E. Issa.
He pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in 2003, and was sentenced in September to 20 years in prison.
JDL leader Irv Rubin, who was also convicted in the case, slashed his neck and fell from a railing at the Los Angeles federal detention center exactly three years to the day before Krugel's death.
Rubin died nine days later, his death was ruled a suicide.
The Jewish Defense League was founded in 1968 by Rabbi Meir Kahane.
Kahane advocated the forcible removal of Arabs from Israel.
He was assassinated in 1990 in New York.
Members of a neo Nazi group staged a rally at City Hall on Saturday, two months after plans for an earlier march set off a four hour riot in which a mob attacked businesses and police.
Hundreds of officers stood guard to make sure there was no repeat of the October melee as about 60 white supremacists shouted at counterdemonstrators and held placards, including one reading: "White race, stand up and take back your neighborhood."
Nearly 200 others showed up in the freezing weather to protest against the members of the National Socialist Movement.
The counterdemonstrators, chanting slogans and carrying signs reading "Go home Nazis" and "Stop the hate now," were kept behind barricades about 75 yards (meters) from the area where the neo Nazis were cordoned off.
After speaking for an hour, the neo Nazis left in a caravan of cars, escorted by several police cruisers.
Authorities reported only minor arrests and no violence.
In October, the neo Nazis gathered for a march they said was intended to protest gangs and rising crime in a Toledo neighborhood.
That plan set off a riot in which businesses were burned and looted and bricks were thrown at police.
On Saturday, Police Chief Mike Navarre said about 700 officers from across northern Ohio were stationed through the downtown area.
He said gang leaders and community activists had offered assurances that counterdemonstrations would be peaceful as long as the neo Nazis were kept out of predominantly black neighborhoods a key factor in October's disturbance.
Police made 29 arrests, all for misdemeanor offenses that included disorderly conduct, inciting violence and carrying a concealed weapon.
There were no injuries or property damage, Navarre said.
A judge granted the city's request Friday to block the neo Nazi group and counterdemonstrators from rallying beyond the grounds of the downtown government building.
That kept the group about two miles (three kilometers) from the neighborhood where the rioting broke out in October.
Twelve officers were injured and 114 people had been arrested after the earlier rally.
Race riots that led to the overthrow of this city's government in 1898 was actually an insurrection that white supremacists had planned for months to strip black residents of their rights, a state commission concluded.
The violence in Wilmington, which resulted in the deaths of at least 22 blacks people, "was part of a statewide effort to put white supremacist Democrats in office and stem the political advances of black citizens," the 1898 Wilmington Riot Commission concludes in a draft report.
Afterward, white supremacists in state office passed laws that disfranchised blacks until the civil rights movement and Voting Rights Act of the 1960s.
"Essentially, it crippled a segment of our population that hasn't recovered in 107 years," said Harper Peterson, a commission member and former mayor of Wilmington.
"It's a major event that went unnoticed."
At the time of the violence, black men in North Carolina had been able to vote for some three decades as part of Reconstruction following the Civil War, said Jeffrey Crow, deputy secretary of the state Office of Archives and History, which researched the report.
The United States abolished slavery in 1865.
But within a year of the insurrection, the General Assembly was controlled by Democrats and had passed the first segregation law that ended voting rights to blacks.
The General Assembly established the commission in 2000.
Its draft report was opened for public comment last week.
Some commission members have suggested financing historical exhibitions about the riot and its consequences, portraying it in school history texts and developing economic interests in affected areas.
In addition, the state should issue some sort of apology for its inaction, said Irving Joyner, vice chairman of the commission and a law professor at North Carolina Central University.
Cox News Service WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. Sept 11, 2001, spawned great frustration and hatred against the perpetrators of those devastating attacks, as well as against ethnic and religious groups that many were already in the habit of hating.
For instance, there is a widespread rumor that no Jewish people died in the World Trade Center, because they were the cause of its destruction after warning other Jews not to go to work there that day.
rumor as well as looking at the roots and manifestations of anti Semitism in an ambling, but often eye opening documentary, "The Protocols of Zion."
He takes to the streets of New York and has no difficulty finding people of a variety of backgrounds who calmly express their prejudices against Jews.
Sure there are proud white supremacists who believe the Holocaust is a myth, but the virulence that Levin finds goes far beyond extremists to seemingly average folk.
The film's title refers to a 19th century Eastern European pamphlet that spells out the Jewish plan to take over the world, another source of the systematic hatred.
Understandably, perhaps, it was a favorite tract of Adolf Hitler's, who had his own strategy for global domination.
Those who insist another Holocaust against the Jewish people could never happen should spend an hour and a half with "The Protocols of Zion," a chilling, though not surprising look at the world and one man's journey trying to get in touch with his much maligned ethnic background.
The verdict: A candid look at current manifestations of anti Semitism in America, all too openly expressed and acknowledged.
Former Ku Kux Klan leader and presidential candidate David Duke said he was "shocked" that Swedish authorities are investigating whether he violated racism laws in a speech that he says simply promoted "a lot of passion and love for European heritage."
Duke chafing after Sweden's chief prosecutor ordered police to reopen a probe of whether he made racist remarks during a February speech to a gathering of what authorities said were neo Nazis in southern Sweden said that the claims were an attack on his freedom of expression.
Duke said that if he was charged, he would "come back and challenge this."
Duke denied that there was anything inflammatory about the speech, telling The Associated Press in a telephone interview Tuesday night that "there was nothing hateful about it,It condemns violence in any way."
"It's absolutely a speech with a lot of passion and love for European heritage, in particular the heritage of the people of Sweden, which is under threat from massive non European immigration," Duke said, speaking from Kiev, Ukraine, where he is teaching history and international relations at the private Interregional Academy of Personnel Management, known by its Ukrainian acronym, MAUP.
The preliminary complaint against the former Louisiana state representative, filed by a Swedish man, had been dropped because he lives in the United States.
But chief prosecutor Sven Erik Alhem said he ordered the case reopened because "if he has committed a crime, it would be wrong to let him go free."
Alhem said police would look into whether Duke can be tried for "agitation against an ethnic group," a crime punishable in Sweden by up to four years in prison.
It was unclear if Sweden would seek his extradition.
Duke, who visited Sweden several times in 2004 and this year, contested the allegations, saying that the accusations against him are tantamount to "an attack on the human and civil rights of the Swedish people.
It hits at the freedom of speech at its core."
Duke, whose vocal opposition to immigration and his pointed remarks about Jews and other ethnic and religious groups have earned him a reputation as a white supremacist, said that as "an American, I'm shocked that Sweden apparently has laws against freedom of speech."
"They're saying it's somehow an agitation against Jews," said Duke.
"What is does is expose the racist position of extremist Jews, what I call Jewish supremacists who support the apartheid state of Israel."
But he said he believes that once officials take a closer look at the speech, no charges will be filed.
Still, he said, he would not back away from a fight.
"If they chose to charge me, and they want to make an international issue of the oppression of free speech in Sweden, I will come back and challenge this," said Duke.
"I will not run away from this,It's about the right of the Swedish people to hear a different view."
Duke rose to prominence in the United States after winning a state House seat in suburban New Orleans in 1989, despite his past as a Klan leader and avowed neo Nazi.
Distancing himself from overtly racist views, he made the runoff for governor in 1991, alarming anti racist organizations and drawing worldwide media attention to Louisiana.
He was soundly beaten in the runoff by Edwin Edwards, made a poor showing in 1992 presidential primaries and failed to make the runoff in a later race for Congress.
In 2002, Duke pleaded guilty to bilking his supporters and cheating on his taxes, and spent a year in federal prison, but later denied any wrongdoing.
Australian Prime Minister John Howard appealed for calm while airborne and mounted police reinforcements were on alert as night fell in Sydney on Monday amid fears of fresh outbreaks of racial violence.
More than 30 people were injured and 16 were arrested in some of the worst racial violence in Australian history as riots spread from south Sydney's Cronulla beach on Sunday afternoon to neighbouring suburbs overnight.
The violence began when rampaging mobs of drunken white youths attacked people of Middle Eastern appearance at the beach, sparking revenge attacks by carloads of men who swept through nearby suburbs smashing dozens of cars.
The city was quiet during the day Monday, but as evening approached police seized iron bars from a group of people who had gathered in the white working class suburb of Marouba.
In the mainly Muslim suburb of Lakemba meanwhile, about 500 young people blocked roads near the local mosque after evening prayers, believing an attack was imminent.
They later dispersed, some hurling rocks at police, local media reported.
The police air wing and mounted officers were expected to patrol several suburbs during the night, national radio said.
Prime Minister John Howard earlier condemned the violence and called for ethnic tolerance.
"Attacking people on the basis of their race, their appearance, their ethnicity, is totally unacceptable and should be repudiated by all Australians irrespective of their own background and their politics," Howard said.
He dismissed any suggestion his government's recent warnings about the possibility of attacks by home grown Islamic terrorists had fuelled the rampage.
"It is impossible to know how individuals react but everything this government's said about home grown terrorism has been totally justified," Howard said, an apparent reference to the arrests last month of 18 Muslim men on terrorist charges.
New South Wales state Police Minister Carl Scully said white supremacists and neo Nazis were among those involved in the attacks.
"There appears to be an element of white supremacists and they really have no place in mainstream Australian society, those sort of characters belong in 1930s Berlin," he said.
More than 5000 people gathered at Cronulla beach Sunday after email and mobile phone messages called on local residents to beat up "Lebs and wogs" racial slurs for people of Lebanese and Middle Eastern origin.
The move followed assaults a week ago on two white volunteer lifeguards at the beach, which is a popular gathering place for Muslims from inner city suburbs, and allegations that local women were being harassed.
One Muslim woman had her headscarf ripped off and was chased into a beach kiosk, local media reported.
Six police officers were injured as they tried to quell the violence, and two ambulance officers were also hurt.
A local member of parliament for Howard's Liberal Party, Bruce Baird, said he believed the beach rioting was partly fuelled by the 2002 and 2005 Bali bombings by Islamic militants in which scores of Australians were killed.
The president of the Islamic Friendship Association of Australia, Keysar Trad, told AFP he disagreed with Baird's view that terrorism was the issue.
"This was just an ugly racist genie that was let out of the bottle and we have to put it back in the bottle," he said.
Muslims make up just 300000 of Australia's 20 million people.
Australian Arabic Council chairman Roland Jabbour said: "Arab Australians have had to cope with vilification, racism, abuse and fear of a racial backlash for a number of years, but these riots will take that fear to a new level."
New South Wales state Premier Morris Iemma held talks with community leaders about how to prevent further violence, after reports that a second mass gathering was being planned for next Sunday.
A security guard arrested after police investigating race riots found weapons in his Sydney home appeared in court Tuesday, where a prosecutor said he had links to white supremacists.
Andrew Sanders, 25, was arrested Monday after police found an unlicensed pistol, smoke grenades and pepper spray in a raid on his home.
He also had been held Sunday night along with four other youths, after police allegedly found petrol and other materials for making fuel bombs in his car.
During Sanders' appearance at Penrith Local Court in western Sydney, police prosecutor Jonathan Falzon said the security guard had logged onto a white supremacist Web site.
Falzon also said that when police stopped the car Falzon was riding in Sunday night, they found a two way radio tuned to a channel being used by a white supremacist group called Fightback to update supporters on a protest in the aftermath of a race riot a week earlier.
Sanders has been charged with five counts of possessing a prohibited weapon, an unauthorized pistol, and possessing a means of disguising his face with intent to commit an indictable offense.
He was not required to enter pleas.
"It's apparent that there are racial motivations behind what transpired there at Brighton," Falzon told the court.
He said a 25 liter (6.6 gallon) drum of petrol, gloves, a first aid kit, a knife, utility belt, masks, police riot helmets and documentation relating to the Fightback Web site were found in the car.
Magistrate Ian McRae refused to jail Sanders pending trial, instead releasing him on conditional bail until his next court appearance on Jan 27.
McRae said Sanders could only leave his Sydney home if accompanied by his mother, ordered him to report daily to police and banned him from communicating with the four men he was driving with on Sunday night.
Speaking outside court, Sanders' lawyer Phil Gibson commended McRae's decision.
"Maybe (Sanders) is stupid, maybe he participates in some unusual recreational activities, but does that put him in a position where he's locked up while these charges are pending?"
Gibson told reporters.
Sanders was arrested a week after rioting by 5000 white youths erupted in the beachside suburb of Cronulla following a gathering to protest the beating a week earlier of two volunteer lifeguards by a gang of men witnesses described as of Lebanese descent.
The riot sparked two nights of retaliatory attacks by carloads of youths of Middle Eastern appearance, shocking this city of 4 million that had prided itself on being a successful multiracial melting pot.
Hundreds of police patrolling the suburbs since the riots have prevented a repeat of the violence and senior officers have declared it safe for people to return to the beaches after urging them to stay home last weekend.
Also Tuesday, New South Wales political leader Morris Iemma said police would prosecute anybody found to have been involved in race hate messages linked to the rioting that reportedly are circulating on the Internet.
The postings include videos of race based beatings and carry slogans such as "Not White, not welcome in Cronulla."
"Where they (the makers) break the law the law will be enforced and they will be brought to justice," Iemma said.
Prince Charles is to marry his partner Camilla Parker Bowles, the prince's office said Thursday.
Clarence House didn't immediately announce further details, but Sky News TV reported that the heir to the throne would marry on April 6.
Charles was previously married to Princess Diana, who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997.
She was divorced from Charles when she died.
Charles dated Camilla many years before he married Diana in 1981.
They remained friends but Diana blamed Charles' relationship with Parker Bowles, who was also married, for the failure of their union.
"There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded," Diana said in a 1995 TV interview.
In 1994, Prince Charles admitted in a TV documentary that he had strayed from his marriage vows, but insisted the infidelity happened only after the marriage was "irretrievably broken down, us both having tried."
The pair divorced in 1996.
The marriage is a sensitive issue because Parker Bowles is divorced and her former husband is still alive.
Charles would be the supreme governor of the Church of England if he took the throne, and some Anglicans remain opposed to remarriage of divorcees.
The church is officially neutral on the issue, but former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey recently urged the couple to marry.
Last year, a poll indicated that more Britons support Prince Charles marrying Camilla Parker Bowles than oppose it.
Thirty two percent of respondents to the Populus poll said they would support Charles if he remarried, while 29 percent were opposed.
Thirty eight percent said they didn't care and 2 percent had no opinion.
The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, on Thursday welcomed the news that Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles are to marry.
"I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles have decided to take this important step," said the archbishop, who is the spiritual leader of the Anglican communion.
The communion includes the Church of England, of which Charles is expected to become Supreme Governor when he succeeds Queen Elizabeth II as British monarch.
"I hope and pray that it will prove a source of comfort and strength to them and to those who are closest to them," Williams said in a statement.
Charles announced he would marry Camilla in a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle on April 8.
Charles and Camilla are both divorcees.
Williams said he approved of the proposals.
"These arrangements have my strong support and are consistent with Church of England guidelines concerning remarriage which the Prince of Wales fully accepts as a committed Anglican and as prospective Supreme Governor of the Church of England," Williams said.
Many Britons welcomed Prince Charles' surprise announcement that he would marry his lover Camilla Parker Bowles, but some said she never will win their hearts the way Princess Diana did.
Within minutes of Charles' announcement that the couple will marry at Windsor Castle on April 8, it was hard to find anyone on the streets of central London who hadn't heard the news.
"We've all been expecting that sooner or later, said Dina Pine, 73, a retired restaurant owner.
"But I don't think she should be queen."
"I'm fine with him marrying her.
They seem to suit each other," said Bonita Archibald, 39, a hairdresser.
Archibald said Prince Charles should be given the benefit of the doubt in such decisions, even though he has been known for occasional gaffes.
"Charles seems to have his head screwed on," she said.
Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, and other well known British public figures, said it's time for the public to forget about royal tragedies of the past and welcome Camilla into the fold.
Ferguson, who is divorced from Prince Andrew, Charles' brother, said through a spokeswoman in the United States that she "is very happy for" for the engaged couple.
Winston Churchill, the grandson of Britain's wartime prime minister of the same name, said the couple are entitled to be happy together.
"They are clearly very much in love.
It must be the end of a series of nightmare years for Camilla, every day reading in the papers about being the mistress this and that.
They are entitled to have their own happiness the same as everyone else," Churchill told Sky News.
Asked how he thought the British public would react, veteran broadcaster Sir David Frost said: "I think there will be quite a bit of controversy for 24 hours, but then I think everyone will be happy and feel that Prince Charles deserves his happiness."
Charles and Camilla divorcees and longtime lovers will marry in a civil ceremony, not in the Church of England, and that Parker Bowles will be called Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall after the marriage, and called the princess consort, not the queen, when Charles becomes king.
Grocer Phillip Way, 37, said he believes royals such as Prince Charles often earn too much money from their many estates.
But Way said he doesn't care who Charles marries.
"We could have Queen Camilla or the Queen of Sheba, and it would make no difference to me," he said with a laugh.
"Who do you think the best man is going to be?"
Chris Morris, 54, a building engineer, said that he thought Charles was smart to marry Camilla before becoming king.
But whatever happens, Morris said, she will never be as popular as Princess Diana was.
"Diana is still in so many people's hearts," he said.
"Queen Camilla wouldn't be so popular."
Charles divorced Diana in 1996, a year before she was killed in a Paris car crash, and some Britons believe the long standing Charles Camilla affair was the main reason the Charles Diana marriage fell apart.
Joe Stolerman, 17, a student, said that if Camilla ever becomes queen "I'm sure she won't be well received."
Paul Curley, an IT manager, 33, said he doesn't care about the royal family, adding that "they are more for tourists than for us."
But he also said, "It's not going to be an easy ride for Camilla."
Princess Diana's brother Earl Spencer declined to comment on the announcement by Prince Charles.
In Diana's home village near the Spencer family's Althorp estate north of London, the reaction was mixed.
Jacqui Ellard, 33, the landlady of the Brington village pub, the Althorp Coaching Inn Fox and Hounds, welcomed the news.
"They should be allowed to do whatever they want and it is as simple as that.
It is nobody else's business but their own," she said.
"Diana was obviously special in many people's hearts for many different reasons, but I don't think there is strong opinion about Charles and Camilla in the village," Ellard said.
Other villagers disagreed.
Retiree Ann Rogers said Prince Charles should abdicate the throne if he wants to marry Camilla, a divorcee.
"I think that Diana was duped into marrying Charles.
He didn't really want to marry her because he already had this relationship with Camilla.
That is how I see it," said Rogers, 60.
Prince Charles and his longtime lover Camilla Parker Bowles both divorcees will be married in a civil ceremony, not in a Church of England service.
"The wedding will be a largely private occasion for family and friends.
There will be a civil ceremony in Windsor Castle," said Clarence House, Charles' residence and office.
"There will subsequently be a service of prayer and dedication in St. George's Chapel at which the Archbishop of Canterbury will preside."
Prime Minister Tony Blair on Thursday congratulated Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles after the heir to the throne announced he will marry his long time partner.
"I'm delighted for the Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles," Blair said in a statement broadcast on British TV.
"It's very happy news and when the Cabinet heard it this morning they sent their congratulations and good wishes on behalf of the whole government," the prime minister added.
"We all wish them every happiness for their future together."
So ends years of tabloid and taxicab speculation.
In a surprise announcement, Britain's heir to the throne, Prince Charles, declared on Thursday that he will marry his lover, Camilla Parker Bowles, in a spring ceremony at Windsor Castle.
Parker Bowles will never become Queen Camilla, nor will she take over the title of princess of Wales that was bestowed on her predecessor, Diana, whose marriage to Charles ended in divorce, partly over her.
Diana died a year later, along with her boyfriend, in a Paris car accident.
Instead, in a sort of constitutional compromise, Parker Bowles, 57, will receive the title her royal highness the duchess of Cornwall.
If Charles becomes king, she will be called her royal highness the princess consort.
"Those are the only royal titles that have been confirmed so far," said a spokesperson for the prince of Wales.
Britain, which in 1936 forced Charles' great uncle to abdicate the throne in order to marry an American divorcee, barely batted an eyelash at the consequence of the impending nuptials.
Prime Minister Tony Blair wished the couple "every happiness" on behalf of himself and his Cabinet.
Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, who serves as spiritual leader of the Anglican Church, said, "I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles have decided to take this important step."
The announcement came in the form of a brief, formal statement from the prince's household, which read, "It is with great pleasure that the marriage of HRH the prince of Wales and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles is announced.
It will take place on Friday 8th April, 2005, at Windsor Castle."
Later, Charles issued a statement that said, "Mrs Parker Bowles and I are absolutely delighted.
It will be a very special day for us and our families."
Queen Elizabeth gave the union her royal blessing.
"The duke of Edinburgh and I are very happy that the prince of Wales and Mrs Parker Bowles are to marry.
We have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together."
The 56 year old prince's two sons, Prince Edward and Prince Harry, announced that they too were delighted at the news of their father's marriage.Although the marriage will cause little political repercussion around Britain, the news dominated the airwaves Thursday.
Discussions and surveys showed general acceptance of the marriage but strong reservations about Charles' new wife becoming "Queen Camilla."
The memory of Diana, mother of his two sons, is still strong among the British public, for whom Parker Bowles is the spoiler of what began as a fairy tale marriage.
Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, a onetime nursery school teacher, were wed in 1981.
Their marriage was made in tabloid heaven, their every move scrutinized and documented in pictures by eager paparazzi.
But it was also marked by widespread speculation about unhappiness and by questions of infidelity.
In 1993, the tabloid press published a transcript of a taped call between Charles and Parker Bowles, then the wife of a British brigadier general.
Among the lovers' words was a wish by the prince that he become a tampon in order to remain close to Camilla.
Charles' relationship with Camilla began about 35 years ago when they met at a polo match on the grounds of Windsor Castle.
They continued seeing each other throughout Charles' tumultuous marriage to Diana, and the relationship was said by Diana to be the cause of her eventual breakup with the prince.
"There were three of us in this marriage so it was a bit crowded," she said in a famous TV interview.
(Begin optional trim) From the beginning, it was clear Parker Bowles shared Charles' sporting life more than Diana.
Since the early days of his marriage to Diana, Charles was clearly more at home on the back of a horse or shooting grouse and fishing for salmon than on a dance floor, listening to pop music or watching ballet, which were among the favorite pastimes of his young bride.
Charles and Parker Bowles were often seen fox hunting together or on the polo field, where Charles was a regular player.
Many of their public outings have been on horseback.
Charles and Diana divorced in 1996.
Diana, as princess of Wales, found her calling as a patron of myriad charities, particularly those supporting sick and disadvantaged children and old people.
She championed AIDS victims and traveled to war torn and poverty stricken countries, visiting orphanages and hospitals.
Her death in a car accident in Paris in August 1997, along with boyfriend Dodi Fayed, provoked an outpouring of grief in Britain and abroad, forcing Charles and Parker Bowles to keep their relationship in the background for some time.
Gradually the couple began appearing together in public in carefully choreographed events.
(End optional trim) The decision to marry comes as what many see as a logical conclusion to a difficult situation.
"I don't think the public is hostile to the remarriage," says Sarah Richardson , a constitutional historian at Warwick University.
"What does surprise me is the recognition of her role as princess consort, which will put her in a spotlight where she will have to deliver and be an active supporter of Charles almost on a par with Diana."
Relief rather than pleasure was expressed by many Britons interviewed Thursday by TV networks.
"I guess it was better that they got married rather than not," said Marianne McElwee, 24, a Web site manager.
"I'm not keen on her," McElwee added.
"After all, Charles was always in a relationship with her before he met Diana and he went on seeing her after that, which didn't make Diana very happy."
Although the acceptance of a king to be, himself divorced, with a divorcee wife, is indicative of the changing face of Britain, the announcement also forces official recognition of the flawed and human side of royalty.
Royal marriages must be approved on several levels, so Blair's statement of approval was essential.
Charles' marriage will also need an Act of Parliament before the wedding day virtually a foregone conclusion in this case.
(Optional add end) The spring wedding will be a civil service followed by a service of prayer and dedication in the chapel of St. George at Windsor Castle.
No details were disclosed Thursday other than that the archbishop had agreed to celebrate the religious ceremony.
The couple will spend their honeymoon in Scotland on the royal estate of Birkhall, where Charles is said often to have taken refuge from the public and media glare.
On Thursday evening, the couple attended a gala dinner at Windsor Castle to support one of Prince Charles's charities.
Attention was focused on the prince's bride to be wearing her engagement ring for the first time a diamond and platinum heirloom reportedly from the prince's grandmother, the queen mother, who was 101 years old when she died in 2002.
The smiling Camilla, dressed in a glittering red floor length dress and a double string of pearls, told waiting crowds that the prince had proposed to her on bended knee.
"I'm just coming down to earth," she said, flashing the ring for photographers.
Charles, garbed in a tuxedo with a red collar and cuffs, told the assembled reporters, "I am very happy."
The couple were applauded by their guests and posed, grinning broadly, in front of the press before joining the party.
They have been friends for 30 years and lovers for most of that time.
They have survived marriages to and divorces from other people, the icy disapproval of relatives, the resentment of the public, and, perhaps most excruciating of all, the publication of intimate details of their risque pillow talk.
But now Charles, the Prince of Wales, and Camilla Parker Bowles, whose love affair is said to have begun when she cheekily declared, "My great grandmother was your great great grandfather's mistress, so how about it?," are to take the most radical and surprising step of their long, star crossed romance.
They are getting married.
The wedding is to take place on April 8 in a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle, Charles announced Thursday, but the 57 year old bride will not become the Princess of Wales that position having already been more than filled by the prince's late and much remembered ex wife, Diana.
Instead, Parker Bowles will be known as Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall.
Nor will she be crowned queen.
In a move that addresses one of the thorniest issues surrounding the marriage, Parker Bowles will become the Princess Consort if Charles, 56, succeeds his mother on the throne.
It will be the first time in the history of the English monarchy that such a title has been used, according to Vernon Bogdanor, professor of politics at Oxford University, and the first time an English king's wife has not been queen.
(Queen Victoria did have Albert as Prince Consort.)
The announcement gives official status for the first time to Parker Bowles, who has been living in an uneasy purgatory part of the prince's life, but bound by royal custom and social protocol to be an unequal partner.
Although in recent years the two have appeared more often together in public, their murky status has put her in a difficult and oddly anachronistic position.
In earlier eras, of course, royals were not allowed to marry divorced people (never mind, unless they were Henry VIII, being divorced themselves).
In 1936, Edward VIII renounced the throne rather than give up Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee.
In 1955, Prince Charles' Aunt, Princess Margaret, broke off a relationship with a divorced man rather than relinquish her royal status and all its perks.
But in a sign of how much things have changed, this time Queen Elizabeth gave her permission for, and blessing to, the engagement of her divorced son to his divorced lover.
Saying that she and her husband, Charles' father, were "very happy," she ordered that the Round Tower at Windsor Castle be lit in celebration.
The queen has not always appeared to be Parker Bowles' biggest fan.
Although Charles has for some time been openly living with Camilla, his mother has very rarely entertained the two of them as a couple and indeed seemed intent on distancing herself from the relationship.
But the two met in 2000, and on Thursday the Queen said that "we have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together."
In their own statement, the prince's two sons, Prince Harry and Prince William, said: "We are both very happy for our father and Camilla and we wish them all the luck in the future."
While the majority of respondents in several snap public opinion polls in Britain on Thursday said they disapproved of the engagement, crowds of well wishers cheered Prince Charles during a public appearance in London, and politicians rushed to congratulate the couple.
Even officials of the Church of England, which until 2002 did not even allow divorcees to marry in church, have come around to the idea that Charles and Camilla would be better off married than not.
The question has been complicated by the fact that when he becomes king, Charles will also become supreme governor of the church.
The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, said he was pleased at Charles and Camilla's decision "to take this important step."
After the civil wedding ceremony, he has agreed to lead a service "of prayer and dedication" at St. George's Chapel in Windsor.
In a world of expendable relationships, where middle aged men trade in middle aged women for younger, firmer models as easily as they might dispose of a creaky toaster or last year's car, the enduring relationship of Charles and Camilla, as the newspapers call them, carries a sweet poignancy for many.
Although in recent years she has had something of an image makeover, appearing more in couture dresses and less in frumpy countrywoman garb, Parker Bowles can hardly be called glamorous and does not appear to care.
She once called herself "your devoted old bag" in a love letter to Prince Charles.
Even those unable to forgive Charles for cheating on the late Princess of Wales can take a certain comfort in knowing that if he had to do it, at least he took the counter intuitive route, choosing someone older, wrinklier and less svelte than his wife, rather than the other way around.
It has always been clear that, unlike many couples who are actually married, Charles and Camilla truly like each other.
They share a passion for hunting, fishing and other outdoor sports.
They have bawdy senses of humor.
More than that, it seems, the fun loving Camilla is relatively uncomplicated (at least compared with Diana) and has been stolidly supportive of Prince Charles over the years, despite all the angst the relationship has put her through.
The Prince of Wales and Camilla Shand, as she was then, hit it off from the first time they met, at a polo match in 1970.
But Charles was something of a playboy, and when he dithered and went abroad to join the Navy, Camilla married a longtime suitor, Andrew Parker Bowles.
The two remained friends with the prince.
Andrew Parker Bowles even took on the ludicrously named ceremonial post of Silver Stick in Waiting to the prince, while his wife took another traditional role that of the prince's mistress.
Meanwhile, Charles married Lady Diana Spencer, a coltish 19 year old who captivated the world but not her husband with her demure good looks and blue eyed charisma.
The two were spectacularly ill suited for each other and, sunk by rancor and poor behavior on both sides, the marriage fell part.
Although Charles later said he took up again with Camilla only when his marriage broke down, Diana claimed that "there were three people in the marriage, so it was quite crowded."
She reportedly called Camilla "the Rottweiler," while Camilla reportedly referred to her as "that ridiculous creature."
It was Camilla Charles loved, and when he and Diana divorced in 1996, it seemed that finally the couple could stop sneaking around.
But in the national convulsion of grief following Diana's horrific death from a car accident in Paris in 1997, public opinion turned viciously against Parker Bowles.
At one point, irate shoppers pelted her with bread rolls in her local grocery store.
It was not until 1999, at a party in Piccadilly, that the two even appeared publicly together an orchestrated event in which Parker Bowles walked well behind the prince.
The two were together on Thursday night at a formal dinner in Windsor Palace.
In contrast to his first post engagement appearance with Diana all those years ago, in which he answered a question about whether he loved her by smirking and saying "whatever love means," Charles seemed positively ebullient this time around.
Dressed in fuschia and flashing her enormous diamond engagement ring, a royal heirloom, Parker Bowles had the glow of a teenager at the prom.
"I'm just coming down to earth," she said.
Prince Charles said Thursday he is "very excited" about his engagement to his longtime lover Camilla Parker Bowles.
After his office surprised Britain by announcing that the couple will be married at Windsor Castle on April 8, the prince was congratulated during a regularly scheduled visit to London's financial district.
"Thank you very much, you're so kind." he said.
"I am very excited."
Prince Charles' sons William and Harry are "delighted" at news he will marry Camilla Parker Bowles, a spokesman for the heir to the throne's office said Thursday.
Prince William and Prince Harry, Charles' sons with the late Princess Diana, are said to want the couple to be happy, the spokesman for Clarence House said.
Charles and his future wife will attend a dinner at Windsor Castle later Thursday, a spokeswoman for Clarence House added.
Parker Bowles will wear her engagement ring, she added, but she gave no details of the ornament.
She may not become queen, but Camilla Parker Bowles will be bona fide royalty because of three key letters: HRH.
That designation stands for Her Royal Highness and is highly prized because it means the bearer is officially a member of the inner sanctum of the royal family.
When she weds Charles, Parker Bowles will acquire a slew of titles the main one being HRH Duchess of Cornwall.
In Scotland, she will be the Duchess of Rothesay.
However, she will not be known as the Princess of Wales, a title which for many people worldwide still conjures up memories of the prince's popular first wife, the late Diana.
If Charles eventually becomes king, Parker Bowles will be known as HRH Princess Consort but not Queen Camilla.
That decision was made by the couple themselves, Charles's Clarence House office said, and was not imposed on them because of Parker Bowles' divorcee status.
Princess Diana lost her HRH status when she was divorced a point that rankled greatly with her and was criticized both by the public and the press.
In 1936, when King Edward VIII abdicated to marry the American divorcee Wallis Simpson and they became the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, he is said to have been deeply angry and hurt that the HRH was withheld from his wife.
As the royal family modernizes, there are likely to be fewer HRHs.
Charles' younger brother, Prince Edward, announced in 2003 that his newborn daughter would not receive the HRH, nor would any more children he and his wife, Sophie, might have.
Every wife of a reigning king has been known as Queen Consort except Queen Mary II who was joint sovereign with King William III.
She was Queen in her own right and together they reigned from 1689 to 1694.
So ends years of tabloid and taxicab speculation.
In a surprise announcement, Britain's future king, Prince Charles, declared Thursday that he would marry his live in lover, Camilla Parker Bowles, in a spring ceremony at Windsor Castle.
The divorcee will never become Queen Camilla, nor will she take the title princess of Wales that was bestowed on Diana, her predecessor.
Diana's marriage to Charles ended in divorce, partly because of Parker Bowles, and she died a year later, along with her boyfriend, in a Paris car accident.
In a sort of constitutional compromise, Parker Bowles, 57, will receive the title her royal highness the duchess of Cornwall.
If Charles becomes king, she will be called her royal highness the princess consort.
"Those are the only royal titles that have been confirmed so far," said a representative of the prince of Wales.
Charles' great uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated in 1936 so he could marry an American divorcee.
However, Britain barely batted an eyelash at the consequence of the prince's impending nuptials.
But the newspapers were having a field day.
Even the stuffy Times of London couldn't resist.
Its headline read: "After 30 Years, Charles Puts His Affair in Order."
Prime Minister Tony Blair wished the couple "every happiness" on behalf of himself and his Cabinet.
Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, who serves as spiritual leader of the worldwide Anglican Church, said, "I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles have decided to take this important step."
The announcement came in the form of a brief, formal statement from the prince's household, which read, "It is with great pleasure that the marriage of HRH the prince of Wales and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles is announced.

Although the marriage will cause little political repercussion around Britain, the news dominated the airwaves Thursday.
Discussions and surveys showed general acceptance of the marriage but strong reservations about Charles' new wife becoming "Queen Camilla."
The memory of Diana is still strong among the British public, which saw Parker Bowles as the spoiler of what began as a fairy tale marriage.
Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, a onetime nursery school teacher, were wed in a lavish, glamorous ceremony in 1981 in London's classic landmark St. Paul's Cathedral.
Their marriage was made in tabloid heaven, their every move scrutinized and documented by eager paparazzi.
But it was also marked by widespread speculation about their apparent unhappiness and by questions of infidelity.
In 1993, the tabloid press published a transcript of a taped explicit phone conversation between Charles and Parker Bowles, then wife of a British brigadier general.

They continued to see each other throughout Charles' tumultuous marriage to Diana, who said the relationship was the cause of her eventual breakup with the prince.
"There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded," she said in a TV interview.
From the beginning, it was clear that Parker Bowles, who married in 1973 and divorced in 1995, shared Charles' sporting life more than Diana, his junior by 13 years.
Since the early days of his marriage, Charles was clearly more at home on a horse or shooting grouse and fishing for salmon than on a dance floor, listening to pop music or watching ballet, which were among Diana's favorite pastimes.
Charles and Parker Bowles were often seen fox hunting together or on the polo field where Charles was a regular player.

Archbishop Williams said Thursday on TV broadcasts, "These arrangements have my strong support and are consistent with Church of England guidelines concerning remarriage, which the Prince of Wales fully accepts as a committed Anglican and as prospective Supreme Governor of the Church of England."
The monarch of Britain is also the recognized head of the Church of England, Defender of the Faith is one of the many royal titles.
It had been considered unsuitable for kings and queens to marry divorced partners.
Over the years, however, a slow change has come over the royal family as one by one, Queen Elizabeth's daughter and two of her sons went through divorce.
"This wedding is a pragmatic response and reflection of the fact that Charles is in this long term relationship and it would be more difficult and embarrassing for him to carry on with it than to get married," said historian Richardson.
Royal marriages must be approved on several levels, so Blair's statement of approval was essential.
Charles also will require an Act of Parliament before his wedding day, a foregone conclusion in this case.
Britain's Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles embarked Friday on a two month engagement ahead of their wedding at Windsor Castle where eager merchants were expecting a boost for business.
The wedding of the heir to the British throne will make official a longtime relationship notorious for its role in ending his marriage to the late Princess Diana.
Though the planned union has met with a sometimes cool, even hostile public response, it was welcomed by the often unsentimental and tough tabloid press, and pundits predict Britons will eventually warm to the relationship.
In a first public appearance following the announcement on Thursday, the couple appeared at Windsor Castle, the royal family's residence just west of London and the venue for their civil wedding on April 8.
A beaming Parker Bowles sported a full length fuschia evening gown and a platinum diamond engagement ring a royal heirloom and said Charles had proposed to her on bended knee.
The engagement, which gained public approval from Charles' mother Queen Elizabeth II and his sons, princes William and Harry, was feted at Windsor with a gala dinner for 250 guests.
The event will likely make shopkeepers happy.
An assistant at a sovenir shop, Deep Basra, said: "We think it's going to be good for business.
That's why we opened early today."
In an apparent bid to counter public criticism of their match, the couple have opted for a modest, private ceremony, and announced that Parker Bowles will not be queen once Charles takes the throne.
Clarence House, the prince's London residence, said the wedding would be "a largely private occasion for family and friends", in marked contrast to Charles's sumptuous public wedding to Diana at St. Paul's Cathedral in 1981.
The British public remains deeply loyal to Diana eight years after her death, in a car crash in Paris, and have shown mixed feelings about Charles' wedding to the woman whom she blamed for the breakup of her marriage.
Parker Bowles will not take on Diana's former title, the Princess of Wales, but will be known after the marriage as the Duchess of Cornwall instead.
Once Charles becomes king she will be known as the Princess Consort, instead of queen.
The fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the Church of England, which does not recognize marriage between divorcees.
Both the 56 year old prince, who as king will be titular head of the Church of England, and Parker Bowles, 57, are divorced.
The Anglican head, Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, voiced approval of the union, saying it was "consistent with Church of England guidelines concerning remarriage".
Although marrying a long term mistress is highly unorthodox for a British prince, there are no constitutional barriers.
Far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the British public.
arriage had fallen apart" a reference to the princess's own romantic affairs.
A poll published Friday in the Daily Telegraph showed 65 percent felt Charles and Parker Bowles should be married, compared with 24 percent who were against it.
Thirty years after their first romance, Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, both now graying divorcees, will finally wed in a civil ceremony and put the official seal on a relationship Princess Diana blamed for the breakdown of her marriage to the man who would be king.
In a nod to those who have not warmed to Camilla, the royal family said Thursday she will never hold the title of Queen.
But after the tribulations of a relationship that has played out over three decades, Charles seemed overjoyed to be able to take her as his wife.
"I'm very excited," the usually reserved prince said as he entered London's storied Goldsmith's Hall, home of the gold and silversmiths' guild, and looked at wedding rings.
In their first public appearance together since the announcement, Charles and Camilla smiled broadly as they walked into a reception at Windsor Castle on Thursday night, and the guests applauded.
A radiant Parker Bowles, wearing a fuchsia gown, showed off her engagement ring against a black clutch bag.
She told the crowd the prince had gone down on one knee to propose.
"I'm just coming down to Earth," she said.
The April 8 wedding between the two divorcees will be a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle, in contrast to the pageantry of Charles' 1981 wedding to Diana at St. Paul's Cathedral.
The divorce issue is a delicate matter for the man who would be head of the Church of England.
The engagement ring Charles, 56, has given his fiancee is a royal family heirloom, according to the prince's office, Clarence House.
The platinum band has a square cut central diamond with three diamond baguettes on each side.
Parker Bowles, 57, was to wear it Thursday evening to a dinner at Windsor Castle.
The news of the nuptials was received with warmth in Britain, where public opinion was once so hostile to Camilla that shoppers pelted her with rolls in a supermarket.
The House of Commons burst into cheers at the news, and ordinary Britons offered their congratulations.
Charles and Diana's sons welcomed the announcement.
"We are both very happy for our father and Camilla, and we wish them all the luck in the future," Prince William, 22, and Prince Harry, 20, said in a statement.
One Very Important Person also gave her blessing: Queen Elizabeth II granted the necessary formal permission for the union.
And as mother of the bridegroom said she and Prince Philip "are very happy that the Prince of Wales and Mrs Parker Bowles are to marry."
To mark the royal engagement, the queen decided that the Round Tower at Windsor Castle should be illuminated Thursday night.
The civil marriage will take place at the castle and will be followed by a service of prayer and dedication at St. George's Chapel within the castle walls.
Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, spiritual head of the church of England, will preside, the prince's office at Clarence House said.
Williams said Thursday that the wedding service plans "have my strong support and are consistent with Church of England guidelines concerning remarriage."
The archbishop's approval and participation could well help allay concerns of those with questions about the fitness of the divorced Charles to be supreme governor of church when he becomes king.
In general, the Church of England, the established faith of the nation, disapproves of remarriage of divorced people in church.
There is no Act of Parliament saying the wife of a king should be queen, but it is a historical convention.
Clarence House said there was no legal reason Charles' second wife could not be queen, and that the decision was made by the couple.
When Charles accedes to the throne, his wife will be known as the HRH Her Royal Highness Princess Consort.
Prince Charles, in addition to being Prince of Wales, is Duke of Cornwall and Rothesay.
After her marriage, Parker Bowles will not use the title Princess of Wales, but would like people to call her the Duchess of Cornwall, Clarence House said.
Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was delighted at the impending marriage.
At his regular meeting with the queen Wednesday night, the two discussed the wedding plans, and Blair gave her legal advice before she went on to grant the wedding her royal consent, officials said.
They refused to discuss the advice.
Perhaps the most important vote of approval is still pending.
The British public who took Princess Diana to their hearts have been divided about the Camilla Charles romance.
The nation's tabloid press dubbed Parker Bowles "the other woman" as details of their relationship became public in 1992.
But in the years since Diana's 1997 death in a Paris car crash, much of the ill will against Charles has eased.
The warmth of his relationship with his sons has been seen positively and suggests a warmer character than he is often credited with.
Parker Bowles, who stays well out of the limelight, has won a degree of respect for her discretion.
Many people simply wish them well as a couple whose love has withstood the test of years of anguish and vilification "They are clearly very much in love.
It must be the end of a series of nightmare years for Camilla,They are entitled to have their own happiness the same as everyone else," Winston Churchill, the grandson of Britain's wartime prime minister, told Sky News.
On the streets of central London, many Britons welcomed the announcement but said they may never love Camilla as they had Diana.
"Diana is still in so many people's hearts," said Chris Morris, 54, a building engineer.
"Queen Camilla wouldn't be so popular."
Charles, the queen's eldest son first met Camilla in the early 1970s and they had a brief romance which ended in late 1972 when the prince was called away on naval duties.
Camilla married Andrew Parker Bowles, a long standing admirer, in 1973.
Throughout the late 1970s Charles and Camilla kept in touch, and they became close friends again toward the end of the decade.
They remained so after Charles' 1981 marriage to Diana.
Diana blamed the friendship for the failure of her marriage to the Prince of Wales.
"There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded," Diana said in a 1995 TV interview.
While the saga of the disintegrating royal marriage played out publicly, Parker Bowles was often cast as the villain, the object both of invective for being a "marriage breaker" and of ridicule over tapes of intimate conversations between her and the prince that emerged in 1992.
In 1994, Prince Charles admitted in a TV documentary that he had strayed from his marriage vows, but insisted the infidelity happened only after the marriage was "irretrievably broken down, us both having tried."
It was widely assumed, but never confirmed, that Parker Bowles was the other woman.
Charles and Diana divorced in 1996, a year before she was killed.
Parker Bowles obtained her divorce from army officer Andrew Parker Bowles in 1995.
In April 1997, Parker Bowles took a tentative step into public life when she became patron of the National Osteoporosis Society.
An official photograph was released to mark the occasion.
In July that year, Charles hosted a party for Camilla to celebrate her 50th birthday.
The couple appeared less frequently in public after Diana's death in August 1997, but in 1999 Camilla met Charles' sons Prince William and Prince Harry for the first time.
In recent years, she has regularly accompanied Charles to galas and become accustomed to appearing in front of the media.
Last year, a poll indicated that more Britons support Prince Charles marrying Parker Bowles than oppose it.
Thirty two percent of respondents to the Populus poll said they would support Charles if he remarried, while 29 percent were opposed.
Thirty eight percent said they didn't care and 2 percent had no opinion.
The heir to the British throne's engagement to his controversial love Camilla Parker Bowles elicited Friday a modicum of support both at home and abroad that one pundit predicted will increase with time.
The British news media, which often runs no holds barred stories on the private life of Prince Charles and his royal relatives, held fire for once by praising his plans to remarry on April 8 and saying Charles deserved happiness.
It is "the right time" for Charles to wed his live in girlfriend, whom he has known for more than 30 years, The Times said, praising the "dignity and due care" with which they have acted in recent years.
The coupch, saying that although he jilted their beloved Diana, the prince still deserved "sympathy and understanding".
Snap polls have shown most Britons were cool or even hostile to the marriage plans.
However, David Frost, a prominent British broadcaster and interviewer, said he shared in the delight friends of Charles had for the wedding plans and predicted the public would eventually warm to them.
"I think there will be quite a bit of controversy for 24 hours but then I think everyone will be happy and feel that Prince Charles deserves his happiness," Sir David said.
The mass circulation Daily Mirror struck the same note.
"Admittedly the Prince of Wales behaved badly to Diana,But in that he is no different from thousands upon thousands of men.
It doesn't make it right or acceptable, but it is not a reason for him to spend his life in misery."
"Our love for Diana is still strong and will continue.
But it is time to move on," it added.
"Charles has the right to happiness."
The Sun, Britain's best selling daily paper, celebrated that "at last, Prince Charles makes an honest woman of Camilla Parker Bowles."
And it recalled, "it must be remembered that nobody criticized Diana when she formed new friendships after her marriage had fallen apart" a reference to the princess's own romantic affairs.
The Daily Telegraph also told Britons to "respond with maturity" to the announcement and recalled that his sons "Princes William and Harry are said to want the couple to be happy."
The Daily Express regretted that Parker Bowles and the prince had not wed when their romance was kindled in the 1970s, after a meeting at a polo match.
"If only Charles had been brave enough to go against palace wishes 35 years ago and wed the young, single Camilla Shand, whom he adored, then Diana may have been spared heartbreak good day to get married."
In Australia, people were divided over Prince Charles' plans to re marry, with republicans renewing calls for links to the British crown to be severed and loyalists congratulating the heir to the throne.
In opting for the future title of Princess Consort, Britain's royal bride to be Camilla Parker Bowles will be taking on a flexible public role which can be adapted according to both circumstances and public opinion, experts said Friday.
Following her marriage to heir to the throne Prince Charles on April 8, the 57 year old divorcee will officially become Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall.
Assuming Charles takes over as monarch from his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, Parker Bowles will then assume the specially coined role of Princess Consort, royal officials said in announcing the nuptials on Thursday.
While the British public now largely tolerates the couple's long relationship, opinion polls show Parker Bowles remains notably less popular than Princess Diana, Charles's ex wife who died in a Paris car crash in 1997.
Thus, many pundits have pointed out, making Parker Bowles Princess of Wales Diana's old title or queen would risk massive public ire.
The title of Princess Consort is deliberately vague, experts say, allowing Parker Bowles to shape her public role over time, something greatly helped by the extreme vagueness of Britain's unwritten constitution on such issues.
Apart from the monarch and the heir to the throne, "no other member of the royal family has any constitutional obligations", said Professor Adam Tomkins, a constitutional law expert from Glasgow University in Scotland.
"Think about the current Duke of Edinburgh, the queen's husband.
His role is not constitutionally defined, his role is not constitutionally required or legally mandated in any way," he said.
"These days it looks like one of the considerations that is borne in mind when senior members of the royal family have shaped their role is public opinion."
Public opinion is certainly against a Queen Camilla an opinion poll in Friday's Daily Telegraph newspaper showed that while 40 percent of those asked backed the Princess Consort notion, just seven percent thought she should be queen, with 47 percent wanting no title at all.
Royal pundits believe Parker Bowles will initially keep a low profile, and gradually build up her place in public life through carefully chosen charitable works and the like.
In the Daily Telegraph poll, 57 percent of respondents thought Parker Bowles should carry out the normal duties of a monarch's wife, whatever her title.
Her closest role model is seen as Prince Albert, the husband of 19th century monarch Queen Victoria, who was made Prince Consort and overcame initial public suspicion to become a well loved figure.
Camilla's role was purely a matter for the royal family and government, as there were no constitional issues at stake, Tomkins said.
"Parliament has had the unambiguously clear power since the late 17th century to legislate on any matter of the crown," he said, pointing out that the 1701 Act of Settlement even changed the royal succession.
"So if parliament can change the identity of the monarch,then parliament can certainly decide that we can call her Queen Camilla, or parliament can certainly decide that we can call her Mrs Parker Bowles," he said.
The one sticking point could be opinion in more conservative countries from the Commonwealth, the association of former British colonies, who might not welcome a twice married adulterer as their de facto queen, Tomkins added.
"I think it's extremely unlikely that any constitutional problem will arise in Britain as a result of this marriage, but if any constitutional problem is going to arise as a result of this marriage it is more likely to be a problem for the Commonwealth."
Britain's Prince Charles and bride to be Camilla Parker Bowles kept a low profile Friday as they began their two month engagement ahead oftic, very exciting and good fun," White told AFP.
Both restaurants and souvenir shops were likely to profit from the surge in interest, she added.
In an apparent bid to counter public criticism of their match, the couple have opted for a modest, private ceremony, and announced that Parker Bowles will not be queen once Charles takes the throne.
The British public remains deeply loyal to Diana eight years after her death in a car crash in Paris, and have shown mixed feelings about Charles' wedding to the woman whom Diana blamed for the breakup of her marriage.
Parker Bowles will not take on Diana's former title, the Princess of Wales, but will be known after the marriage as the Duchess of Cornwall instead.
Once Charles becomes king she will be known as the Princess Consort.
The fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the Church of England, which does not permit divorcees to marry again in church.
Both the prince, who as king will be titular head of the Church of England, and Parker Bowles are divorced.
Although marrying a long term mistress is unorthodox for a British prince, there are no constitutional barriers.
Far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the public.
Diana, describing her breakup with Charles and divorce in 1996, famously quipped that "there were three of us in this marriage so it was a bit crowded".
The announcement marks the culmination of a slow but steady transition for the couple, from avoiding being seen together for years to appearing at public events as a couple, and now marriage.
Charles first met Parker Bowles in 1970, but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor, army officer Andrew Parker Bowles.
Although this first marriage lasted until 1995, Parker Bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to Diana.
The Times: After 30 years, Charles puts his affair in order.
The Prince of Wales announced his engagement to Camilla Parker Bowles yesterday after being warned that he had to marry her to avoid a looming constitutional crisis.
The Times has learnt that the Prince was told by his most senior advisers that, effectively, he must choose between marrying or banishing his long term partner.
Mrs Parker Bowles agreed to marriage, but only after being persuaded that the Prince needed to place his personal affairs on a conventional footing before he could become King.
Financial Times: Russsia restricts foreign bids.
Russia will bar foreign owned companies from bidding for the country's most lucrative natural resources this year in the most explicit and sweeping manifestation of a nationalistic state policy developed under the presidency of Vladimir Putin.
The Ministry for Natural Resources said companies would have to be at least 51 per cent Russian owned to take part in this year's tenders for strategic oil and metals deposits.
The rule may prevent oil companies such as ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco from developing new Russian oil reserves, and also stymie TNK BP, a pioneering 50 50 owned Anglo Russian oil company.
Camilla Parker Bowles could not be more different from Princess Diana.
Where Prince Charles' first wife had glamour and magnetism that made her one of the great icons of our age, Parker Bowles seems more at ease tending to a country garden than the luminaries of the social circuit.
It's one of the things that binds her to husband to be Prince Charles both have a passion for the peace of rural life, riding after the hounds and taking long walks.
Despite her discreet manner, Parker Bowles was once widely vilified in Britain.
Diana called her a "Rottweiler."
The tabloid press dubbed her "the other woman."
As details of her relationship with Charles emerged in 1992, irate shoppers at a supermarket pelted her with bread rolls.
But since Diana's death in a 1997 Paris car crash, the public has gradually come to accept her as Charles consort no doubt a major factor in clearing the way for their marriage.
She was born Camilla Shand in London on July 17, 1947, and grew up on a country estate in southern England, a granddaughter of the 3rd Baron of Ashcombe.
It was an upbringing that made her very much at home in the upper class circles of the rural rich.
After attending Queen's Gate School in London's exclusive South Kensington district and finishing schools in Switzerland, she "came out" socially as a debutante in 1965.
Her great grandmother Alice Keppel had a love affair with King Edward VII, Prince Charles's great great grandfather.
The young Camilla is said to have brought that up after meeting the prince at a polo match in the early 1970s.
"My great grandmother was your great great grandfather's mistress, so how about it?" she is reported to have told the prince.
Romance blossomed, but the relationship cooled after Prince Charles went to sea as a naval officer.
Shand married cavalry officer Maj. Andrew Parker Bowles and had a son and daughter, Tom and Laura, in the 1970s.
But Charles and his former love remained close friends, even after his marriage to Lady Diana Spencer.
After Charles and Diana divorced in 1996, Parker Bowles made a few tentative steps out of the shadows and into the prince's life.
The attempt to find public acceptance was suspended in the national trauma over Diana's death, but resumed and slowly succeeded.
Newspapers began to note that Parker Bowles, so unlike Diana and even Charles, was very discreet and never could be lured into commenting on the royal marriage breakup.
This and the fact that she clearly had no interest in fame and celebrity, went some way to winning a degree of public acceptance.
The announcement that she will not become queen when Charles becomes king, is probably an indication that both accept divisions in public feeling over the acceptability of a divorced woman as queen.
And in the future bride's wish to be referred to as the Duchess of Cornwall, not the Princess of Wales, there may be a tacit understanding that the memory of Diana, Princess of Wales, will remain respected.
A group that wants Australia to sever its ties with the British monarchy reported a surge in new members Friday after Prince Charles said he will marry longtime companion Camilla Parker Bowles.
The Australian Republican Movement (ARM) said its Web site has been overwhelmed with hundreds of membership applications since news of the April 8 wedding broke Thursday night Australian time.
ARM chairman John Warhurst said the "surge in interest" could not be described as anti Parker Bowles, demonized as the mistress whom Princess Diana blamed for breaking up her marriage with the prince, which ended in divorce in 1996.
"There's no anti Camilla feeling by any means, Charles is the issue for republicans but she'll come along with the package as the wife of our head of state," Warhurst said.
But it's "Charles, who hasn't been here in 11 years that ignites people's republican passions."
Prime Minister John Howard, however, rejected as "silly" the argument that the marriage will renew calls to change Australia into a republic from a constitutional monarchy with the British king or queen as its head of state.
Australians voted to retain the monarchy in a 1999 referendum.
"I don't think it's got anything to do with the debate about the constitutional monarchy," Howard told Nine Network television.
"It's about the lives of two people."
"I congratulate them, I wish them well, I think it's sensible and a good thing that they've decided to marry," he added.
A Newspoll survey last month found that 46 percent of Australian adults want a republic compared to 35 percent who favor maintaining the constitutional monarchy.
Australia became an independent state in 1901.
But, like many former outposts of the British Empire such as Canada, it still recognizes Britain's monarch as head of state.
The queen's representative in Australia is the governor general, a largely ceremonial role, but one with potentially sweeping powers, including the ability to dismiss a government and the prime minister something that has happened only once, in 1975.
Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy (ACM) accused the ARM of intruding "into this happy occasion" to revive interest in their cause.
New Zealand's Anglican Church welcomed the announcement.
"As a church leader, I think it's far better that he should marry and have a clear married relationship if he is actually living with this person," Bishop of Christchurch, David Coles, said.
Parker Bowles will not accompany the Prince Charles when he departs this month on a tour of Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, officials said.
Prince Charles may have been unlucky in love in the past, but if Hong Kong's famed fortune tellers are anything to go by, his marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles will be a great success.
Chinese soothsayers Friday predicted a happy and long marriage for the heir to the British throne, who announced he would wed his long time lover Parker Bowles on April 8.
"April 8 will be auspicious for people born in the Year of the Rat," feng shui Master Edwin Ma told AFP, referring to Charles' Chinese zodiac sign.
"It is a good day to get married."
Chinese fortune tellers divine the future by consulting ancient Chinese almanacs based on astrological observations.
They also take into consideration the relative weights of forces that Chinese folklore believes emanate from all things, especially specific "elements" that are said to dominate different years.
In the present Year of the Rooster, the element of metal predominates.
However, Charles a keen believer in mysticism was born in 1948 under the influence of the element of water.
Parker Bowles was born in 1947, the Year of the Pig, also a water sign.
"That is good, because the metal element will burn the water," Ma explained.
"It will bring good fortune in the marriage."
Fellow feng shui Master Leung Tin ming warned however that the marriage would not be without its challenges.
"As this is their second marriage they will be better at keeping it stable ,but in many ways it will not be a normal marriage," Yeung told AFP.
"They will be apart for lots of the time and that will put stress on the relationship and also on Prince Charles' ability to carry out his duties."
The forecast, courtesy of the United Nations, is grim.
Today, more than a billion people lack access to safe drinking water.
Polluted water contributes, each year, to the death of about 15 million children under age 5.
By midcentury, between 2 billion and 7 billion people will face water shortages.
"No region will be spared from the impact of this crisis," Koichiro Matsuura, director general of Unesco, recently warned.
"Water supplies are falling while the demand is dramatically growing."
He estimated that in the next two decades the average amount of water available per person on the planet will shrink by a third.
But the United Nations is also working hard on solutions, helping poor countries learn a subtle art that lets them better manage their water resources to avoid tragedy.
The method is known as isotope hydrology.
Cheap and reliable, it takes advantage of the fact that water molecules carry unique fingerprints, based in part on differing proportions of the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes that constitute all water.
Isotopes are forms of the same element that have variable numbers of neutrons in their nuclei.
Using the tools of isotope hydrology, scientists can discover the age, origins, size, flow, and fate of a water source.
And that information, in turn, can guide sound water use policy, letting water engineers better map underground aquifers, conserve supplies and control pollution.
For instance, if the method reveals that the water in a well is young and recently derived from rain, villagers can pump away vigorously.
But if it turns out to be very old what scientists call fossil water they need to move gingerly, taking care not to exhaust the water supply.
"You take it out once, like oil," Werner Burkart, head of the nuclear science programs of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview.
The U.N. group, best known for fighting the spread of nuclear arms, is leading the hydrology effort.
Based in Vienna, Austria, it works at developing techniques as well as sharing them with scientists around the world.
"We do a lot of capability building and training of local people, so it becomes sustainable so we don't have to inject support all the time," said Ana Maria Cetto, the agency's head of technical cooperation.
"They're building their own capacity to manage their own resources."
A little money goes a long way.
Each year, the isotope hydrology program spends only about $2 million on research and $5 million to aid developing states.
Still, that is enough to finance 84 projects in more than 50 countries, including Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Morocco, and Senegal.
"If you look at the Middle East, everywhere you are using old water," said Pradeep Aggarwal, the head of the agency's isotope hydrology unit.
"It was laid down 10000, maybe 100000 years ago.
So you have to understand there's a limit to how long this will go."
After more than 25 years of cooperative work, the agency has gathered so much information that it is now fashioning a detailed portrait of the planet's water resources that could help prevent future crises and reduce regional friction that may erupt in water wars.
"We're talking about food security, sustainable development," Aggarwal said.
"If it's based on unsustainable water resources, you jeopardize everything."
Oceans and seas constitute 97 percent of the planet's waters.
The remaining 3 percent is fresh water, most locked up as ice, soil moisture, and deep groundwater.
What is available to people mainly as rivers, lakes, aquifers, reservoirs and wetlands comes down to less than 1 percent.
Using that fresh water wisely requires considerable knowledge of the Earth's water cycle, the outlines of which are well known, centering on evaporation and rain, runoff and seepage.
But local riddles abound.
The puzzles can include how often a particular body of water is renewed, where it flows, and whether different bodies are physically linked through underground flows.
In the past, water engineers would address such unknowns by carefully measuring rain and the levels of rivers and other bodies of water for many decades typically a half century or more.
It usually took that long to learn the subtleties of the local cycles.
However, isotope hydrology can do it in days, quickly illuminating water's passage through the depths.
"You really need to know how the water gets in and moves," said Aggarwal.
"Isotopics let you do that in a cost effective way."
The raw material is everywhere.
Air, soil and water naturally contain oxygen in two forms oxygen 16 and oxygen 18, which has two extra neutrons in its nucleus.
Oxygen 18 represents about 1 oxygen atom in every 500.
Because it is heavier than oxygen 16, more is left behind when water evaporates.
As a result, seawater is rich in oxygen 18, rain and snow are relatively poor, and increasingly so the further inland they fall.
These gradients are echoed underground.
The tools of isotope hydrology let scientists see the differences, creating a window into the depths.
For instance, comparing samples from different wells can reveal if the groundwater mixes or becomes isolated in separate pools.
In Ethiopia, the International Atomic Energy Agency used such techniques to help a foundering project.
To supply water to the capital, Addis Ababa, the Ethiopians drilled 25 large wells, assuming that a not too distant river would renew the aquifer.
But when the pumping started, water levels fell much faster than predicted.
"They didn't understand the hydrology," Aggarwal recalled.
"They came to us for help."
In a two day survey, the agency discovered little connection between the river and the wells, prompting an overhaul of the project that put new emphasis on judicious use.
Scientists have now mapped the speed and direction of the area's limited groundwater flow.
Ethiopia's reaction to the episode was to demand that its water scientists put greater emphasis on isotope hydrology, making it "a standard tool for the country," said Mohamed ElBaradei, the agency's director general.
Over continents and wide lands, the study of isotope signatures can reveal if aquifers flow under national borders, helping neighbors collaborate on the intelligent use of scarce water.
That is just what the atomic energy agency is doing in the blistering heat of the Eastern Sahara desert, with Libya, Chad, Egypt and Sudan.
They have joined together to map the shared water resources of the Nubian aquifer, a vast subterranean body whose lobes range over nearly a million square miles, an area bigger than Iran and Iraq combined.
"We're trying to elucidate the connections," said Mokdad Maksoudi, an expert on African technical cooperation at the agency.
"Some parts of the aquifer are very old, with fossil water.
Some are recharged through the Nile.
"We're trying to understand the recharge, so the countries can precisely gauge the best policies," he said.
The stakes are high because areas of fossil water are vulnerable to quick depletion.
A main goal of isotope hydrology is to discover the age of groundwater, defined as the last time it had contact with the atmosphere.
This is calculated in many ways.
Cool temperatures, for example, lower the concentrations of oxygen 18, and thus, unusually low amounts of the atom in groundwater imply that the body of water arose long ago, during ice ages and cooler climatic eras.
A more exact way to determine age is to measure carbon 14, a radioactive isotope that water bears in minute quantities and that, with clocklike precision, steadily decays into other substances, allowing researchers to calculate the elapsed time.
Scientists have used such methods to address a humanitarian crisis in Bangladesh that the World Health Organization calls the "largest mass poisoning of a population in history."
Millions of people in Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, drink arsenic contaminated water, the poison gradually debilitating its victims before spawning cancers that kill them.
Good intentions lay behind this horror.
For decades, the government and aid groups had urged people to give up pond water, often a carrier of lethal disease, and instead to dig shallow wells.
But no one tested the aquifers for arsenic.
For years, the atomic energy agency and its isotope hydrologists, using the carbon 14 and oxygen 18 methods, have worked closely with the Bangladeshis to help them map aquifer mazes and identify safer water supplies.
The news is mixed.
The scientists have found that the arsenic tends to reside in shallow aquifers, and that deeper levels bear none of the deadly poison.
In some cases, however, these deep aquifers have connections to the shallower ones, and pumping them out could draw in the contaminated water.
"So you can have water at 100 meters that is arsenic free today, but could become polluted in the future," Aggarwal said.
He added that the teams have discovered even deeper waters that are unconnected to the surface and will probably stay pure.
But the isotope dating methods show that these very deep aquifers are old and not undergoing renewal, calling for careful conservation.
"If you pump it out in a major way," he said, "it will hurt."
The flow of detailed hydrological information, he said, has been "a tremendous boost" to the government's understanding and has helped it make substantial changes in policy.
"Part of solving the problem," Aggarwal said, "is to understand its origin and extent."
Experts agree that hydrology will become even more important in the future, as growing water shortages intensify conflicts between states, whether or not they result in water wars.
Some analysts see clean water as poised to supplant oil as the world's most contested natural resource.
Burkart of the atomic energy agency said that reliable information about the hidden world of water could only help dissipate international tensions.
"The more you know," he said, "the better."
Some Texas geologists believe the best way to get rid of the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels is to simply put it back where it came from.
On Monday, scientists began burying 3000 tons of compressed carbon dioxide 1 mile beneath an old oil field near Dayton.
If the plan works, most carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas could be captured from area smokestacks and stored harmlessly underground, not pumped into the atmosphere.
"We're going to test every aspect of this to determine whether it is safe," said lead researcher Susan Hovorka, with the University of Texas at Austin's Bureau of Economic Geology.
So called carbon sequestration is not a new idea.
Scientists have experimented with storing the gas on the ocean floor and thousands of feet below ground.
Norway has already buried nearly 70 million tons below the North Sea in the space where it had extracted fuels.
Annually, man made sources of carbon dioxide emit 7 to 10 billion tons of the gas.
Capturing a major chunk of those emissions, and storing them deep below ground, could ease global warming problems, scientists say, while giving the world time to move away from fossil fuel dependency.
The effort by UT geologists, in conjunction with scientists from other labs nationwide, is the first major attempt to determine whether the sandstone layer beneath the Texas and Louisiana coasts makes a good carbon dioxide reservoir.
For the next two weeks, trucks from Baytown and Louisiana will deliver compressed carbon dioxide to the site in Liberty County.
Using a modified oil well, the researchers will pump the gas into sandstone deposits 5050 feet below ground.
There the gas so compressed it is almost a liquid soaks into the sandstone and saltwater, like bubbles in Coca Cola, Hovorka said.
Among the team's concerns is that too much pressure may cause the shale layer atop the sandstone to crack, or might even cause a small earthquake.
But Hovorka said such problems can be solved by closely monitoring the pressure where the gas enters the ground.
As for leaks, the research team has calculated that just 1 percent of the gas will seep into the atmosphere after 300 years.
The group has chemically "tagged" the gas they are burying so they can measure if any returns to the surface in the coming weeks and months.
Even at relatively high concentrations, carbon dioxide is not harmful.
After all, anyone who drinks a carbonated beverage inhales it.
And now the gas is simply being dumped into the atmosphere, so a little returning to the surface poses no danger, Hovorka said.
Environmentalists said the plan is worth pursuing.
"If it's something that can be done reliably and safely, then this is one way to mitigate against the impact of greenhouse gas emissions," said Ramon Alvarez, an atmospheric scientist in the Texas office of Environmental Defense.
Should burying the carbon dioxide below ground prove safe and reliable, the next hurdle will be cost, scientists say.
Removing carbon dioxide from fossil fuel fumes would be expensive, as would building the infrastructure to transport the gas below ground.
But Hovorka said the price tag would not be exorbitant.
For pennies on the dollar more than current electric rates, she said, people could use fossil fuels with cleaner air and consciences.
President Bush, in one of the least noticed gestures of his European visit, has pledged to help developing nations such as China and India cut back on their fast growing output of the greenhouse gases linked to global warming.
Bush signed a pact with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Wednesday to help poorer countries adopt more energy efficient technologies in power generation, transportation and industry.
Although the agreement lacked specific commitments for new spending, diplomats and analysts say it could help take political pressure off the United States, the world's largest polluter, and remove a major obstacle to achieving the goals set out in the Kyoto Protocol, the agreement on climate change that went into effect Feb 16 despite a U.S. boycott.
The Bush Schroeder agreement "can be very meaningful as a start.
It can get the United States and developing countries on board," said ZhongXiang Zhang, an energy and climate policy analyst at the East West Center, a think tank in Honolulu.
The Kyoto Protocol's weak point is that even as wealthy nations cut back on pollution, greenhouse gas emissions from China, India and other developing nations keep rising at a sizzling rate.
China's emissions of carbon dioxide, the most common greenhouse gas, are rising at more than twice the rate of the United States, while Germany's overall output is dropping.
In fact, China is widely projected to overtake the United States as the world's top source of greenhouse gases by 2025.
"China is building a new 1000 megawatt power plant every week with old, Eisenhower era technology," said Douglas Ogden, director of the China program at the Energy Foundation in San Francisco.
"They're going to keep building the oldest, dirtiest plants unless we do something.
The world can ill afford even one greenhouse gas producer on the U.S. scale, let alone two."
China and other developing nations are exempted from the Kyoto Protocol's rules for emission cutbacks because their governments are afraid the limits would hobble their rise from poverty.
"The European side wants hard targets from the United States and developing countries, which is ,very difficult," Zhang said.
"But if they can work together to subsidize advanced technologies ,it would be very positive."
The key to the U.S. German initiative is the most polluting of major energy sources coal.
Schroeder and British Prime Minister Tony Blair are pressing Bush to join them in creating an ambitious aid program to help developing nations adopt new technologies that reduce emissions from coal power plants and save energy.
Blair holds the annual rotating presidency of the G 8, the group of industrialized nations, and he says he will make the proposal a top priority for the group's summit meeting in July.
Although environmentalists advocate the expansion of wind and solar energy production, China and India are expected to continue to rely on their huge reserves of coal for most of their energy needs in the near future.
The two countries derive 80 percent and 65 percent, respectively, of their electricity from coal, compared to the U.S. share of 51 percent.
"Coal is really the workhorse for the economies of India and China in the decades to come, so that's why coal is so important for global warming," said Bernd Kramer, minister counselor for science, technology and environment at the German Embassy in Washington.
In the next eight years, China expects to put into operation 562 coal fired plants nearly half the world's total and India is projected to add 213 such plants, according to government figures.
The United States is expected to build only 72.
For years, the U.S. government has invested heavily in clean energy research.
For 2005, it budgeted nearly $3 billion for research and development of climate change technology, mostly through subsidies and tax breaks for work on hydrogen fuel cell developments and so called clean coal technology, which releases less carbon dioxide.
Hydrogen fuel cells are widely believed to be 15 to 20 years away from commercial viability, while clean coal technology is already on the market.
The most prominent clean coal method goes by the cumbersome name of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle, or IGCC.
Under the process, coal is turned into a gas, which is then burned in a process that allows carbon dioxide to be siphoned off rather than released into the atmosphere.
Plants built with this technology release 15 percent less carbon dioxide and can be combined with a futuristic option called "carbon sequestration," in which the carbon dioxide byproduct is injected into oil and gas aquifers underground, eliminating emissions altogether.
What is needed now is not further research but aid to get these two methods to market, say Schroeder, Blair and many experts.
One prominent environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, has estimated that the extra cost of using IGCC and carbon sequestration in all plants being built in developing nations would be just $6 billion a year.
"This amount would be a huge investment in global security, and it is very low compared to the $50 billion that the G 8 gave in development assistance last year," said David Hawkins, the council's climate policy director.
If China, India and other nations start snapping up this new technology, a big winner could be San Francisco's Bechtel Corp., which has already built two coal fired power plants and two nuclear plants in China, with several more under construction or projected.
Bechtel recently formed an alliance with General Electric Co. to develop IGCC power plants.
Amos Avidan, a principal vice president of Bechtel, said China is eager to make its power plants cleaner and reduce the nation's severe air pollution.
The IGCC technology "hasn't yet taken off," Avidan said, "but we believe it can become a mainstream technology in a couple of years or so and eliminate the cost gap.
We think it has great potential for China."
Other industry analysts are more skeptical.
"The problem with these leapfrog technologies is they have a well proven track record of mostly failing," said Dale Simbeck, vice president of technology for SFA Pacific Inc., a Mountain View energy industry consulting firm.
He noted that there are only two IGCC power plants operating in the United States, despite two decades of federal subsidies.
One failed attempt was the Pinon Pine power plant, an IGCC plant near Reno completed in 2000 at a price tag of $335 million, split equally between a local power company and the U.S. Energy Department.
The plant has been plagued by technical snafus and has never been fully operational.
Simbeck, who has worked as a consultant on China power issues for the World Bank and the Chinese government, said China has enough technological know how.
Its main barrier, he said, is rigid government policies that shield state owned power companies from competition.
"The Chinese are just telling the West what it wants 'Help us build with IGCC, please help fund these with our companies' but it's not necessary," he said.
Lee Schipper, director of transportation research for World Resources Institute in Washington, said China's reputation as a big polluter is unfair.
The Beijing government is spending billions of dollars annually on pollution prevention, he noted.
China's efficiency programs are getting a boost from European and Bay Area experts.
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is working with the Energy Foundation on a host of programs, ranging from consumer appliance standards to building codes.
And the California Air Resources Board has helped Chinese federal and state governments set up air quality monitoring programs.
"China is improving at many times the rate of improvement in the United States," Schipper said.
"The Bush administration should be getting its own carbon house in order instead."
EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson predicted Wednesday that safeguarding the country's water supply both from terrorists and pollutants will be the environmental issue of the coming decades.
"I believe water, over the next decade and further, will be the environmental issue that we as a nation and, frankly, as a world will be facing," he said.
Keeping the nation's water safe and secure, he added, is "an area of vulnerability for the United States and also an opportunity for us."
The first scientist to head the agency, Johnson said that in addition to helping the Department of Homeland Security secure the water supply, he wanted to find economically viable solutions for the 10 percent of Americans whose drinking water is not healthy and for cities and municipalities facing huge bills to improve aging water treatment facilities.
In his first interview with reporters since being confirmed by the Senate last month, Johnson, a 54 year old biologist and career official at the Environmental Protection Agency, also talked about controversies that recently have plagued the agency.
Asked about charges this week by an unnamed EPA scientist that the Bush administration had watered down reports about global climate change, Johnson talked about the need for good communications and sound science.
"We have a number of people inside the agency and across administrations that look at the documents to try to make sure that we are staying true to the science and at the same time communicating effectively," he said.
"And on any particular issue if the way it is said isn't your particular leaning or viewpoint, then you say 'You've compromised the science,' or 'You haven't done a good job of communicating.'
" Conceding the existence of climate change but not ready to predicts its severity or its causes, Johnson said, "My focus is on advancing technologies and achieving real results."
He touted a program he called Methane to Market, which captures methane gases for energy use.
"The answer is going to be the technologies," he said.
"Why aren't we focusing on making that a reality rather than the rhetoric of global climate change?"
A native of Washington, D.C., Johnson said that after almost 25 years at the agency, he is well familiar with political rhetoric from the business and environmental communities as well as from Congress, the public and the press.
"I've heard it all," he said.
"I don't want to waste time focusing on the rhetoric.
I want to get past that."
Johnson took Congress to task for failing to ratify international environmental treaties that the United States has signed on to including the Persistent Organic Pollutant Treaty, which reduces or eliminates the production, use or release of 12 toxic chemicals.
The United States, a leader in pressing for the agreement, signed the treaty on May 23, 2001.
Congress has yet to ratify the pact.
He made no mention of the U.S. refusal to sign on to the Kyoto international agreement to restrict greenhouse gases, which took effect in 140 nations earlier this year.
Both Congress and President Bush have opposed it, advocating voluntary steps instead.
Noting that treaties can take years to negotiate and then ratify, Johnson said of the organic pollutant pact, "Frankly, I don't want to wait."
While he said he would prefer a legislative solution to a regulatory one, Johnson said he would forge ahead if Congress does not act as the EPA did in March in issuing a rule limiting mercury emissions from new and existing coal fired power plants.
"We've got a Mercury problem internationally," Johnson said.
He said he hopes to share "the very technologies that we're going to use in the United States for dealing with mercury control" such as techniques called activated carbon injection or carbon sequestration with other countries that are contributing to the mercury problem, like China.
He also advocated bridging shortfalls in the U.S. energy supply with alternatives from nuclear to solar, and he foresaw the day when environmental requirements could be "the driver" of economic progress.
"We as a nation are facing significant shortfalls," he said.
"Either we at EPA can be a stumbling block or we can provide incentives."
Oil group BP PLC said Thursday it has formed a joint venture with ConocoPhillips, Shell Transport & Trading Co. and Scottish and Southern Energy to begin work on a project to generate "carbon free" electricity from hydrogen.
BP said the project, which would make use of a power station in northern Scotland and export the carbon dioxide to a North Sea oil reservoir, would require total capital investment of some US$600 million (euro497 million).
Initial engineering feasibility studies have been completed, BP said, and the partners are now working to confirm the economic viability of the project.
BP said it expects that review to be completed in the second half of 2006, allowing a final investment decision to be made next year.
If approved, the group plans to start operation of the project in 2009.
"This is an important and unique project configured at a scale that can offer significant progress in the provision of cleaner energy and the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions," said BP Chief Executive Lord Browne.
"For example, if applied to just 5 percent of the new electricity generating capacity that the world is projected to require by 2050, such schemes would have the potential to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by around 1 billion tons a year a material step in the challenge the world faces," he added.
In its March 2005 budget, the British government announced that it is examining the potential for new economic incentives to support the development of carbon capture and storage technologies and applications.
The BP led project would convert natural gas to hydrogen and carbon dioxide gases, then use the hydrogen gas as fuel for a 350 megawatt power station near Peterhead, northern Scotland, and export the carbon dioxide to a North Sea oil reservoir for increased oil recovery and ultimate storage.
When fully operational, the project would be expected to capture and store around 1.3 million tons of carbon dioxide each year and provide 'carbon free' electricity to the equivalent of a quarter of a million U.K. homes.
BP said the project would reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere by the power generation by over 90 percent.
Britain is to study whether global warming can be curbed by "capturing" carbon dioxode from power stations and storing it underground in old oil and gas fields, ministers said Tuesday.
The government has committed 40 million pounds (60 million euros, 72 million dollars) for research on the technology, known as carbon sequestration, or carbon capture.
The method should be operational within a decade and could eventually prove a major export earner for Britain as other countries begin to adopt climate change reducing techniques, Energy Minister Malcolm Wicks said.
The theory is that fossil fuel power stations, oil rigs and other energy burners would hold on to waste gases such as carbon dioxode and methane, rather than releasing them into the atmosphere.
Carbon dioxode and methane are among what are known as greenhouse gases, increased concentrations of which in the earth's atmosphere have been blamed by scientists for global warming.
Under the British plan, the captured gases would be pumped underground into spent oil and gas fields.
"Reaching our ambitious target of cutting carbon emissions by 60 percent by 2050 means action now to support emerging technologies that will enable us to burn coal and gas more cleanly," Wicks told BBC radio, "At the same time, with major expansion of coal fired power generation expected in China and India, we want to put the UK at the forefront of what could be a valuable new export opportunity."
Carbon capture could reduce emissions from power plants by up to 85 percent, he added.
Tony Juniper, director of environmental group Friends of the Earth, welcomed the initiative but warned there were "many challenges" ahead.
"First of all, are there enough geological deposits that can keep this gas out of the atmosphere for long enough to make a difference?
Can we get it there effectively?
Can we transport it in a way that is technically feasible?" he told BBC radio.
"And then, of course, what is going to be the cost of implementing this technology?"
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has pledged to make tackling climate change one of the main priorities of next month's summit of the Group of Eight (G8) rich nations' club in Gleneagles, Scotland.
The G8 on Friday declared climate change a "serious and long term challenge," pointed a finger of blame at fossil fuels and looked to smart technology and cooperation with big emerging economies to tackle the problem.
"Climate change is a serious and long term challenge that has the potential to affect every part of the globe," the world's eight most powerful countries said in a declaration here at the end of their three day summit.
"We know that increased need and use of energy from fossil fuels, and other human activities, contribute in large part to increases in greenhouse gases associated with the warming of our Earth's surface."
"We know enough to act now to put ourselves on a path to slow and, as the science justifies, stop and then reverse the growth of greenhouse gases," they said, pledging to act "with resolve and urgency."
The declaration was issued by the Group of Eight along with a "Gleneagles Plan of Action" for combatting global warming and promoting clean energy.
The two documents marked the club's greatest acknowledgement so far about the cause and scale of global warming, a phenomenon that has shifted from the wings to the centre of the world's political stage in less than a quarter century.
And they succeeded in bridging a rift between the United States, the world's biggest single culprit for greenhouse gases, and the other G8 countries.
They have fought for more than four years as to whether a voluntary approach or binding caps on pollution emissions are the best way to tackle global warming.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair hailed the compromise as a big step forward.
"If it isn't possible to bring America into the consensus on tackling the issue of climate change we will never ensure that the huge emerging economies, particularly those of China and India, who are going to consume more energy than any other part of the world, that they are part of a dialogue," Blair said.
"And if we cannot have America as part of the dialogue on climate change and if we can't have India and China as part of a dialogue there is no possibility of us succeeding in resolving this issue."
But the deal fell miles short of the demands from scientists and green groups.
They had demanded a deadline and a target for cuts in the fossil fuel gases that are warming Earth's atmosphere and disrupting its climate system.
"Thanks to the Bush administration, the world's biggest polluters have given little hope to those already suffering from climate change, especially those in Africa who will be hit hardest," said WWF's Jennifer Morgan.
"Technology is important but without real targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is simply not enough."
The summit called for investment in clean energy technology, such as hydrogen, gave only a passing encouragement for renewables but a flourish of verbal support for technologies that greens say are dangerous or untested.
These include "clean" coal and carbon sequestration, in which carbon dioxide gas is pumped into geological chambers and stored there, rather than released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned in power stations.
The summit also said it noted efforts to sustain and update nuclear power in those G8 countries which have a commitment to nuclear plants.
References to the fast growing mountain of scientific evidence, which say climate change is already happening and could be catastrophic, were absent.
And mentions of the "K word" the Kyoto Protocol were pared to a minimum in deference to the United States.
Talks on what happens after Kyoto runs out in 2012 start in November.
"Let's be very clear," said Blair.
"We were never to be able at this G8 to resolve disagreement over Kyoto nor to renegotiate a set of targets for countries in place of the Kyoto Protocol."
US President George W. Bush is implacably hostile to the UN pact, saying it would cripple the US economy by its demands to curb fossil fuel pollution, and is unfair because China and India are not included in the targeted emissions cuts.
With that argument in mind, the summit declared it sought a "dialogue" with developing countries on tackling greenhouse gases that would be launched at a conference in Britain on November 1.
Over the past four years, scientists have sounded ever louder warnings about global warming.
But these these alarms have run into political resistance and worries about the cost of greater energy efficiency and the switch to cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels.
Almost a decade ago, Tampa Electric opened an innovative power plant that turned coal, the most abundant but the dirtiest fossil fuel, into a relatively clean gas, which it burns to generate electricity.
Not only did the plant emit significantly less pollution than a conventional coal fired power plant, but it was also 10 percent more efficient.
Hazel R. O'Leary, the secretary of energy at the time, went to the plant, situated between Tampa and Orlando, and praised it for ushering in a "new era for clean energy from coal."
Federal officials still refer to the plant's "integrated gasification combined cycle" process as a "core technology" for the future, especially because of its ability eventually to all but eliminate the greenhouse gases linked to global warming.
Since that plant opened, however, not a single similar plant has been built in the United States.
Abundant supplies of natural gas a bit cleaner and, until recently, a lot cheaper stood in the way.
But even now, with gas prices following oil prices into the stratosphere and power companies turning back to coal, most new plants about nine out of 10 on the drawing board will not use integrated gasification combined cycle technology.
The reason is fairly simple.
A plant with the low pollution, high efficiency technology demonstrated at the Tampa Electric plant is about 20 percent more expensive to build than a conventional plant that burns pulverized coal.
This complicates financing, especially in deregulated markets, while elsewhere utilities must persuade regulators to set aside their customary standard of requiring utilities to use their lowest cost alternatives.
(A federal grant of $143 million covered about a fourth of the construction cost of the Tampa Electric plant, which was originally a demonstration project.)
The technology's main long term advantage the ability to control greenhouse gas emissions is not winning over many utilities because the country does not yet regulate those gases.
That could be a problem for future national policy, critics say, because the plants being planned today will have a lifetime of a half century or more.
"It's a very frightening specter that we are going to essentially lock down our carbon emissions for the next 50 years before we have another chance to think about it again," said Jason S. Grumet, the executive director of the National Commission on Energy Policy.
The commission, an independent, bipartisan advisory body, has recommended that the federal government spend an additional $4 billion over 10 years to speed the power industry's acceptance of the technology.
In a recent report, the commission concluded that "the future of coal and the success of greenhouse gas mitigation policies may well hinge to a large extent on whether this technology can be successfully commercialized and deployed over the next 20 years."
Grumet was more succinct.
Integrated gasification combined cycle technology, combined with the sequestration of carbon stripped out in the process, "is as close to a silver bullet as you're ever going to see," he said.
Until Congress regulates carbon emissions a move that many in the industry consider inevitable, but unlikely soon gasification technology will catch on only as its costs gradually come down.
Edward Lowe, general manager of gasification for GE Energy, a division of General Electric that works with Bechtel to build integrated gasification combined cycle plants, said that would happen as more plants were built.
The premium should disappear entirely after the first dozen or so are completed, he added.
Even now, Lowe said, the technology offers operational cost savings that offset some of the higher construction costs.
And if Congress eventually does limit carbon emissions, as many utility executives say they expect it to do, the technology's operational advantages could make it a bargain.
James E. Rogers, the chief executive of Cinergy, a heavily coal dependent Midwestern utility, is one of the technology's biggest industry supporters.
"I'm making a bet on gasification," he said, because he assumes a carbon constrained world is inevitable.
"I don't see any other way forward," he said.
The operating savings of such plants start with more efficient combustion: They make use of at least 15 percent more of the energy released by burning coal than conventional plants do, so less fuel is needed.
The plants also need about 40 percent less water than conventional coal plants, a significant consideration in arid Western states.
But for some people, including Rogers and other utility leaders who anticipate stricter pollution limits, the primary virtue of integrated gasification combined cycle plants is their ability to chemically strip pollutants from gasified coal more efficiently and cost effectively, before it is burned, rather than trying to filter it out of exhaust.
Proponents say that half of coal's pollutants including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to acid rain and smog can be chemically stripped out before combustion.
So can about 95 percent of the mercury in coal, at about a tenth the cost of trying to scrub it from exhaust gases racing up a smokestack.
The biggest long term draw for gasification technology is its ability to capture carbon before combustion.
If greenhouse gas limits are enacted, that job will be much harder and more expensive to do with conventional coal fired plants.
Lowe, the GE executive, estimated that capturing carbon would add about 25 percent to the cost of electricity from a combined cycle plant burning gasified coal, but that it would add 70 percent to the price of power from conventional plants.
Gasification technology, although new to the power sector, has been widely used in the chemical industry for decades, and the general manager of the gasification plant run by Tampa Electric, Mark Hornick, said it was not difficult to train his employees to run the plant.
Tampa Electric is the principal subsidiary of TECO Energy of Tampa.
Disposing of the carbon dioxide gas stripped out in the process, however, is another matter.
Government laboratories have experimented with dissolving the gas in saline aquifers or pumping it into geologic formations under the sea.
The petroleum industry has long injected carbon dioxide into oil fields to help push more crude to the surface.
Refining and commercializing these techniques is a significant part of a $35 billion package of clean energy incentives that the National Commission on Energy Policy is recommending.
The Senate considered some of those ideas in a big energy policy bill last week, but it is doubtful whether Congress will approve the funds to enact them because they are tied to regulating carbon emissions for the first time, something that many industry leaders and sympathetic lawmakers oppose.
Still, the energy bill may have some incentives for industry to adopt gasification technology, and the Department of Energy will continue related efforts.
These include FutureGen, a $950 million project to demonstrate gasification's full potential not just for power plants but as a source of low carbon liquid fuels for cars and trucks as well, and, further out, as a source of hydrogen fuel.
Regardless of the politics of carbon caps, the Energy Department has made it clear that it intends to push the development of integrated gasification combined cycle technology.
Last month, for example, Mark Maddox, a deputy assistant secretary, said at an industry gathering that the technology "is needed in the mix needed now."
Some industry leaders are skeptical, to say the least.
"We would not want to put all of our eggs in one basket as far as a single technology is concerned," said William Fang, deputy counsel for the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association whose members, shareholder owned utilities, account for three quarters of the country's generating capacity.
Besides, he added, many of his members think that mandatory carbon controls, in place in much of the world since the Kyoto Protocol came into force in February, can be kept at bay in the United States possibly indefinitely.
It's a risky strategy for industry and for the climate.
"Coal fired plants are big targets," said Judi Greenwald of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, "and if we do get serious about climate change, they are going to be on the list of things to do quite early."
SEARCH IS ON FOR A WAY TO TRAP PLANET HEATING CARBON DIOXIDE Moving in Washington and financial categories for release Sunday, Aug 21.
WASHINGTON With the world poised to generate huge volumes of carbon dioxide in the next 25 years, experts say the need to capture the planet heating gas and store it in safe places is becoming urgent and increasingly feasible.
Using available technologies, carbon dioxide (CO2) can be captured and pumped into geologic formations deep underground, scientists say.
The technique might add as little as 25 cents to the cost of a gallon of gasoline or $40 a month to a typical residential electric bill, a Princeton University scientist estimates, and the cost would be expected to fall as innovations are developed.
A group at Arizona State University is investigating another approach, with estimated costs that are considerably higher but coming down.
It would involve combining CO2 with plentiful minerals to form substances that would be chemically stable for millions of years.
The cost of allowing the heat trapping gas to remain in the atmosphere could be far higher.
Nearly all atmospheric scientists believe that increases in CO2 and other "greenhouse gases" have caused the Earth's surface temperature to rise.
Many fear the concentration is approaching the point known as "dangerous anthropogenic interference," when altered weather patterns, rising and acidified seas, and other unforeseen changes could bring about global havoc.
Nevertheless, projected economic growth over the next few decades imply drastic increases in the atmospheric concentrations of the dominant greenhouse gas, CO2, which is produced by the combustion of coal, petroleum and natural gas.
The scale of the imminent increases is illustrated by a United Nations projection that the amount of electricity produced in the world's coal burning power plants will double between 2002 and 2030.
Robert H. Socolow of Princeton University has calculated that the pollution produced by these plants during those 28 years will include approximately 501 billion tons of CO2.
That's almost as much CO2 as scientists believe coal burning has vented into the air since the turn of the 17th century, the time of William Shakespeare.
"If we're going to build that many coal plants, we're going to make one hell of an impact on the planet," Socolow said.
"I think it's obvious that a substantial fraction of that carbon dioxide should not be allowed to enter the atmosphere."
Socolow and ecologist Stephen Pacala, co directors of the Princeton Carbon Mitigation Initiative, say the world must move rapidly to develop a combination of strategies, from the use of carbon free alternative energies to the capture and storage of CO2, in order to reduce the buildup of greenhouse gases.
Removing CO2 from power plant emissions is not as difficult as it might sound.
About 15 percent of the flue gas from a traditional coal fired power plant is carbon dioxide, Socolow said.
If droplets of chemicals known as amines are sprayed through the flue gas in a chamber known as an absorption tower, the CO2 will stick to the amines, he said.
Then, under heat, the amine CO2 combination breaks apart, freeing the amine chemical to be routed back into the absorption tower to collect more CO2.
The next step, Socolow said, is to compress the CO2 into what's called a "supercritical" fluid, almost as dense as water.
Socolow said a 1000 megawatt coal plant would produce about 50 million barrels of supercritical carbon dioxide per year.
Several ways of storing the captured gas are being explored.
In one strategy, being explored by physicist Andrew Chizmeshya and chemist Michael McKelvy at Arizona State University, the supercritical CO2 would be combined with abundant surface rocks to form permanent carbonate compounds.
If a common rock called serpentine is ground and mixed with water and supercritical CO2 in a solution Chizmeshya likens to "dirty soda pop," the CO2 combines with the serpentine to form magnesium carbonate, or magnesite, he said.
The mineral is stable for millions of years.
The procedure would add $200 to the cost of using a ton of coal, but Chizmeshya said this is dramatically below the estimated cost when they started working on the system five years ago.
He and McKelvy said they believe they have the solution to a problem that could lower the cost even more.
The alternative approach of injecting the captured CO2 underground would not be a totally new technology.
In fact, the energy industry now injects compressed carbon dioxide into the ground to pressurize oil or gas reserves and make it easier to get the fuel out of the ground.
Also, Norway uses a deep below ground disposal system for carbon dioxide removed from natural gas in a purification step.
Socolow said new technologies like carbon dioxide storage, sometimes called carbon sequestration, will not work unless society decides to put a price on simply venting the gas into the atmosphere.
"Investment in technology is, I think, necessary, but there will be no actual the large scale implementation of the technology until it is cheaper to put it underground than to pay the tax to emit it," he said.
That would imply caps on emissions or a carbon tax, both of which have been non starters with the Bush administration.
However, Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman recently announced that the government would spend $100 million on moving "sequestration technology from the laboratory to the field."
He said that would bring the country "a step closer to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining the important role coal plays in America's energy mix."
Socolow said experts have calculated that the cost of pumping the gas into deep caverns would be about $25 a ton, or about $60 for every ton of coal.
By the time the cost is passed through the coal and power industries to the consumer, the cost of a kilowatt hour of electric power would probably go up 20 percent, or $40 on a $200 monthly home power bill, he said.
But that's too much, said Paul N. Cicio, executive director of the Industrial Energy Consumers of America.
"If my members' energy cost goes up 20 percent, they're out of business," he said.
He says his industry supports Bush administration initiatives to develop new technologies and energy efficiencies, but costly CO2 capture and storage efforts will work only if competing economies such as China and India do likewise.
John Topping, founder of the Climate Institute, an environmental organization devoted solely to climate change issues, agreed with Socolow and Pacala that a combination of strategies is urgently needed.
"We need to find ways to make renewable fuels and nuclear power more competitive, and to get these coal plants to start sequestering CO2, and to develop a clean hydrogen fuel system and do a lot of other things," he said.
"It may be a little bit here and a little bit there, but if something is not done soon, we're just going to be piddling into the wind," he added.

Less than a decade ago, the idea of capturing and storing the carbon gases blamed for driving the Earth towards climate change peril was usually dismissed with a laugh.
But a top scientific forum here shows how far the argument for carbon sequestration has come, with a series of experts insisting it can be transformed from fiction to fact.
Driving their case is the fear that time is running out for dealing cheaply with the carbon pollution spewed out by fossil fuels.
These emissions trap the Sun's heat and disrupt Earth's fragile climate system, with potentially catastrophic effects a few decades from now.
Their focus is on power stations which burn oil, gas and coal, and whose pollution is set to soar in coming years as China and India, the two world's most populous countries, meet surging needs for energy.
Sequestrators say carbon dioxide (CO2) would be captured using solvents, either before or after the fossil fuel is burned in the plant.
The CO2 would then be pumped out, sometimes over hundreds of kilometers (miles), to disused oil and gas fields up to one kilometer (3250 feet) underground, and stored.
It would not be the miracle cure to global warming or switch off the dependence on fossil fuels that are the source of the problem, they admit.
Even so, "it can play a global role, making very large and very rapid reductions of CO2 emissions," Jon Gibbins of Imperial College London said on Thursday.
He pointed to a pilot scheme in the North Sea as proof of its feasibility.
An experiment in Norway's offshore field, Sleipner, has been storing a million tonnes of waste CO2 per year since 1996, pumping it 1000 metres (3250 feet) below a cap of shale and mudstone.
Another project is in North America, where CO2 is being extracted from a coalgas plant in Wyoming and pumped 300 kms (185 miles) to Weyburn, in Canada's Saskatchewan province, where it is stored in an empty underground chamber in a working oilfield.
Environmentalists say the answer to global warming is to slash emissions themselves and swiftly wean the world off dirty fossils and onto renewable sources and hydrogen.
They also warn that the stored carbon is simply a bequeathed hazard for future generations.
If the geological storage tank leaks or is breached by an earthquake the outpouring of CO2 would instantly damage the world's climate system.
Gibbins says former oil and gas fields in sedimentary basins, but also many types of water aquifers, are excellent options for safe storage: "We are looking at 90 percent retention of the gas for 1000 years."
Taking out the CO2 from fuel is called "carbon neutral," in other words not adding further to emissions from that source.
But a more ambitious possibility is "carbon negative," or removing CO2 from the atmosphere.
That could be done by biofuels, suggests Peter Read, a professor at Massey University in New Zealand.
Plants suck CO2 out of the air as part of photosynthesis.
By growing plants, burning them in fossil fuel power stations and then sequestrating and storing the carbon, a dent could be made on ors would increase by 62 percent.
During the same period, world electricity demand is projected to double, with fossil fuels supplying most of the need.
The three day conference, ending in this southwestern city on Thursday, focussed on scientists' latest assessment of the global warming problem.
EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs on Wednesday called on oil companies to do more to boost refining capacity.
Piebalgs said he would meet with executives from major oil companies and ask them to do more to remove production bottlenecks.
"I consider it very important that oil companies behave in the most responsible manner given this situation," he told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, adding that the European Commission will strengthen dialogue with oil producing countries, including OPEC.
Europe pays higher prices for oil because it has less refining capacity than the United States.
Several U.S. refineries in the U.S. Gulf have yet to restart work after suffering storm damage from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Piebalgs reiterated Europe should switch to using alternative energy sources and boost research of wind, wave and solar, and hydrogen energy and of clean coal and carbon sequestration.
"The energy potential of biomass in the EU needs to be developed.
A Biomass Action Plan will be tabled before the end of the year," he said.
MEPs warned against the EU's over dependence on oil and said Europeans should diversify their energy sources.
"We face structural problems which go far beyond any short term crisis, said Fiona Jane Hall, a Liberal Democrat.
In a resolution scheduled to be voted on Thursday, lawmakers were to call on EU governments to initiate a world summit of large consumer and producer countries.
The resolution also calls on the European Commission to ensure the EU becomes the world's least fossil fuel dependent and most energy efficient economy by 2020.
Current EU president Britain aims to win an agreement on a new Europe wide law designed to reduce energy consumption before the end of this year.
Addressing the assembly, Britain's Europe Minister Douglas Alexander said reaching an agreement on the law had grown in importance as oil prices are at record levels.
The new regulation would require EU governments to save at least one percent more energy a year by promoting savings in the supply and distribution of electricity, gas, heating and fuels to households, transport and other industrial consumers.
"Promoting energy efficiency is quite rightly at the top of the agenda," Alexander told the Parliament.
The legislation must be approved by the European Parliaments and EU governments before it can become law.
EU energy ministers are due to hold their next meeting in Luxembourg on Oct 6.
The European Parliament will hold its next plenary session in mid October.
"We hope that the institutions will secure what is an important directive," Alexander said.
Existing technology should be used to capture and store carbon dioxide underground to prevent emissions and curb global warming, experts suggested in a comprehensive report released by the United Nations.
The document, prepared by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and released Monday, recommends using existing and emerging technologies for capturing the carbon dioxide produced by power plants and factories before it enters the atmosphere.
Carbon dioxide is one of the gases believed to cause the so called greenhouse effect, which is warming the earth's atmosphere and is widely believed to be the cause of the planet's increasingly bizarre weather patterns.
"While the most important solutions to climate change will remain energy efficiency and cleaner energy sources, this new report demonstrates that capturing and storing carbon dioxide can supplement these other efforts," said Klaus Topfer, executive director of United Nations Environment Program.
The report suggests emissions should be captured from sources such as electricity generation, refineries and oil plants, compressed and stored in geological formations, the oceans or in minerals, instead of being released in the atmosphere.
Such practices could lower the cost of mitigating climate change by one third over the next century and potentially account for half of emissions reductions needed between now and 2100 to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.
Storage of carbon dioxide underground could use much of the technology already developed by the oil and gas industry and become increasingly economical with technological advances, the report said.
The report estimates the risks associated with underground storage are similar to current practices of storing natural gas and that 99 percent of properly stored carbon dioxide would not leak during the next 1000 years.
The 650 page report is considered the most comprehensive on the subject and was written by some 100 experts from 32 countries.
According to the IPCC, emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could raise global average temperatures by up to 1.4 to 5.8 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.
They will continue to affect weather patterns, water resources, ecosystems and extreme climate events.
Scientists already have detected many early signs of global warming, including the shrinking of glaciers and Arctic sea ice, longer summers, changes in the migratory patterns of birds and the spread of many insects and plants toward the poles.
The IPCC report comes ahead of the first meeting in November of all signatories of the Kyoto Protocol since the treaty took effect this year.
The Protocol, an international treaty on climate change, caps the amount of carbon dioxide that power plants and fuel intensive manufacturers in more than two dozen countries are allowed to emit.
The United States, which accounts for one fourth of the world's greenhouse gases, has refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, saying it would harm the U.S. economy by raising energy prices and eliminating some 5 million jobs.
New industrial technologies and novel financial ideas can help the fight against global warming by cutting greenhouse gas emissions, according to scientists and climate experts gathered here by the World Bank.
Among new technologies, "carbon capture and sequestration" made more converts, and trading in carbon emissions rights on financial markets got an encouraging boost at the meeting.
Some scientists proposed a new concept of bringing together all the different methods of cutting greenhouse gases so that important progress made in each individual sector can contribute to worldwide climate stabilization.
"Do we have to wait for new technologies or do we have the technlogies today to address climate change?"
World Bank Chief Scientist and Senior Advisor Robert Watson asked on opening the energy conference here Monday.
The United States, which has refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol on global greenhouse gas emissions, put much stock in new technologies to cut heat trapping pollution.
But the Kyoto signataries are skeptical that technology alone can do the trick as they go ahead with their commitment to slash total greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 to five percent below the level they were in 1990.
"Countries that have decided to go down the road of technologies must have the responsability to tell the world if it is working or not," Netherlands Minister for Development Cooperation Agnes Van Ardenne told the meeting.
Carbon capture and sequestration was showcased as a promising technology by Robert Socolow, a Princeton University energy and environment expert.
Tests run in Norway and Algeria were promising, he said, and BP was about to announce a major carbon capture project in California.
The technique consists of capturing carbon gas emissions from power companies and injecting them in porous sediments beneath the ocean bottom where they can remain "sequestered" for thousands of years.
It is part of Socolow's theory of "stabilization wedges," which takes its name from the triangular shaped metal used to break wood into smaller pieces.
It defines sectors where the biggest efforts should be made to make a difference in the fight against global warming.
Published in Science Magazine in August 2004, Socolow's theory aims at solving global climate problems in 50 years by using existing technologies.
The wedges are the development of renewable sources of energy in 15 sectors including, new propulsion systems for vehicles, carbon sequestration, nuclear energy, biomass and the environment.
According to Socolow, if significant progress is made in seven of the 15 sectors, worldwide carbon dioxide levels in 2055 can be the same as in 2005.
In the financial world, the development of markets for trading in pollution rights is increasingly being used as an environmental policy tool for pollution control.
Currently installed in Chicago, Illinois, London and soon in Canada, the pollution rights market allows firms and investors to trade the right to emit specific pollutants the same as stocks.
The tonne of carbon at present is valued at around 100 dollars.
European governments, which have signed the Kyoto Protocol, are more active on the pollution rights markets than the United States.
But several US companies such as Ford, International Paper, IBM, American Electric Power, as well as cities and state governments such as New Mexico have also begun trading on the new markets.
Oil companies Statoil ASA and Royal Dutch Shell PLC announced a joint project Wednesday to cut pollution by using carbon dioxide from power plants to enhance oil recovery.
The companies said they want to capture carbon dioxide, a heat trapping, greenhouse gas, from natural gas electricity production and inject it into offshore fields so more oil can be recovered.
"The project consists of a gas fired power plant and methanol production facility at Tjeldbergodden in mid Norway, providing CO2 to the Draugen and Heidrun offshore oil and gas fields," the companies said in a statement.
At a news conference, Statoil Chief Executive Helge Lund said the project was in an early phase, and it was not clear when the companies would decide whether to go ahead.
"There are many pieces that must fall into place before a decision to invest," he said.
Norway is the world's third largest oil exporter, after Saudi Arabia and Russia, and also exports vast amounts of natural gas from its offshore fields.
However, the Nordic country has traditionally produced most of its own electricity from clean hydroelectric plants, and using natural gas generation at home has met stiff opposition because it would increase pollution.
Statoil and Shell now want to develop a system for using natural gas to produce power in Norway, scrub and capture the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and use it to maintain pressure in offshore oil reservoirs, boosting crude recovery.
The companies said the project would be the world's largest effort to use carbon dioxide to enhance oil recovery, with up to 2.5 million tons (2.8 million U.S. tons) of the gas injected into the fields per year.
That is roughly the emissions from 1 million automobiles, or about 5 percent of Norway's total CO2 emissions.
"This is an important milestone for Shell towards our vision for greener fossil fuels with part of the carbon dioxide captured and sequestrated underground," said Shell's Chief Executive Officer Jeroen van der Veer.
The project also calls for laying electricity cables from the land based power plant to the platform, further cutting pollution by reducing the need to burn petroleum offshore to produce the electricity the installations need.
Lund, of Statoil, said the project aims to meet several of the challenges facing world society, including cutting pollution while increasing electricity and oil supplies.
The project won immediate praise from environmental groups, which had adamantly opposed construction of natural gas power plants in Norway.
"This is the best news I have had in a long time.
We have worked for this for years," said Frederic Hauge, leader of the Norwegian environmental group Bellona.
Thomas Palm, a carbon dioxide expert with the Norwegian environmental group Zero, said the project could increase oil recovery by at least 155 million barrels in its lifetime.
The US Energy Department (DOE) announced Tuesday that an experimental project in Canada to inject carbon dioxide into oil fields for its permanent storage in geologic formations proved to be successful.
The test removed 5 million tons of the Earth's leading greenhouse gas, while raising the daily crude output of the Weyburn oil field in Saskatchewan, Canada, by 10000 barrels, said a DOE statement.
If the methodology could be applied worldwide, one third to one half of the carbon dioxide emissions to be released into the atmosphere could be eliminated over the next century, and billions of barrels of additional oil could be recovered, the department said.
Greenhouse gases can trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming if their emissions continue without being limited.
The Weyburn Project is a joint effort by the US Energy Department, the Canadian government and private industry.
Carbon dioxide comes from the Great Plains Synfuels plant in Beulah, N.D., where it is a byproduct from coal gasification.
"The success of the Weyburn Project could have incredible implications on reducing CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions and increasing America's oil production," said Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman in a statement released by his office.
Bodman is visiting the Middle East.
In the Weyburn Project, the carbon dioxide when pumped into the oil reservoir increased the pressure and brought more oil to the surface.
The technology can raise oil recovery by up to 60 percent, and extend the life of oil fields by decades as well.
The technology can also provide a permanent repository for the carbon dioxide in geologic formations, the DOE added.
The next phase of the Weyburn Project is expected to focus on improving injection efficiency and the process of refining.
The European Commission called on EU nations Tuesday to back a Danish pilot project meant to boost the use of cleaner energy sources.
It said the start of a new pilot energy plant at the Elsam power station near Esjberg, Denmark, expected on Wednesday, offered a way ahead in the search for near zero carbon dioxide emissions, in efforts to stem global warming.
EU spokeswoman Antonia Mochan said the project received euro8.5 million (US$10 million) in EU research funding to get it off the ground.
The project foresees the first use of new technology to capture carbon emitted from the conventional power plant and store it underground.
The technology can be used on coal and oil power plants and can also be used in oil refineries.
The plant at Elsam will be the first to test the new technology, the EU said.
"By developing technologies for carbon capture and storage, we can reduce emissions in the medium term as we move to large scale use of renewable, carbon free energy sources," said EU Research Commissioner Janez Potocnik in a statement.
The EU said it hoped to use the project to ensure the 25 nation bloc meets its international commitments to reduce carbon emissions.
The EU and China signed an agreement last month to encourage the development of cleaner coal fired power plants, also with the new technology to capture carbon dioxide emitted from coal burning plants.
China is heavily dependent on coal, which accounts for 70 percent of its energy consumption.
In the EU, fossil fuels account for around 85 percent.
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney's office reopened discussions Wednesday with eight other states that are trying to forge a landmark emission reduction plan for power plants, but it was unclear if any compromise might be reached.
Seven of those states decided last week to move forward without Massachusetts because of Romney's reluctance to act on the greenhouse gas pact, or to detail his concerns with it.
Rhode Island has also wavered on signing the pact.
But Wednesday, after Romney held a press conference to announce an emission plan for the state's dirtiest power plants, he indicated that Massachusetts could join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative pact if it incorporated a key piece of the state plan.
An e mail message scheduled to go out to the other states by Wednesday night.
Romney has raised concerns over the potential cost to businesses of the multistate program.
Last week, Romney suggested a price cap, but not give details.
"Anytime you negotiate you have to make sure you let people know that if you don't get things that are satisfactory, you won't sign on," Romney said.
"And so we will have a negotiation."
The new state plan, which was announced Wednesday, would be the first in the country to require power plants to limit emissions of carbon dioxide.
The plan, which takes effect next month, places a cap plants' payments exceeding carbon dioxide levels the state sets for each plant.
The limits target the state's six oldest and most power plants.
The Massachusetts plan places a limit on how much pollution each plant could emit.
Because those limits are lower than what the plants currently emit, the owners would have to reduce carbon dioxide or fund other carbon dioxide reductions elsewhere.
For example, companies could plant trees that absorb carbon dioxide, to offset excess emissions.
Those investments would have to take place in the Northeast.
If the cost to a Massachusetts plant reaches $6.50 to offset a ton of carbon dioxide emissions for 12 consecutive months, the plant could shop for reductions worldwide.
Environmentalists are critical of the plan, saying it will allow power plants to pollute at a set price rather than lower carbon dioxide emissions.
New York state officials, who first proposed the regional pact, said they have not yet reviewed details of Romney's state plan.
But they indicated that if Romney's proposal is anything like what he announced in the press conference Wednesday, it would not reduce carbon dioxide emissions enough and would be rejected.
"Massachusetts has decided to pursue a ,plan that will impose new taxes, but fail to ,reduce emissions," said Peter Constantakes, an aide to Governor George S. Pataki, a Republican.

Subsidiaries of BP and Edison International said Friday that they were planning to build a power plant that would run on oil residues, and that 90 percent of the carbon dioxide would be captured and pumped into an oilfield, where it would help push more oil to the surface.
The $1 billion plant would be adjacent to a BP refinery in Carson, Calif., about 20 miles south of Los Angeles, and would be the first of its kind in the country, the companies said.
BP is already drawing up engineering plans for a plant in Scotland that would sequester its carbon dioxide in an underground oil bearing formation, that plant is to run on natural gas.
The companies said they hoped to make a final decision on the plant in 2008 and have it running in 2011.
It would qualify for a tax credit as a carbon free energy source under the 2005 energy bill, company executives said.
The plant would run by mixing an oil residue, petroleum coke, in a chamber with steam and a controlled amount of oxygen.
In this technique, called gasification, both the fuel and the water give up hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen gas.
This process also produces carbon monoxide, which is converted to carbon dioxide, giving off heat to sustain the reaction.
The hydrogen is then burned in a turbine engine, the kind that electric companies normally run on natural gas, and the dominant combustion product is water.
The carbon dioxide is compressed into a liquid and injected into an oilfield.
Although the fuel is an oil residue, and not coal, the technology is the same as one mentioned by President Bush in his State of the Union speech on Jan 31, in which he said, "we will invest more in zero emission coal fired plants."
When coal or other fuels are gasified, conventional pollutants like sulfur and carbon dioxide, which is believed to be responsible for climate change, can be removed before combustion, while the volume of gas is still relatively small.
Petroleum coke from the Carson refinery is usually trucked to the harbor and shipped to China, where it is burned for fuel.
As a nearly carbon free source of electricity, the plant would compete with wind power.
Its construction cost is about double the cost of a wind turbine, according to Theodore F. Craver Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Edison Mission Energy, an unregulated subsidiary of Edison International.
But the production of wind turbines cannot be scheduled, and they generally produce only about 30 percent as much electricity as they would by running around the clock, this plant will run 90 to 95 percent of the hours in a year, he said.
And the Los Angeles Basin, where it is located, is often short of power, he said.
Steve Westwell, chief executive of BP Alternative Energy, said that all of the technologies had already been demonstrated individually, including separating carbon dioxide from hydrogen, and pumping the carbon dioxide under pressure into the ground.
One area in which the project would stretch existing technologies is in the turbine, hydrogen burns hotter than natural gas, and tends to make turbine blades brittle.
BP is seeking to put the carbon dioxide in oilfields owned by Occidental Petroleum.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who attended the project announcement, said, "This will be the first plant of its kind in the whole country, and I think it is a perfect fit for our state."
BP PLC said Monday it will increase its investment in alternative energy projects through a new business unit, BP Alternative Energy.
BP, which is based in Britain, said it expects to invest up to $8 billion (euro6.8 billion) in solar, wind, hydrogen and carbon abatement technology over ten years.
The investment represents only fraction of BP's annual $14 billion (euro12 billion) to $16 billion (euro13.6 billion) in capital expenditures but is an eightfold increase from the $1 billion (euro850 million) spent over the past decade, Chief Executive John Browne told a press conference.
The company plans to double its solar capacity from the roughly 100 megawatts of capacity it currently has in the United States, Spain, India and Australia.
Browne said BP was also planning a carbon sequestration project for 2006 and 2007, in which carbon emissions from power plants would be re injected in fallow offshore gas and oil fields.
Browne said BP looked to hire "several hundred" staff, including engineers, to support its new alternative and renewable energy investment plan, which is among the biggest by an oil major.
Browne said he expects the unit to achieve a 15 percent return on capital.
Friends of the Earth, an environmental organization, welcomed BP's "modest" shift of emphasis to focus more on alternative energy sources.
American Depositary Receipts of BP fell $1.72, or 2.5 percent, to close at $66.11 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Experts from around the world gathered in Paris Tuesday for a UNESCO conference on oceans, coasts and islands where the focus will be on stemming the erosion of biodiversity and the depletion of fish stocks, the UN's science and education body said.
"The experts will examine progress made in achieving the objectives set by the international community ,to improve conservation and management of the marine environment that makes up 72 percent of the surface of our planet," according to a press release.
Seventy eight countries are represented in the week long conference, including 21 small island developing states (SIDS), which are heavily dependent on the sea for economic development.
UNESCO said the conference would also tackle questions of governance and climate change.
"High seas governance is particularly important as 64 percent of the worlds oceans lie beyond the limits of national jurisdictions and are subject to considerable stress, notably due to fishing," UNESCO said.
"The debate on oceans and climate will focus on the problems of acidification, carbon dioxide sequestration and Arctic change.
"Climate change is expected to emerge as a major cause for the loss of biodiversity by the end of the century and to increase the vulnerability of coastal communities through erosion and flooding," it said.
The marshal yelled "God Save the United States and this honorable court" and the U.S. Supreme Court justices took their seats in a room bearing a sculpted depiction of Moses holding a Ten Commandments tablet.
That backdrop became part of the questioning Wednesday as the justices considered the ways in which government and religion intertwine during oral arguments in two closely watched cases from Texas and Kentucky.
Their ruling, due by the end of June, is expected to clarify when government may acknowledge religion and more specifically, under what circumstances it can display the Ten Commandments.
One of the cases originated when Thomas Van Orden, a homeless former lawyer, sued Texas officials in 2001, claiming that a Ten Commandments monument near the rear entrance to the state Capitol violated the constitutional separation between church and state.
He lost at trial and then on appeal and the monument remains.
His lawyer, Duke University Law Professor Erwin Chemerinsky, was the first to field questions from the justices.
"What happens if (the Ten Commandments) are packaged in a museum like setting?" asked Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, echoing an argument by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott that the monument is one of many on the grounds that shows different influences on Texas culture.
"This isn't a museum like setting," Chemerinsky said, dismissing Abbott's argument with one one of his own that the monument is in a uniquely prominent place on the Capitol grounds, away from any other display.
"Doesn't the venue count?" asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, noting that there is a difference between prayer in schools which the court has struck down and a prayer to open a legislative session, which the court has allowed.
Chemerinsky agreed, saying that "monument standing alone does convey the government's endorsement for religion."
Justice Anthony Kennedy said he would be worried that any ruling by the court that showed "obsessive concern with any message of religion" would suggest a "hostility towards religion."
"This is a classic avert your eyes," Kennedy said.
"If an atheist walks by he can avert his eyes."
"I don't think so, your honor," Chemerinsky said, arguing that the message conveyed by the monument is that the Texas government favors Judeo Christian religions above others.
That, Chemerinsky said, would be a violation of the Establishment Clause, the part of the First Amendment that says "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion."
After Chemerinsky sat down, Abbott argued that the Ten Commandments are a historically recognized "symbol of law" that are part of an integrated display erected to honor a service organization's work with juveniles.
The monument, he added, has stood for 40 years unchallenged before Van Orden brought his case.
The Supreme Court decided to hear the Texas and Kentucky cases amid a national debate on religion's role in government.
Ten Commandments displays that have stood for decades in and near courthouses and other public buildings across the country have come under frequent attack by people and groups saying they violate the Constitution.
Defenders of the Ten Commandments displays, including the Bush Administration, say the religious text has been important in developing the country's legal and civic traditions.
In the Kentucky case, two counties posted framed copies of the Ten Commandments on the walls of two different courthouses.
They later added other documents, including copies of the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence.
An appeals court ordered those Ten Commandments displays removed.
Lower courts have issued conflicting rulings in dozens of cases involving Ten Commandments displays in recent years.
Those include a 2003 Alabama case that led Chief Justice Roy Moore to be removed from office for refusing to comply with a court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the state judicial building.
Moore supporters were among several hundred people who assembled Wednesday morning outside the nation's highest court as temperatures hovered around freezing with a stiff wind that made it feel ten degrees cooler.
"The Ten Commandments is part of our history, it's a Christian history," said Rod McDougal of San Diego, a Moore supporter who has been traveling with the monument removed from the Alabama court building.
Chris Clipper, a former Austinite who moved to a Washington suburb last year, paced the sidewalk as crowds lined up for the few public seats in the white columned Supreme Court building, carrying a sign proclaiming himself an atheist.
"I think there should be a public forum where all views should be heard, respected," said Clipper, 41.
Inside the courtroom, Justice Antonin Scalia joined Kennedy in signaling clear support of the government's right to acknowledge religion.
Scalia suggested during Chemerinsky's argument that there is no difference between referencing God at the opening of Supreme Court hearings and erecting a Ten Commandments monument.
"I think 90 percent (of Americans) believe in the Ten Commandments and I think 85 percent can't tell you what they are," Scalia said, drawing laughs from people in the packed chamber.
"It's a symbol that government derives its authority from God."
Chemerinsky countered that while the inclusion of "God" in a prayer may be a symbol, displaying a religious text like the Ten Commandments conveys a "profound religious message."
As for the depiction of Moses who Christians believe received the Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai on a frieze on a wall to the left of the justices inside the Supreme Court chambers.
Chemerinsky said it is constitutional because it is included in a display of 15 "great lawgivers."
The Texas monument would be constitutional if it were displayed similarly.
When it was Abbott's turn, Justice John Paul Stevens asked him whether he would consider a crucifix of the same size and shape on the Capitol grounds constitutionally acceptable.
Probably not, Abbott said, because it is "not a historically recognized symbol of law ,and does not send a message to all people."
Abbott fielded several questions about his legal argument that the Ten Commandments are secular.
"You are asking us to ignore the religious purpose?"
Kennedy asked.
There is both a secular and a religious interpretation of the commandments, Abbott said.
O'Connor, widely believed to be the swing vote in the case, asked how the state could erect a monument on state grounds and purport to not endorse its message.
"Every monument on the Capitol grounds enjoys a state endorsement, doesn't it?" she asked.
Abbott replied that only nine of 17 monuments bear the state seal.
The Ten Commandments monument does not, he said.
Later, Acting U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement who spoke on behalf of the Bush Administration echoed Abbott's claims.
"The Ten Commandments have undeniable religious significance," he said.
"But they also have secular significance as a code of law."

WASHINGTON The Supreme Court Wednesday wrestled with whether the Constitution allows displays of the Ten Commandments on government property, bringing to a climax the latest battle in the culture war over the role of Christianity in the nation's public life and the exact line between church and state.
Lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union and a Texas plaintiff argued that the Ten Commandments presuppose the existence of a God.
Although the tablets can be displayed on government property in a secular context, they said, displays in Texas and Kentucky went too far, violating the First Amendment's prohibition on establishing an official state religion.
But supporters of the displays argued that the Ten Commandments serve a secular historic function as well as a religious one.
They said the displays should be allowed to stay on the Texas state capitol grounds and in a Kentucky county courthouse.
The arguments signaled little chance that the perennially contentious issue will be definitively resolved.
The justices showed no appetite for creating a clear rule that state exhibits of the Ten Commandments will henceforth either always be allowed or always be forbidden.
Instead, the arguments revolved around which legal doctrine should be used to decide on a case by case basis, how the details of the two cases before the court fit those tests, and whether those tests should be kept or modified.
"Because of our religious traditions, there's no way to do it other than to look at divisive qualities on a case by case basis," said Justice Stephen G. Breyer said.
"When I do that, I don't find divisiveness here."
Not so, responded Erwin Chemerinsky, a lawyer arguing against the Texas display.
He noted that the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court lost his job in 2003 for defying a federal order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from his state courthouse.
"The Ten Commandments is enormously divisive today," he said.
He also noted the hundreds of evangelical Christian protesters praying outside the Supreme Court walls and said he had received hate messages in the past week.
The Texas case involves a Ten Commandments monument on the capitol grounds that was donated to the state four decades ago.
The only one of 17 monuments on the grounds that has a religious theme, it was formally endorsed by the Legislature.
The Kentucky case involves a recent effort to exhibit the Ten Commandments in a county courthouse as part of a "Foundations Display" along with political and patriotic texts that are not religious in nature.
The first version contained only the commandments, and a second added excerpts from speeches and public documents that made specific reference to Christianity.
The display in dispute, the third version, dropped the Christian references and added such documents as the Magna Carta.
The courthouse changed the display in response to a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union.
A judge ruled that the new display was unconstitutional, because the history showed that officials' clear intent was to post a religious document.
The counties asked the Supreme Court for a new test that looks at the effects of the display, not the intent of its sponsors.
The dispute also had personal overtones for the Supreme Court.
Its courtroom is replete with Ten Commandments imagery, from a frieze that includes Moses holding the tablets to several images of twin tablets with Roman numbers from 1 to 10.
Lawyers challenging the constitutionality of the Texas and Kentucky displays showed no desire to confront the high court about its own use of the iconography.
They said the Supreme Court's use of the image was obviously of a secular nature, to acknowledge one source of law among many, while insisting that the Texas and Kentucky displays went too far.
Nevertheless, the Supreme Court's use of commandments imagery was a regular theme.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg pointed to the frieze on the south wall of the courtroom, which depicts Moses with eight other ancient lawgivers.
The tablets of Moses are tilted so only the second five commandments, all secular rules, such as "Thou shalt not kill," are visible.
Religious rules, such as "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain," are hidden.
Ginsberg asked whether an inscription of the secular rules without the tablets would be acceptable on government property.
Chemerinsky said they would be since those rules are also found in Texas statutes.
That led Justice Antonin Scalia to interrupt with a scoff: "Who are you kidding?
Everyone knows these come from the Ten Commandments."
Scalia, a devout Catholic, also took issue with the argument by Attorney General Greg Abbott of Texas that the display from that state serves a secular function.
Scalia denounced the idea of "watering down" the religious message of the Ten Commandments, which he said was "government derives its authority from God," and suggested that it would be a "Pyrrhic victory" if Texas won on those grounds.
Atheists should "turn your eyes away if it's such a big deal to you," he added.
The court's two swing voters, Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor, both appeared uneasy about the prospect of ordering governments to take down all of the thousands of Ten Commandments displays around the country.
Kennedy talked about "an obsessive concern with any mention of religion" that would amount to impermissible "hostility to religion."
O'Connor suggested that for older monuments and displays, the state's "interest in preserving old objects" in a "museumlike setting" could be an alternative justification for not tearing down Ten Commandments monuments.
The court last addressed the issue in a Kentucky case in 1980, striking down a state mandate that schools post copies of the commandments.

Win or lose, Thomas Van Orden savored the moment on Wednesday as the lawsuit he brought here three years ago was preoccupying the highest judges of the land in Washington.
"What are the chances of this case making it to the Supreme Court?" he asked from behind a borrowed computer at the University of Texas law library.
"My God!
My little case."
It is hardly little a constitutional challenge to displaying the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the Texas Capitol, and so, a case that could rewrite aspects of church state relations when the high court rules, perhaps this summer.
But at any point in its journey up the legal ladder, Van Orden said, it might have failed for the unlikeliest of reasons: a lack of paper, or postage.
Van Orden, a suspended lawyer who put his age at 60, compiled the case while homeless, living in a tent on a wooded tract in Austin, surviving on food stamps, while writing his briefs at the law library and scrounging for writing materials.
"You can find paper and pens on the college campus," he said.
"Just look down."
At times, he said, he lacked the 10 cents to print out even one page of his briefs and did not have the money to mail his appeal to the federal appeals court in New Orleans.
But he disdained what he portrayed as the caricaturing of his story by journalists.
"OK, so I did crawl in out of the woods," he said, "but I brought some knowledge with me."
It is not about him, Van Orden said again and again in an interview on Wednesday, deflecting personal questions while talking animatedly about the legal issues and yet volunteering intriguing snippets of biography that included a stint as a pilot.
"It's not my lawsuit," he said.
"It's every American's."
Van Orden said he had turned down an offer by a lawyer who argued his case, Erwin Chemerinsky, to pay for a trip to Washington to witness the argument.
"I don't think I should accept anyone's money to go," he said.
He also said that he had overcome an unspecified psychological problem, that he was eager for a steady job "You don't actually think I like living in a tent, do you?" and that he had gotten, and laughed off, offers from Hollywood for his story.
"How do you do a movie of a guy at his desk researching legal briefs?" he asked.
"There's no car chases, no exploding bombs."
But he said that if anyone persisted, "I would say, 'Bring cash and tell me what time to meet your plane."'
Tall, with lanky, center parted hair and a thick brush mustache Van Orden, who declined to be photographed as well said he had not gone looking for a cause.
"This one found me," he said.
He said he had come across the Ten Commandments monument on the Capitol grounds several years ago and, based on his readings of separation of powers cases thought: "Something ought to be done, and why not me?
So I did it."
He said he was drawn to the case not by any antipathy toward religion he was brought up Southern Baptist, he said but raised questions with a state preservation office and was told the display would not come down.
"I never said, 'I demand you take it down,"' Van Orden said.
"I'm not rude."
But he did begin researching a federal lawsuit that he filed in 2002.
"I was demonstrating what you could do with a pencil and paper and a law book," Van Orden said.
A graduate of Southern Methodist University's law school in Dallas, Van Orden said he had practiced criminal law in Houston, principally defending drug dealers, until "something happened to me" that he said "destroyed me."
Previously published articles said he fell prey to acute anxiety and did not complete some cases he had been engaged to handle, accounts he declined to discuss beyond saying, "I never stole a dime from anybody."
Texas State Bar records list him as suspended for "disciplinary sanctions" and "default in payment of Occupation Tax."
He said he had been divorced for 15 years and had a son and a daughter.
Little by little, other details of Van Orden's life emerged.
He said he had served in the Vietnam era Army and had narrowly avoided duty as a helicopter gunner by signing up as a lawyer in the judge advocate general's corps.
But he said his brother, a Navy pilot who served on the same aircraft carrier as Sen John McCain, was shot down and killed.
Van Orden said he himself later became a pilot flying light planes and training flight students and walked away from at least one serious crash.
He was always drawn to constitutional law, he said, and was so enamored of Benjamin Nathan Cardozo, the former Supreme Court justice, that he named his son after him.
In the Ten Commandments case, Van Orden said, the central questions were: What was the government's purpose in putting up the display in 1961, and what message did it send to people?
If religious, it was unacceptable, he said.
Moreover, he said, the version of the commandments at the Capitol omits part of the Hebrew text referring to God's covenant with the Jews, raising another religious issue, he said.
Van Orden lost in the district court and, after managing to pay for enough copies and postage, appealed to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, where he also lost.
Then, he said, seizing on conflicting opinions by different federal appeals courts, he asked the Supreme Court to resolve the issue.
"That's what the Supreme Court does for a living," he said.
Chemerinsky, a law professor at Duke University, said that after the high court agreed to hear the case in late 2003, Van Orden called him one of the rare times Van Orden used a telephone and the two agreed to collaborate.
Chemerinsky flew to Austin last November and with Van Orden walked the Capitol grounds, seeing the monument and discussing the case.
"He was extremely knowledgeable in the law in this case," Chemerinsky said.
They did not discuss Van Orden's homelessness, he said, adding, "It was none of my business."
They exchanged drafts by e mail, Van Orden working at the University of Texas law library and the state law library, using his own e mail accounts honoring his favorite Roman philosopher, Seneca.
Van Orden derided the cliches of homelessness that he said reporters had unfairly stuck to him over the years.
He did not travel with bundles, he said, and he took pride in his clean clothes and grooming, which he attended to in ways he did not detail.
"I'm surprised they don't have me trailing a yellow dog," he said, exaggerating.
He ate on food stamps at the upscale Central Market, pitched his tent nightly and took it down each morning in a wooded location he did not specify, traveled on a free bus pass granted for a veteran's disability and read newspapers and magazines free at newsstands.
He said his happiest moment was not when he heard the Supreme Court was taking his case but when his teenage daughter read the story and tracked him down by e mail, breaking a long estrangement.
The Supreme Court struggled Wednesday with the politically charged issue of whether prominent display of the Ten Commandments at government buildings violates separation of church and state.
In a Texas case, the court heard a challenge to a granite monument depicting the biblical Ten Commandments that sits near the entrance to the state Capitol in Austin.
A second case tests whether Kentucky judges went too far when they posted framed copies of the Ten Commandments on the walls of their county courthouse.
Defenders of the displays say they merely acknowledge the nation's religious heritage and the historical role of the Ten Commandments as a source of law and morality.
The challengers say the biblical commands show the government to be endorsing religion, a violation of the First Amendment's ban on an "establishment of religion."
The questions asked by the justices suggested they are headed for a split decision.
"It's so hard to draw the line," said Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the frequent centrist who is likely to draw the line in both cases.
State lawmakers may open their sessions with a prayer delivered by a chaplain, O'Connor noted, citing a past ruling that upheld this practice.
How then can it be unconstitutional to have a monument with Ten Commandments sitting outside the Capitol, she asked.
Because placing the Ten Commandments in front of the Capitol "conveys a powerful message" that the government itself "is endorsing religion," said Duke law professor Erwin Chemerinsky on behalf of Thomas Van Orden, a homeless Texas man who sued to have the monument removed.
"This is a sacred and solemn text.
These are God's words to God's followers."
To which Justice Antonin Scalia replied, in effect, what's wrong with that?
"It's a symbol that the government derives its authority from God," he said.
"That's what this is about.
Our laws are derived from God."
Scalia said he believed 90 percent of the American people supported having the Ten Commandments on display, even if "85 percent of them couldn't tell you what they say."
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said he too saw no problem with the display of the Ten Commandments.
He said he did not understand "this obsessive concern with anything religious."
Those who do not wish to see the Ten Commandments at the Capitol grounds "can avert their eyes."
Demands to remove the Ten Commandments show "hostility to religion," he added.
The justices heard two hours of argument, and they sounded closely split.
Four justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer support a distinct separation of church and state, and signaled they are likely to vote to strike down the religious displays in Texas and Kentucky.
When Mathew Staver, a lawyer representing the Kentucky judges, described the Ten Commandments as secular, not just religious, Ginsburg stopped him.
"Have you read the first four Commandments?" she asked.
They begin with the words, "I Am the Lord Thy God.
Thou shalt have no other gods before me."
Followers are also told not to have "any graven images," to "take the Name of the Lord Thy God in vain," and are reminded to keep the Sabbath Day holy.
Four others Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Clarence Thomas, Scalia and Kennedy have upheld religious displays and invocations at public buildings.
None of the lawyers took an all or nothing stand on the issue.
Chemerinsky, for example, said he saw no problem with a display in the courtroom where the justices met Wednesday high on the wall carved in marble is a depiction of Moses holding the stone tablets.
The marble frieze depicts "lawgivers" throughout history, from Hammurabi and Solomon to Napoleon and John Marshall, the fourth chief justice of the Supreme Court.
Lawyers on the opposite side of the case from Chemerinsky agreed that religious presentations by government could go too far.
Acting Solicitor General Paul Clement, arguing on behalf of the Bush administration, was asked about Alabama Justice Roy Moore, whose display of the Ten Commandments in the center of the state's Supreme Court building has been rejected by lower courts.
That "crosses a constitutional line," Clement replied.
Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott was asked whether the state could display a crucifix.
"I seriously question whether a crucifix would be acceptable," he said.
By contrast, the Ten Commandments are not just a religious symbol, he said.
They "are a historically recognized symbol of law," Abbott said.
(Optional add end) O'Connor could decide to split the difference on the issue by upholding the Ten Commandments in one case and striking them down in the other.
For example, she could vote to uphold the Texas monument because it sits among other statutes and monuments on the Capitol grounds at one point, she described it "as a park like setting."
However, she could also agree with her more liberal colleagues that the Kentucky judges went too far because they were determined to post the Ten Commandments so visitors would be all but obliged to read them.
She sharply questioned the lawyer in the Kentucky case because officials there said they were trying to "demonstrate America's Christian heritage" when they first posted the Ten Commandments five years ago.
The Supreme Court, including the ailing Rehnquist, will vote on the two cases behind closed doors later this week.
The justices will issue a written opinion by late June.
The justices of the Supreme Court appeared to wrestle with contradictory impulses as they heard arguments on Wednesday in two cases challenging government displays of the Ten Commandments.
On the one hand, they were searching for a broad principle that could decide not only these particular disputes, but future ones as well.
On the other hand, they appeared powerfully drawn to deciding the two cases on their specific facts, even at the risk of inviting an endless parade of future cases.
Was the 22 acre park surrounding the Texas Capitol, where a Ten Commandments monument sits among 16 other displays, all of them nonreligious, the equivalent of an outdoor museum or sculpture garden?
Fine: maybe just such a mixed display might pass constitutional muster, even if a stand alone Ten Commandments in a future case might prove more troublesome.
Did it matter that the two Kentucky courthouses now seeking to display a framed Ten Commandments surrounded by nine nonreligious historical documents had at first hung unadorned copies of the Commandments and did not add the other documents until after a lawsuit was filed?
If so, if that history provided the constitutional taint that led a federal appeals court to order removal of the entire displays, then the answer to whether a display without such a history would be acceptable could wait for another day.
By the end of two hours of argument, it was not clear how the justices would resolve the problem they created for themselves when, after 25 years of silence on the Ten Commandments, they agreed to decide these two cases.
Justice Antonin Scalia, unsurprisingly, expressed a definitive view, consistent with his long held position in religion cases.
He called the Ten Commandments "a symbol of the fact that government derives its authority from God," adding, "That seems to me an appropriate symbol to put on government grounds."
But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who may well be in a position to cast the deciding vote, appeared uncertain as she tried out various approaches to resolving the cases on narrow grounds.
Referring to the Texas monument, erected in 1961 by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, she wondered aloud whether "at some point" the preservation of an "old object" might itself provide an independent, nonreligious justification for keeping the Ten Commandments on the Capitol grounds.
The justices' visible struggle reflected the fact that the Supreme Court's own precedents provide relatively little guidance on how to tell the difference between religious displays that amount to an unconstitutional "establishment" of religion and those that acknowledge religion in such a minimal or contextual way that the Constitution is not offended, even if some individuals are.
In 1980, the court invalidated a Kentucky law that required the posting of the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom, but no one seemed to suggest that the old case, Stone v. Graham, provided an answer to the new ones.
In the new cases, one federal appeals court upheld the Texas display even as another struck down the two in Kentucky.
Would it be permissible for the Texas Legislature to post the Ten Commandments, not in an outdoor park, but in the halls of the Capitol, O'Connor asked Erwin Chemerinsky, who was representing the Austin man who challenged the Texas display.
No, replied Chemerinsky, a professor at Duke University Law School, because that would be a sign of government endorsement of religion.
But the Supreme Court itself has upheld the practice of beginning a legislative session with a prayer, O'Connor pointed out.
"It can't be that just because a prayer is permissible, everything becomes permissible," Chemerinsky replied, adding that a Legislature could not mount a large Latin cross on the top of a state Capitol.
"It's so hard to draw the line!"
O'Connor exclaimed.
Justice Stephen G. Breyer said he had reluctantly and tentatively come to the conclusion that there was no way for the court to decide religious display cases other than by evaluating the divisive nature of the display on a case by case basis.
The Ten Commandments are "enormously divisive," Chemerinsky responded, urging that the court "not ignore social reality."
He mentioned the crowds that the arguments themselves drew to the court, as well as the dispute in Alabama two years ago over Chief Justice Roy Moore's display of a large Ten Commandments monument in the courthouse rotunda.
Scalia asked whether the marshal's invocation that begins each Supreme Court session, "God save the United States and this honorable court," was not also "divisive, because there are people who don't believe in God."
Chemerinsky replied that it was important to draw a distinction between "minimal and maximum religious content."
The message of the Ten Commandments was deeply religious he said: "All of these are God's commands to his people."
Justice David H. Souter asked whether a tablet containing only the last five commandments, the injunctions against killing, stealing, and so on, might be constitutional because, unlike the first five, they did not necessarily imply religious belief.
That would be a harder case, Chemerinsky replied, but such a tablet would still be unconstitutional because it would still convey the Ten Commandments' message.
What about a "piece of stone" simply carved with the various "thou shalt nots," Souter asked.
That would be acceptable as a "reflection of law" rather than religion, Chemerinsky replied.
"Who are you kidding?"
Scalia broke in, adding that "everyone knows" that the reference would be to the Ten Commandments.
"Context matters enormously," Chemerinsky said.
Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, described the Ten Commandments as a "recognized symbol of law" and defended the state's display as having the secular purpose of "recognizing historic influences" on the legal system.
The attorney general's argument distressed Scalia.
"You're watering it down to say the only message is a secular message," the justice said.
"I can't agree with you.
'Our laws come from God.'
If you don't believe it sends that message, you're kidding yourself."
Later, Scalia told Abbott: "I would consider it a Pyrrhic victory for you to win on the grounds you're arguing."
In both the Texas case, Van Orden v. Perry, No. 03 1500, and the Kentucky case, McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union, No. 03 1693, the Bush administration argued on behalf of the displays.
"The Ten Commandments have an undeniable religious significance, but also a secular significance as a code of law and a well recognized symbol of law," Paul D. Clement, the acting solicitor general, told the justices.
He added: "The Establishment Clause should not be interpreted to force the state to send a message of hostility toward religion."
The question was one of degree, Clement suggested.
In answer to a question from Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, he said that Moore in Alabama "probably" crossed the constitutional line when he turned the courthouse rotunda into the equivalent of a "religious sanctuary."
Clement added: "The state can have a permissible acknowledgment of religion, and I don't think in this case the state of Texas has gone too far."
In defending the Kentucky courthouse displays, Mathew D. Staver, a lawyer with Liberty Counsel, a Florida based group associated with the Rev. Jerry Falwell, said the appeals court had "ignored the overall context" when it ordered the removal of courthouse displays that contained the Ten Commandments surrounded by the text of nine historic documents, including the Mayflower Compact.
But it was the context that the justices probed, several dwelling on the original 1999 displays that contained the Ten Commandments alone.
The two counties, McCreary and Pulaski, had decided to "switch rather than fight," Staver said, and should be "rewarded, not punished, for trying to get things right."
But "the courts cannot turn a blind eye to a sham secular purpose," David A. Friedman, general counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, told the justices.
He said a "reasonable observer" would know the history and understand the counties' real purpose.
A granite monument of the Ten Commandments outside the Texas Capitol amounts to an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion, a lawyer favoring a high wall between church and state told the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
Arguments in the Texas case and a similar one from Kentucky pose the question of whether and how the Ten Commandments can be displayed on government property.
Rulings in the cases could decide the shape of church state relations for decades to come.
The high court's decisions probably issued by the end of June could significantly raise or lower the wall separating government and religion.
In doing so, they could clarify decades of confusing, muddled jurisprudence on what constitutes government endorsement of religion.
In the Texas case, a homeless man filed suit challenging the constitutionality of a 6 foot by 3 foot monument in the shape of two tablets, inscribed with the Ten Commandments, two Stars of David and other symbols.
The 43 year old granite monument one of 38 on the Texas Capitol grounds in Austin was donated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles.
The tablets are located roughly 75 feet from the Capitol building and 123 feet from the state Supreme Court.
Opponents say that because the monument is on the Capitol grounds under the authority of the Texas legislature, it constitutes government endorsement of Christianity and in particular Protestant faiths, from which the display's Ten Commandments text is derived.
"Here you have a monument that claims not only is there a God, but God has dictated 10 rules for behavior," said Erwin Chemerinsky, a lawyer for the Texas man who wants the tablet removed.
"Imagine the Buddhist or Muslim who walks into the Supreme Court.
He will realize this is not his government."
But lawyers supporting the monument and other similar displays argued that the Ten Commandments are a historically recognized symbol of law.
And they noted that in a 1983 case, the Supreme Court found it was constitutional for a state legislature to begin its session with prayer.
"I don't see why one is good and the other is bad," said Justice Antonin Scalia.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, often a swing vote when the justices are closely divided, questioned how appropriate it would be if "the legislature itself wants to have the Ten Commandments displayed in its legislative halls."
When Chemerinsky said that would be unconstitutional, O'Connor complained "it's so hard to draw that line."
If legislatures can open their sessions with prayers, O'Connor wondered how displaying the Ten Commandments in the same hall could be unconstitutional.
The Kentucky case involves the constitutionality of Ten Commandments displays in two county courthouses.
The displays have been modified twice in response to lower court rulings against the exhibits.
The first ones consisted of a framed copy of the Ten Commandments.
In its current version, the Ten Commandments are surrounded by historic American and British political and patriotic documents.
A description in the final displays asserts the exhibits are of "documents that played a significant role in the foundation of our system of law and government."
Opponents of the Kentucky exhibits argue county officials clearly had a religious purpose in posting the Ten Commandments and that the subsequent modifications were little more than a "sham" designed to insulate the displays from scrutiny.
Justice David Souter said it seemed clear the displays were religious in nature.
"There's no reason the intent of this display has changed as the context has changed," Souter said.
But supporters argue the court should not give too much weight to the original intent of county officials in erecting the displays.
Kentucky authorities were only trying "to do the best they could" to follow previous court decisions, said Mathew Staver, who represented the Kentucky counties.
"They have got to be able to adjust their missteps whenever they step on a constitutional land mine that is blurry and confusing."
Acting Solicitor General Paul Clement, who represented the Bush administration in defending the Texas and Kentucky displays, said "municipalities should be rewarded, not punished, for trying to change the context to try and get it right."
During the arguments Wednesday, justices appeared to struggle with how to judge the Texas and Kentucky displays and whether a single test could be constructed to decide when government sponsored religious exhibits or actions run afoul of the Constitution.
Justice Stephen Breyer doubted the high court could fashion a one size fits all solution.
"We are a religious nation," Breyer said.
"I think the only way to do it is to look at the divisive quality of the display on a case by case basis."
Even as justices weighed the issue, they noted that religious symbols are displayed throughout the Supreme Court building.
Above the dais, a large frieze depicts Moses holding the Ten Commandments without text displayed.
Other historic lawgivers including Chinese philosopher Confucius, Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus, and former Chief Justice John Marshall also are depicted on the panel.
Supreme Court sessions also open with a clerk proclaiming: "God save the United States and this honorable court."

The Ten Commandments monument on the Texas Capitol grounds should remain because it is a cultural and historical symbol that does not violate the separation of church and state, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott told the U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday.
But an attorney representing Thomas Van Orden, an Austin, Texas, homeless lawyer challenging the law, countered that the 40 year old pink granite slab sends a "powerful religious message" and defies years of legal doctrine prohibiting a government endorsement of religion.
Justices peppered both sides with pointed questions as the court confronted church state cases that could affect the display of religious symbols at public sites across the country.
The justices also heard a challenge to Ten Commandments exhibits in Kentucky courthouses.
"I think 90 percent of Americans believe in the Ten Commandments," said Justice Antonin Scalia, "but 85 percent probably couldn't tell you what they are."
The cases constituted the first Ten Commandments dispute to come before the court in a quarter century and attracted dozens of third party participants, from atheists to religious groups.
Hundreds of protesters from at least a half dozen states mustered on the Supreme Court steps, often kneeling in impromptu prayer services.
More than a dozen onlookers, including out of town law students, spent the night in windy, freezing temperatures to get seats to the landmark arguments.
Protesters, bundled against the biting chill, displayed their sentiments with signs declaring, "Keep Church and State Separate" or "No Religious Test for Patriotism."
The challenge to the Texas monument drew an extra burst of attention because of the man who waged it Van Orden, a Southern Methodist University graduate who is no longer eligible to practice law.
He slept in an Austin park while spending his days in the Texas State Library preparing the case.
Van Orden, who filed his suit in 2002, was not present for the Supreme Court arguments, but his chief attorney, Duke University law school professor Erwin Chemerinsky, said he and Van Orden have stayed in touch through almost daily e mail exchanges.
Chemerinsky agreed to handle the case for free after Van Orden called and asked his help.
The Ten Commandments monument was donated to the Texas Legislature in 1961 by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a century old civic organization, to commemorate youth and denounce juvenile delinquency.
The monument is one of 17 memorials on the State Capitol grounds and sits halfway between the Capitol and the State Supreme Court building.
Abbott, making his first argument before the high court, contended that the Ten Commandments monument, while containing a sacred religious text, constitutes a cultural, historical and legal symbol by being clustered with a diverse array of other monuments.
He described the setting as an outdoor museum.
But Chemerinsky argued that the monument serves no secular purpose and "impermissibly" endorses religion.
The 51 year old law professor, acknowledging the emotional intensity of the issue, also told the justices that he has received hate mail because of his legal opposition to the Texas monument.
At issue is the Establishment Clause in the Constitution's First Amendment, prohibiting Congress from enacting any law establishing a government sanctioned religion.
The 10 word clause is the cornerstone of more than two centuries of legal doctrine on the separation of church and state.
Justices interrupted frequently as the hourlong argument veered into hypothetical discussions on whether other religious oriented expressions, such as an opening prayer before Congress or a Thanksgiving proclamation, would be banned under a strict interpretation of what constitutes religion.
They also noted that Moses and the Ten Commandments are part of a decorative historical carving along the ceiling of the Supreme Court chambers.
"I don't know why the one is good and the other is bad," said Scalia, contrasting the Ten Commandments monument with a congressional prayer.
During the subsequent arguments on the Kentucky case, Scalia said sardonically: "I don't know who we're addressing when we say, 'God Save this honorable court.'
" Justice Anthony Kennedy complained about "an obsessive concern to any mention of religion" on public sites.
"This is a classic 'avert your eyes,' " he said.
"If an atheist walks by, he can avert his eyes."
Justice John Paul Stevens raised the possibility of posting a disclaimer that the Ten Commandments and similar displays might have a religious connotation.
Abbott said a disclaimer might help fend off legal challenges but he later told reporters that he felt it would be unnecessary under Texas' argument that the Austin monument is non religious.
Abbott, who was partially paralyzed when he was struck by a falling tree while jogging two decades ago, made his arguments from his wheelchair.
Stevens told Abbott that his presentation demonstrated "that it's not necessary to stand at the lectern in order to do a fine job."
Ailing Chief Justice William Rehnquist was absent but Stevens, second in seniority, said Rehnquist "reserves the right" to participate in the decision.
Abbott, 47, a former state Supreme Court justice, declined to predict the outcome of the case but several attorneys on both sides of the issue said the justices' comments suggested that the court might support the state's arguments.
"In the Texas case, they seemed more inclined to find the display OK," said Steven Freeman of New York, an attorney with the Anti Defamation League, which supported Van Orden's challenge.

The US Supreme Court on Wednesday was to review the displaying in public spaces of the Ten Commandments, the fundamental moral precepts of Judeo Christian religions, in a case that could define the extent of separation of church and state in American society.
Following challenges to the use of public property for displaying the commandments in Texas and Kentucky, the court will decide under what conditions, if at all, such explicitly religious displays are permitted.
The first amendment to the US Constitution establishes the principle of separation of church and state, but the details of this principle remain unclear in the face of numerous contradictory decisions by courts over many decades.
Jews and Christians believe the Ten Commandments are the basic moral guidelines given to Moses directly by God on Mount Sinai.
The court will review, in the Kentucky case, the legality of displaying framed copies of the Ten Commandments in two courthouses among copies of other documents that form the basis of US laws.
The Texas case involves the legality of a stone monument inscribed with the commandments installed on the grounds of the state legislature.
Last October, the Supreme Court declined to review a third case, concerning the installation of a stone replica of the commandments in front of the state Supreme Court of Alabama.
The case has drawn extremely high interest from both religious groups and secular society advocates across the United States.
The US Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday on the constitutionality of displaying in public spaces the Ten Commandments, in a case on the officially mandated separation of church and state in US society.
While about 100 people from opposing groups protested outside the court, lawyers and court justices debated two challenges to the use of public property for displaying the commandments, fundamental moral precepts Jews and Christians believe God gave to Moses on Mount Sinai.
In the coming weeks, the court is expected to decide under what conditions, if at all, such displays are permitted under the US Constitution.
The Constitution's first amendment establishes the principle of separation of church and state, but how this should be interpreted remains unclear in the face of numerous contradictory decisions by courts over recent decades.
Wednesday, the Supreme Court reviewed two cases, one a challenge to the display of framed copies of the Ten Commandments in two Kentucky courthouses, among other documents that form the basis of US laws.
The second addressed the legality of a stone monument inscribed with the commandments, nationalist and and other religious symbols installed on the grounds of the Texas state legislature.
The hearings were marked by intense discussion of the meaning of the Ten Commandments in US traditions, examining whether they are essentially religious edicts or cultural norms.
Defenders cited the example of the commandment "Thou shalt not kill" as demonstrating that they do not contradict or surmount secular laws.
However, justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg challenged that view by noting that other commandments are specifically religious, one requiring observation of the sabbath.
"Have you read the first four commandments?" she demanded of one of her colleagues.
Appearing to endorse the displays while noting most Americans could not recite the commandments conservative justice Antonin Scalia called them "the symbol that government derives its authority from God."
"I see nothing wrong with the government reflecting that.
We're a tolerant society," Scalia said.
Liberal justice Stephen Breyer countered that, although the US is a highly religious country, "we are also committed to secularism."
The case has drawn extremely high interest from both religious groups and secular society advocates across the United States.
"Government supports Christianity, but we want it to be neutral," said Eric Heirman, who joined a group of atheists outside the court protesting against religious displays.
A young teenager, one of a group of people praying outside the court in support of the displays, argued to the contrary.
"I think religion has to be shown everywhere.
I think people should start to believe," he said.
While there were no clear indications of how the justices might rule, arguments frequently returned to the issue of the context of the display, with justices making reference to the 73 year old marble frieze in their own courtroom, which depicts Moses holding the commandments among numerous other historical figures of law.
The emphasis on context could possibly lead to the court avoiding making a categorical decision and instead ruling in favor of one of the displays and against the other.
The US political, religious and legal establishments are braced for two critical Supreme Court rulings on the Ten Commandments, weighing heavily on the separation of church and state.
The decision, expected as early as Thursday, could inflame conservative evangelical groups or opposing civil liberties lobbies, and thrust the court squarely into partisan politics.
And both sides of the divide will use whatever judgment day brings in the two cases to whip up partisans ahead of a looming battle over what could be imminent vacancies on the court bench.
Each case is born out of the religious and cultural struggle raging in modern America between radical evangelicals and advocates of the secular state.
The conservative religious right, a strong backer of President George W. Bush, argues that the country is a "Christian" state and decry attempts to deny that heritage.
Civil liberties advocates however fear a tide of evangelical Christianity is eroding the politically sacred separation of church and state, and endangering the principle that all Americans, whatever their religion, are created equal.
The more contentious question before the court, legal experts say, is a challenge to the display of framed copies in two Kentucky courthouses of the Ten Commandments, which Christians and Jews believe God handed to Moses on Mount Sinai.
"This case will answer whether or not the government may hew to a particular religious viewpoint and chose Christianity because there have been Christians in our heritage," said Marci Hamilton of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, Yeshiva University.
"Or whether the Supreme Court is going to take the heat, which it is going to get, and say there are some circumstances where the government cannot post the Ten Commandments despite their importance in our history and they must make it clear that every citizen is a citizen that is equal in the eyes of the law."
The second case surrounds the legality of a stone monument inscribed with the commandments and other religious symbols on the grounds of the Texas state legislature.
This may be easier to resolve than the Kentucky situation, as the monument was placed in a display of other historical monuments and was a private donation.
Therefore, justices could stake out a compromise position and argue that the display was not necessarily endorsed by the Texas state government, allowing it to fall within constitutional bounds.
The US Constitution's first amendment establishes the principle of separation of church and state, but how this should be interpreted remains unclear following numerous contradictory decisions by lower courts.
Justices may find a more delicate tightrope in the Kentucky case, as it was the government of McCreary County which put a plaque of the Ten Commandments in a courthouse, and defended the display through the courts.
It would be hard to argue therefore that the state government did not endorse the display, prompting some experts to believe the Supreme Court may come up with a split judgment on the Texas and Kentucky cases.
Differences over the cases were clear when the court took up the questions in March.
Appearing to endorse the displays, conservative justice Antonin Scalia called them "the symbol that government derives its authority from God."
"I see nothing wrong with the government reflecting that.
We're a tolerant society," Scalia said.
Liberal justice Stephen Breyer however countered that, although the US is a highly religious country, "we are also committed to secularism."
Sixty two decisions down, 12 to go.
The Supreme Court's 2004 2005 term, dominated by months of speculation over Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's health and retirement plans, will end as soon as next Monday.
As usual, several of the most contentious cases will be among the final rulings.
After announcing six decisions on Monday, the court has scheduled Thursday and next Monday as decision days.
If necessary, the justices will add another day next week.
These are the remaining cases: Ten Commandments: Perhaps the most closely watched cases are two that require the court to define the constitutional boundaries for governmental display of religious symbols.
The appeal in Van Orden v. Perry, No. 03 1500, challenges the display of a Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol.
In McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union, No. 03 1693, the question is the constitutionality of displays on the walls of two Kentucky county courthouses that include the text of the Ten Commandments along with historical documents, such as the Mayflower Compact.
File sharing: In a case of enormous interest to the entertainment and recording industries, the question in Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios v. Grokster Ltd., No. 04 480, is whether the companies that provide the software that enables computer users to share illegally downloaded files of copyrighted material are themselves liable for copyright infringement.
Internet access: In National Cable and Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Services, No. 04 277, the court will review the Federal Communications Commission's determination that companies offering broadband access through cable modem service do not have to permit competing Internet service providers to share their lines.
Industry groups say the shape of future Internet access could depend on this decision.
Private property: A closely watched case from New London, Conn., questions the government's use of the power of eminent domain to take, and pay for, private property for the purpose of fostering private economic development.
The question in the case, Kelo v. City of New London, No. 04 108, is whether such development fits the definition of "public use" for which the Fifth Amendment permits a "taking" of private property.
Domestic violence: The court will decide in Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, No. 04 278, whether a police department can be held liable for violating a victim's rights when harm ensues from a failure to enforce a court's order of protection.
In this case, a woman's estranged husband violated a protective order and kidnapped and killed their three daughters.
Jurisdiction: The court will decide whether the federal courts have jurisdiction over certain kinds of class action cases.
Two related appeals are likely to be decided by a single decision.
They are Ortega v. Star Kist Foods Inc., No. 04 79, and Exxon Corp. v. Allapattah Services Inc., No. 04 70.
Water rights: In Orff v. United States, No. 03 1566, the court will decide whether the federal government can be sued by farmers claiming a breach of contract in the delivery of water from the Central Valley reclamation project in California.
Right to counsel: The question in Halbert v. Michigan, No. 03 10198, is whether indigent defendants have a right to a government appointed lawyer to challenge aspects of a guilty plea.
Habeas corpus: In another criminal appeal, Gonzalez v. Crosby, No. 04 5432, the question is whether a defendant can use a petition for a writ of habeas corpus as a means for reopening certain earlier judgments.
Time limits: In Mayle v. Felix, No. 04 563, the question is how the one year time limit in the federal law governing habeas corpus petitions applies to a defendant's effort to add new claims to an existing petition.
Death penalty appeal: In Bell v. Thompson, No. 04 514, a death penalty case from Tennessee, the court will address the authority of a federal appeals court, on the basis of newly discovered evidence that is favorable to the defense, to change its mind and order a case reopened as the state is preparing to carry out a death sentence.
For the third week in a row, the Rev. Rob Schenck set up a podium and a large wood and marble display of the 10 commandments outside the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday, in anticipation that the high court would rule on two cases that challenge displays of the Decalogue on public property.
But after the justices announced their decisions in six other cases none of which tackled the contentious issue of religious displays Schenck packed up and headed off.
Schenck, the head of the conservative National Clergy Council, said he plans to return Thursday, the next day the Supreme Court is expected to hand down decisions.
He wants to be there so that he can give reporters his group's interpretation on the court's decisions in the 10 commandments cases, among the most anticipated rulings this year.
"We've been through this drill so many times," said Schenck, who has waited outside the court building in the waning weeks of previous terms for decisions involving gay rights and abortion.
"The court is a very disciplined branch of government.
They keep everybody including some internal people on pins and needles."
Schenck will be dueling with activists on the other side of the debate.
For example, Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, also has camped out at the court building on recent Mondays, ready to respond to a ruling.
No one outside the court knows for sure when the decision will be handed down so the partisans show up at the Supreme Court just in case.
Although the Supreme Court gives as much as a week's notice before the so called "decision days," it does not say in advance which rulings it will issue.
With 11 cases still undecided by the court and the panel's October 2004 term set to end next week throngs of advocates, lawyers and reporters are on edge.
In addition to issuing a verdict on the constitutionality of government sponsored displays of the 10 commandments, the court is expected to decide whether companies can be held liable for making computer software used to illegally download copyrighted music and movies.
The court also is set to rule whether the city of New London, Conn., violated the Constitution when it seized private property for redevelopment.
The Supreme Court typically issues its most anticipated rulings each year in the final days of June, before taking its annual three month break.
Tom Goldstein, a lawyer with the Washington, D.C., firm Goldstein & Howe who has argued before the Supreme Court, said the end of term rulings are typically "the most hard fought cases, where the justices are going back and forth, back and forth with their opinions" until the very last minute.
This year, the anticipation is especially intense because many believe Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist will decide to step down from the court after 33 years on the bench.
Rehnquist, 80, began treatment late last year for thyroid cancer.
If he decides to retire, Rehnquist could announce the move before the end of the month.
In a bid to catch the attention of the cameras and reporters at the building, Schenck's props include a two foot by three foot replica of the 10 commandments tablets.
He also has plenty of paper including at least three versions of news releases that cover possible outcomes.
"This is one of the most critical issues of our time, it has so much to say about what role religion will play in the future of our country," Schenck said.
"So much of the public's impression of these opinions comes in the way they're presented in the press, so we try to be out there immediately to give our perspective on it."

Los Angeles Times: Display of Scripture May Split Justices.
The Supreme Court struggled with the politically charged issue of whether prominent display of the Ten Commandments at government building violated separation of church and state.
The Supreme Court ruled Monday that displaying the Ten Commandments on government property does not necessarily violate the constitutional principle that there must be a separation between church and state.
In a pair of 5 4 rulings, the court said the display of the Ten Commandments in a 22 acre park at the Texas State Capitol was proper, but that the displays of the Commandments in two county courthouses in Kentucky were so overtly religious as to be impermissible.
The rulings, the first by the court in a quarter century on the emotional issue of the proper place of the Commandments in American life, conveyed the message that disputes over such religious displays must be decided case by case, and that the specific facts are all important.
Writing for the court, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist noted that at the Texas Capitol in Austin, a six foot monolith displaying the Commandments was just one of 17 sculptures.
"The inclusion of the Commandments monument in this group has a dual significance, partaking of both religion and government, that cannot be said to violate the Establishment Clause," the chief justice wrote.
Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer sided with the chief justice, with Justice Breyer calling the Texas dispute a difficult borderline case.
The dissenters were justices Sandra Day O'Connor, John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment decrees that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," and the Supreme Court has long held that the same rule must be applied to the states.
"While the Commandments are religious, they have an undeniable historical meaning," Rehnquist wrote.
"Simply having religious content or promoting a message consistent with a religious doctrine does not run afoul of the Establishment Clause."
But he added pointedly, "There are, of course, limits to the government's display of religious messages or symbols."
And those limits were exceeded in the Kentucky displays, the court held in an opinion by Justice Souter and joined by justices Stevens, O'Connor, Ginsburg and Breyer.
"The reasonable observer could only think that the counties meant to emphasize and celebrate the religious message," the majority held.
"The display's unstinting focus was on religious passages, showing that the counties posted the Commandments precisely because of their sectarian content."
Dissenting were Chief Justice Rehnquist and justices Scalia, Thomas and Kennedy.
The backgrounds of the Texas and Kentucky disputes were different in a way that the court found vitally important.
The Texas Ten Commandments monument was donated in 1961 by the Fraternal Order of Eagles and was just one of thousands donated by the fraternity across the country with the support of Cecil B. DeMille, the director, who was promoting his movie "The Ten Commandments."
Thomas Van Orden, a suspended lawyer, challenged the display in a lawsuit filed in 2002, after he became homeless.
The four decades between the erection of the monument and the challenge strongly suggest that there was little perception among the public that the Austin display was a government attempt to establish religion, the justices in the majority reasoned.
The crucial difference in the Kentucky case was that the Commandments were first displayed by themselves on the courthouse walls, and government officials did not display accompanying historical documents until after the American Civil Liberties Union complained about the Commandments exhibits.
"An observer would probably suspect the counties of reaching for any way to keep a religious document on the walls," the majority observed.
The majority noted that neither a federal district court nor the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit had found any "valid secular purpose" in the courthouse Commandments displays.
In the Texas case, on the other hand, both a district court and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had agreed that there was a valid secular purpose to the displays.
The Texas case is Van Orden v. Perry, No. 03 1500.
Gov. Rick Perry is named in his capacity as chairman of the State Preservation Board.
The Kentucky case is McCreary County v. the ACLU of Kentucky, No. 03 1693.
The last time the Supreme Court ruled on a Ten Commandments case was in 1980, when it invalidated a Kentucky law that required the posting of the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom.
After more than two decades of dodging the question, the U.S. Supreme Court this week heard oral arguments on whether Ten Commandments displays in courthouses and other public space are compatible with the First Amendment to the Constitution.
The cases before the court involve a Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of the Texas Capitol and a display of the commandments in a Kentucky courtroom.
The positions of the respective advocates are well known.
Maybe a solution, some of the justices seemed to suggest with their comments and questions from the bench, lies somewhere in the middle.
"It's so hard to draw that line," said Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
Justices seemed eager to stake that middle ground, wherever it might lie.
But by not decisively ruling for one side or the other, the Supreme Court would be doing a disservice to the nation.
This important question of religious freedom demands a clear answer from the high court.
Those who favor Ten Commandments displays take one of two tacks or a combination of the two.
They argue either that such displays only celebrate the religious and legal heritage of the United States, or as, put forth by former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore and some evangelicals, nothing in the Constitution prohibits government acknowledgment of God, with the Ten Commandments or other religious displays.
Opponents' reading of the First Amendment's "establishment clause," however, leaves no such room.
"An assertion that the Ten Commandments is the source, the foundation of our legal system ,that is simply wrapping the Ten Commandments in the flag, and that's endorsement," argued David Friedman, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, before the high court on Wednesday.
The search for a middle ground is attractive, if only because both extremes can be troubling.
It is difficult to imagine how displays of the Ten Commandments in courthouses or other government buildings can be taken as anything other than a government endorsement of a particular religious viewpoint.
That officials added non religious documents to the offending display in Kentucky after a lawsuit was filed reveals that intent.
Ironically, though, advocates of Ten Commandments displays are willing to downplay their religious significance of the precepts and instead argue their secular value as, what Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott called, a "recognized symbol of law."
So which is it, and why are supporters so willing to denigrate the Commandments' religious power to make their case?
Justice Antonin Scalia wants to know.
In response to Abbott, Scalia said, "You're watering it down to say the only message is a secular message,I can't agree with you.
'Our laws come from God.'
If you don't believe it sends that message, you're kidding yourself."
Scalia said that if Abbot's view were to prevail, it would be a "Pyrrhic victory."
Some on the other side are guilty of a similar cheapening, this time of the First Amendment.
I agree with those who see Ten Commandments displays in courthouses or on the grounds of the Texas Capitol as an affront to the First Amendment, but that does not mean all religious expression on public property or even the mentioning of "God" in the Pledge of Allegiance or on our money threatens the republic.
By using a one size fits all argument, whether against the Ten Commandments or "In God We Trust," civil libertarians and others sometimes look silly.
Yes, "under God" was added to the Pledge of Allegiance in 1954 to counter the "God less" communists, but that did not make a pledge a prayer inappropriate for a public school or anywhere else.
As an insult to the Constitution, it is nothing compared to a clearly religious monument in a public courthouse or on the grounds of the Texas Capitol.
"These are not simple messages, like 'In God We Trust,"' on U.S. currency, said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
"The Ten Commandments are a powerful statement of the covenant God made with his people."
The First Amendment was written to guarantee Americans the right to worship, or not worship, as they want, and to ban government from establishing or endorsing a particular faith.
Government breaches the First Amendment's "wall" between church and state when it reserves for the public space a monument with a clear religious message.
There is no middle ground on that.

The Supreme Court justices usually leave some of the hardest cases for the final month of the term, and this year is no different.
The court is due to decide 29 cases by the end of June, including nettlesome issues surrounding medical marijuana, the Ten Commandments and the Internet.
But this year, the term's end could be overshadowed by the retirement of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.
Since October, he has been battling thyroid cancer.
And though his voice has sounded stronger in recent weeks, he is widely expected to announce soon that he will step down at the end of the current term.
On Tuesday, the court will meet to hand down rulings, and it is likely to issue decisions on one or two days each week for the rest of June.
Here are key issues awaiting a decision: Ten Commandments.
Can government officials prominently display the Biblical Commandments at public buildings or in courthouses to demonstrate the nation's religious heritage?
Or does this official display amount to the government's promotion of religion in violation of the First Amendment?
The court will rule on two cases: a Ten Commandments monument outside the Texas state Capitol and plaques featuring the Commandments posted in Kentucky courthouses.
Medical marijuana.
Can federal agents raid the homes of California patients who grow marijuana for their own use?
Although the medical use of marijuana is legal in California and nine other states, federal authorities say they can override those state laws.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the federal officials had exceeded their constitutional power.
File sharing.
Can film studios and record labels go to court to shutdown Internet based companies that help computer users download free copies of music and movies?
This is a multibillion dollar question of copyright law.
The movie and record industries say unchecked Internet piracy threatens to make copyrights meaningless.
Internet access.
Must cable and phone companies allow outside companies, such as Earthlink, to offer broadband Internet service to customers, or may they instead reserve their lines for their own broadband service?
A divided Federal Communications Commission said cable companies can keep exclusive control of their lines.
If the FCC prevails, it plans to adopt the same rule for phone companies.
The outcome may determine how much choice consumers will have in Internet access.
Property rights.
May cities seize private property to make way for business development?
This Connecticut case could limit the government's power of "eminent domain."
The Constitution says officials may take possession of private property "for public use," and the homeowners who are fighting the city of New London say that private development is not a public use.
Restraining orders.
Can the police be sued for failing enforce a restraining order?
The case before the court is tragic a mother whose three daughters were murdered by her estranged husband but during the oral argument the justices were skeptical of the claim that the police can be held liable for not acting in time.
Religion in prison.
Can Congress require state prisons to make special accommodations for the religious needs of their inmates?
Five years ago, a bipartisan group of lawmakers won passage of a new law to further religious liberty, but prison officials have opposed it.
Juries and race.
What should judges do if prosecutors remove several blacks from the jury pool?
The court has said the Constitution forbids racial bias in selecting jurors, but it has struggled on how to enforce that rule.
Two cases raise this issue.
Drug research.
Can scientists make use of patented drugs and devices while researching new drugs?
A 1984 law exempted such research from charges of patent infringement, but that law has been read narrowly to cover only research data to be presented to the Food and Drug Administration.
Researchers at the Scripps Institute in La Jolla, Calif., were hit with a $15 million judgment for patent infringement.
( Cruise ships.
Does the federal law that protects disabled Americans from discrimination apply to passengers who travel on foreign flagged cruise ships?
This case tests the reach of U.S. law.
A 6 foot tall granite monument of the Ten Commandments outside the Texas capitol building is constitutional, but smaller displays of the Decalogue inside two Kentucky county courthouses must go, the Supreme Court ruled in separate decisions Monday.
The court said the purpose of the displays was the dividing line in the two cases as the justices weighed whether the exhibits violated the Constitution's First Amendment bar against government promotion of religion.
In the Texas case, the court ruled 5 4 that the tablet shaped monument was constitutional because it was part of a comprehensive, historical presentation on the state capitol grounds, one of 38 monuments and historical markers on the site.
Although the monument "has religious significance," the Ten Commandments also "have an undeniable historical meaning," Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote in an opinion joined by Associate Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
Justice Stephen Breyer concurred in a separate opinion.
"Simply having religious content or promoting a message consistent with a religious doctrine does not run afoul of the establishment clause," Rehnquist wrote.
In the Kentucky cases, the court ruled 5 4 that county officials stepped over the line because they had religious motives when they approved the construction of two displays of the Ten Commandments.
Breyer was the crucial swing vote, siding with conservative justices in support of the Texas monument, but joining the court's more liberal members to outlaw the Kentucky displays.
Legal scholars and public officials had hoped the Supreme Court would use the two cases to clear up years of confusion about what kind of religious displays are allowed on government property, but the issue was further muddled by the Texas and Kentucky decisions.
The court appeared to acknowledge that point, with Rehnquist noting in his opinion in the Texas case that there was no definitive formula for assessing the constitutionality of government sponsored religious displays.
In effect, the court said, it would have to sort out the principles one case at a time.
Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which opposed both displays of the commandments, said the split decisions "just guarantee there will be far more lawsuits and far more confusion about religious displays on public property."
For years, the Supreme Court has struggled with whether to lower or raise the wall separating government and religion but a clear guide for the future has remained elusive.
Although the court has ruled that legislatures can open their sessions with prayers and has upheld state and local laws barring the sale of alcohol on Sundays, it also has struck down a law mandating that the Ten Commandments be displayed in schoolrooms.
In his opinion in the Texas case, Rehnquist acknowledged the difficulty in defining the line.
"Our institutions presuppose a supreme being, yet these institutions must not press religious observances upon their citizens," Rehnquist wrote.
The court must "neither abdicate our responsibility to maintain a division between church and state, nor evince a hostility to religion by disabling the government from in some ways recognizing our religious heritage."
As evidence of the difficulty in reaching consensus, the nine justices together issued seven separate opinions in the Texas case and three in the Kentucky case.
"I didn't know we had that many people on our court," Rehnquist quipped Monday.
In the Kentucky case, the court based its ruling on the history of the displays in two county courthouses, the exhibits were modified twice in response to a lawsuit and a lower court ruling against the displays, steps that Justice David Souter writing for the majority said were designed to conceal the basic religious motivation behind the display.
In addition to Breyer, Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Souter in the majority.
The first exhibits, created in 1999, consisted of framed copies of the Ten Commandments in the McCreary County courthouse in Whitley City, Ky., and the Pulaski County courthouse in Somerset, Ky. Later, county officials added excerpts of other historical documents containing religious references, including passages from the Declaration of Independence, the preamble to the state constitution and a proclamation by former President Abraham Lincoln.
In its final version, the Ten Commandments were surrounded by historic American and British political and patriotic documents and a statement asserting that the commandments "have profoundly influenced the formation of Western legal thought."
Nonetheless, Souter said there was "ample support" for a lower court's finding "of a predominantly religious purpose" behind the displays.
Although Kentucky officials described the display as including documents "foundational" to American government, the collection was not comprehensive, Souter wrote.
The only real connection is that materials included religious references, Souter said.
An observer "would probably suspect that the counties were simply reaching for any way to keep a religious document on the walls of courthouses constitutionally required to embody religious neutrality," Souter wrote.
In a dissenting opinion, Scalia blasted the court's majority, arguing that "the commandments have a proper place in our civil history."
On the bench Monday, Scalia took the unusual step of reading his dissent in the courtroom, prefacing his comments by saying the court's ruling against the Kentucky displays "ratchets up this court's hostility to religion."
"Invocation of the almighty by our public figures, at all levels of government, remains commonplace," Scalia wrote, noting that even inside the Supreme Court building, Moses is depicted holding the Ten Commandments and that court sessions open with a clerk proclaiming "God save the United States and this honorable court."
In other decisions on the final day of the Supreme Court's 2004 term, the justices: Unanimously decided that makers of software that can be used to illegally download copyrighted music and movies can be held liable when they "foster infringement."
The ruling is a victory for the entertainment industry, which has complained that widespread downloading of movies and music is hurting their bottom line.
The court said the makers of file sharing programs Grokster and Morpheus had acted in bad faith by promoting their products as tools for illegally obtaining copyrighted content.
Companies who make and market products legitimately only later learning they are being used for illegal purposes would not be liable, the court said.
Declined to review an appeal by New York Times reporter Judith Miller and Time magazine reporter Matthew Cooper, who face jail time for refusing to testify about confidential news sources.
The court's decision, which was made without comment, sends Miller and Cooper's case back to U.S. District Court, which could order the reporters' imprisonment this week.
To put the case on the court's docket for the 2005 term, which begins in October, at least four justices would have to vote in favor of considering the case.

With demonstrators shouting religious slogans outside, Supreme Court justices questioned, argued and fretted over whether Ten Commandments displays on government property cross the line of separation between church and state.
Back to back arguments in cases from Texas and Kentucky were the court's first consideration of the issue since 1980, when justices ruled the Ten Commandments could not be displayed in public schools.
Clearly reluctant to adopt a blanket ban, the current justices wrestled on Wednesday with the role that religious symbols should play in public life right down to the Ten Commandments display in their own courtroom.
Several expressed support for a 6 foot (1.8 meter) granite monument on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol, but were less certain about framed copies of the commandments in two Kentucky courthouses.
"If an atheist walks by, he can avert his eyes," Justice Anthony Kennedy said in a courtroom filled with spectators, many of whom could be seen glancing at the court's frieze of Moses carrying the tablets.
Banning the Texas display might "show hostility to religion," he said.
But Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, while acknowledging the nation's religious history, wondered where the line should be drawn.
The court ruled in 1983 that legislative prayer is allowable, citing its historical significance, but in 1992 said prayer in public schools is not because students may feel pressure to participate.
What if every federal court had a Ten Commandments display over its bench and opened with a prayer, Ginsburg asked, brushing aside Justice Antonin Scalia's retort that the justices already open their sessions with "God save this honorable court."
"We would try and defend that," said acting Solicitor General Paul Clement, who argued on behalf of the Bush administration in supporting the Ten Commandments displays.
A pivotal vote in the case is expected to be Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who in recent years has been at the forefront in outlining constitutional tests based in part on a symbol's history and "ubiquity."
She did not tip her hand Wednesday, if she had one.
"It's so hard to draw that line" between allowing a legislative prayer and not allowing a Ten Commandments display, O'Connor fretted at one point.
Monuments carrying the Ten Commandments are common in town squares, courthouses and other government owned land around the country.
Lawyers challenging these displays argue that they violate the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment ban on any law "respecting an establishment of religion."
While the cases strictly involve Ten Commandments displays, a broad ruling could determine the allowable role of religion in a wide range of public contexts, from the use of religious music in a school concert to students' recitation of "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance.
A decision is expected by late June.
The question has prompted dozens of heated legal battles, including one in Alabama by Roy Moore.
He lost his job as chief justice a year ago after defying a federal order to remove a 5300 pound (2385 kilogram) Ten Commandments monument he had installed in the state courthouse.
At the Supreme Court, about 100 supporters of commandments displays gathered outside in the icy cold.
Many shouted "Amen" and broke into refrains from the hymn "Amazing Grace."
Several knelt before the court steps.
Opponents of the displays, smaller in number, waved signs reading "Keep Government and Religion Separate" and "My God Does Not Need Government Help."
According to an AP Ipsos poll, 76 percent of Americans support such displays, a fact that was not lost on some of the justices during arguments.
"It's a profoundly religious message, but it's a profoundly religious message believed in by a vast majority of the American people," Scalia said.
In the Texas case, the Fraternal Order of Eagles donated the exhibit to the state in 1961, and it was installed about 75 feet (22.5 meters) from the Capitol in Austin.
The group gave thousands of similar monuments to American towns during the 1950s and '60s, and those have been the subject of multiple court fights.
The suit was brought by Thomas Van Orden, a former lawyer who is now homeless.
Van Orden, who enlisted the help of Duke law professor Erwin Chemerinsky in the appeal, said in an interview that he spent the morning at the University of Texas law library playing chess online.
He did not comment on the case.
Two Kentucky counties, meanwhile, hung framed copies of the Ten Commandments in their courthouses and added other documents, such as the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence, after the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the display.
While one lower court found the Texas display to be predominantly nonreligious because it was one of 17 monuments in a 22 acre (8.8 hectare) park, another court struck down the Kentucky displays as lacking a "secular purpose."
Kentucky's modification of the display was a "sham" for the religious intent behind it, the Cincinnati based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled.
Arguing against a strict wall between church and state, Solicitor General Clement said, "The Ten Commandments have an undeniable religious significance, but they also have a secular significance as a source of the law, a code of the law and a well recognized historical symbol of the law."
David Friedman, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who is challenging the courthouse displays in Kentucky, countered: "An assertion that the Ten Commandments is THE source, THE foundation of our legal system ,that is simply wrapping the Ten Commandments in the flag, and that's endorsement."
The Supreme Court's frieze depicts Moses as well as 17 other figures including Hammurabi, Confucius, Napoleon and Chief Justice John Marshall.
When Stevens said the depiction is more neutral in part because it does not display the Ten Commandments' text, Clement gently demurred.
"I don't know if a display of Moses might be sending more of a religious message.
On the Net: A transcript from the Supreme Court argument in Van Orden v. Perry is available at:
Supreme Court justices voiced concern Wednesday during arguments in a lawsuit over a Ten Commandments monument in Austin, Texas, that efforts to preserve separation of church and state could reach a "hostility toward religion."
Justices seemed to grapple for a standard that would keep government from endorsing a particular religion, without eradicating America's historical and cultural ties to religion in a case brought by Thomas Van Orden, a Texas man who said he was offended by the display of the biblical edicts on the Capitol grounds.
That case, along with a companion lawsuit from Kentucky argued Wednesday, could result in a far reaching new definition of when it is appropriate for words or symbols with religious content to be displayed in courthouses, schools and other public buildings.
Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, making his first ever argument before the Supreme Court, said that the commandments should be seen as a "recognized symbol of law" and not as an endorsement by the state of a particular religion.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor noted that the high court had already decided that Congress and state legislatures can begin their day with a prayer.
"It is so hard to draw that line if the legislature can open its session with a prayer but can't display the Ten Commandments" on the statehouse grounds, she said.
Justice Anthony Kennedy worried that efforts to extinguish all religious displays on government property were "obsessive" and could amount to a "hostility toward religion" by the high court.
He wondered aloud why someone who was offended by the words of the commandments couldn't simply look away.
Erwin Chemerinsky, a Duke University law professor who argued the case for Van Orden, told the justices, "This monument, standing alone, does convey the state's endorsement of religion."
And, as for nonbelievers simply ignoring the monument, Chemerinsky said, it wasn't that simple.
The display created an atmosphere where "some feel like insiders and some feel like outsiders."
At issue is a red granite monument donated to Texas in 1961 by the Fraternal Order of the Eagles.
That group donated hundreds of the commandment statues to state and local governments all across America.
The Austin case reached the high court on appeal after a lower court ruled the monument did not violate the so called Establishment Clause in the Constitution, which says, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."
Since 1980, more than two dozen courts have ruled on displays of the Ten Commandments in government settings.
Those cases have created a contradictory legal thicket that the justices seemed eager to cut through with a decisive ruling.
But if consensus was emerging among the justices on a formula that would achieve that goal, it was not evident during questioning Wednesday.
Abbott, 47, was grilled by the justices as he argued that the Austin monument should be seen as part of the "museum like" display of Lone Star history on the grounds that also includes tributes to the Alamo, Texas pioneer women, Confederate veterans and others.
"I was pleased we were able to get across to the court our message that what the monument does is acknowledge religion's role in state history without endorsing religion," Abbott said after the session ended.
Asked how he thought the state would fare when an opinion is delivered by the court sometime later this year, he said, "I realize that you can't make predictions based on comments from the bench."
Van Orden, who brought the case, declined to be interviewed Wednesday.
He was in Texas as the case was argued.
Some justices seemed skeptical of Abbott's argument that the Ten Commandments were not basically a religious expression.
And surrounding the commandments with other memorials didn't necessarily change the message being sent to the public.
"It would be crazy law from this court that said you can engage in religious (display) as long as you hide the ball well enough," said Justice David Souter.
As lawyers and justices debated, the image of Moses holding the disputed tablets peered down from a vanilla marble frieze in the chamber, part of a majestic tableau, including Hammurabi and Confucius, honoring the development of law.
That portrayal of the commandments, in which some of the text can be seen in Hebrew, served as a backdrop for many of the questions Wednesday.
Lawyers opposed to the Ten Commandments displayed in Austin and in two Kentucky courthouses said the context of the Supreme Court carving made it acceptable, but to have the commandments standing alone sent a different message that there was a state sanctioned religion in America.
Justice Antonin Scalia noted that public opinion polls show at least three quarters of Americans support the display of the Ten Commandments.
He asked why a minority opposed to the display shouldn't be "tolerant of the majority."
The debate inside the high court unfolded as a more strident war of words raged outside in the frigid March air.
Those passionately opposed to removing the statue and those just as fervently committed to seeing it go held rallies, amid cardboard commandments and signs noting, "Atheists Have Rights Too."
The Rev. Aubrey Vaughan, a pastor at Houston's Grace Baptist Church, was carrying a stack of paper that contained 5000 signatures he'd collected since last year in support of the Ten Commandments monument.
"Support is overwhelming in Texas.
Even people who aren't very religious said the monument should stay.
It doesn't harm anybody," he said.
Eric Herrman of Millersville, Md., of the American Atheists, a group supporting the rights of atheists, said, "As an atheist, I feel like a second class citizen.
The government should not favor any religion."
One possible narrow solution to the Texas case emerged during the questioning when Justice John Paul Stevens suggested the state simply add a disclaimer to the statue saying it was not meant as an endorsement of religion.
Abbott said that disclaimer was already implied by the words on the statue noting it was a gift from the Eagles, and by the lack of a Texas state seal.
Sri Lanka's top Tamil Tiger rebel group on Friday began a week long meeting in Switzerland which is meant to prepare for the next round of peace talks with the Sri Lankan government, the Swiss foreign ministry said.
Swiss officials met the chief negotiator of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), Anton Balasingham and other rebel officials on the sidelines of the meeting of the LTTE's Consitutional Affairs Committee in Geneva, which is due to end on October 7.
The Swiss foreign ministry said in a statement that it "welcomes the LTTE's continuing willingness to negotiate, and calls for peace talks to be resumed as soon as possible".
The LTTE has blamed the government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga for the delay in reviving negotiations which the rebels themselves suspended in April last year.
But Kumaratunga said last month that the Tigers were holding up talks aimed at ending a conflict that has claimed more than 60000 lives since 1972.
The Tamil Tigers were reportedly undertaking a three week tour of Denmark, Ireland, Switzerland and Sri Lanka's peace broker Norway to persuade donors to use aid as a tool to pressure the government to resume peace talks based on rebel self rule proposals.
The Swiss foreign ministry said "a possible interim administration of the north east of Sri Lanka as decided in the peace talks should be based on a federal structure within a united Sri Lanka" and backed Norway's role as facilitator.
Switzerland has a large community of Sri Lankan Tamil emigrants, and the country's decentralised federal political system has been cited as a potential model for the Indian Ocean island.
Sri Lankan Tamil Tiger rebels on Tuesday denied their killing of a Swiss national in the eastern Batticaloa town and accused a media report of discrediting the rebel group by concocting the story.
"We strongly dismiss this allegation which is based on speculation and concoction of a story to discredit the LTTE ( Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam)," a rebel statement said.
The rebels said that Acting Head of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission Hagrup Haukland has informed them that the preliminary investigation conducted by the truce monitors indicated that "this is an individual criminal act which has no connection whatsoever with the LTTE."
A 61 year old Swiss national named Hans Ulrich was killed Monday night by a hand grenade thrown into his toilet in Batticaloa town.
A media report has said that the killing was carried out by the LTTE rebels.
The east of the country has been a scene of continuous internecine clashes between the main LTTE rebel group in the north and their renegade eastern commander known as Karuna.
Karuna split from the main rebel group with his 6000 fighters in March this year, but he went underground one month later when his fighting squad was crushed by the mainstream faction.
Japanese special envoy Yasushi Akashi will arrive here later this month to push for the early resumption of peace talks between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tiger rebels, the state owned Sunday Observer newspaper reported.
Akashi, who is due to be here on Oct 27, will hold talks with high ranking officials of both the government and the opposition in capital Colombo and the leadership of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels in the rebel held northern town of Kilinochchi.
He is expected to raise the issues of LTTE's recruitment of child soldiers and political killings in the north and east as well as in Colombo when he meets the LTTE leadership.
Akashi will also meet diplomats of countries concerned in Sri Lanka including representatives from international organizations over the issues of peace in the country.
On his way back home, Akashi will meet with Indian leaders and diplomats who are concerned about the Norwegian brokered peace process in Sri Lanka.
He said that the Japanese government is optimistic over the peace process in Sri Lanka and pledged Japan's continuous assistance for reconstruction of the war torn country.
Peace talks between the government and the LTTE rebels have been on hold since April last year after six previous rounds which started in September 2002.
A total of 10 Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels were released on bail on Thursday in the eastern Batticaloa district, the pro rebel Tamilnet said.
The group of rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Tiger rebels (LTTE) were release under the orders of the country's Court of Appeal on cash bail, 50000 rupees (about 485 US dollars) for each and with two sureties, each signing a bond for the same amount.
The rebels have been handed over to their representatives in the rebel controlled territory in the east under the supervision of the truce monitors, the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission.
The rebels including four females were arrested by police in July this year and charged under the Offensive Weapons Act.
The LTTE rebels have been observing a Norwegian brokered ceasefire since February 2002 when the two sides entered a truce agreement.
Sri Lanka's elite police commandos Saturday shot dead a renegade Tamil rebel who killed a regional commander from the main guerrilla group, an official said.
The breakaway faction of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) shot dead a local commander known as Jude in the eastern Akkaraipattu region and minutes after commandos gunned down the assassin, police Special Task Force chief Nimal Leuke said.
The man killed by the commandos belonged to the breakaway faction of renegade commander V. Muralitharan, better known as Karuna, who went underground in April after leading an unprecedented split in March.
"We've been accused of siding with Karuna's group, but what we have shown that all we are interested is in maintaining law and order in areas where we are present," Leuke said.
Diplomats involved in Sri Lanka's stalled peace process have said the factional fighting was holding up efforts to revive direct negotiations between Colombo and the main rebel outfit.
The government here has accused the Tigers of killing over 250 of their political rivals since a truce arranged by peacebroker Norway went into effect in February 2002.
More than 60000 people have been killed in Sri Lanka's separatist campaign led by the LTTE which was established in 1972.
Sri Lankan Tamil rebels have said that they will release two homeguards held captive by them on Monday at the earliest possible date after they were produced before a rebel court in Sampur in the east of the country, the official Daily News said on Saturday.
Hagrup Haukland, deputy chief of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission overseeing the ongoing ceasefire between the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels, said that the rebels had convey this message to them after consultation with their political wing leader S.P. Thamilselvan currently on a European tour.
He said that the two homeguards will be released on bail by LTTE on Monday and handed over to their family members.
The two homeguards were abducted by the LTTE rebels on Aug 10 in the eastern port district of Trincomalee along with two T 56 weapons and a magazine.
Ever since their abduction by the rebels, the Trincomalee town has seen a series of protests against the LTTE act and the demonstrators have been demanding the release of the two homeguards.
The release of the two homeguards comes after a group of 10 LTTE rebels charged under the Offensive Weapons Ordnance were set free on bail on Thursday in the eastern Batticaloa district under a court order.
Sri Lankan government has finalised a set of counter proposals to the Interim Self Governing Authority (ISGA) proposal put forward by the Tamil Tiger rebles, the government spokesman said here Thursday.
Mangala Samaraweera, the Minister of Information and Ports, said "counter proposals are ready and waiting," adding that the government was looking forward to the revival of direct negotiations with Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels.
Samaraweera stressted "we are baffled by the LTTE's delay in starting negotiations" referring to the current hiatus in the Norwegian brokered peace process.
The ISGA proposals, also LTTE's interim power sharing blueprint, which was presented in October last year, were heavily criticised by Samaraweera's party then in opposition.
The new government after gaining power in April has been reluctant to start talks on the ISGA while the LTTE rebels have insisted that their ISGA proposals should be basis for the resumption of the peace talks.
The peace talks between the government and the LTTE rebels have been on hold since April last year when the rebels walked out following six rounds of direct negotiations under the Wickremesinghe regime.
Two more killings took place in Sri Lanka's eastern area on Thursday night amid continuous internecine clashes between Tamil Tiger rebel rival factions, police said Friday.
Two members belonging to the mainstream Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels were killed in a shooting incident that happened late Thursday night at the eastern Batticaloa district's Punkudawali area controlled by the LTTE rebels.
The LTTE's renegade eastern commander known as Karuna was suspected for the killings, police said.
Two more LTTE's members were seriously injured when unknown gunmen fired at them in another incident at Kaluwankerni in the Muslim dominated town of Valaichchenai in the east, police added.
Internecine clashes between rival factions of Tamil rebels have hampered the government efforts to revive the stalled peace negotiations on hold since April last year.
Karuna broke ranks with the mainstream rebel group in March this year.
The split has caused an escalation of violence in the east of the country.
The LTTE rebels have accused the government of colluding with Karuna to fight against them but the accusation was vehemently denied by the government.
Japan's special envoy Yasushi Akashi arrived here on Wednesday to start a seven day visit to push for an early resumption of peace talks between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tiger rebels, governmental sources said.
Akashi will stay in the country until Nov 2 to persuade the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE) to resume peace talks as soon as possible.
During his visit, Akashi is scheduled to meet with Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse and other officials to discuss the current situation of the peace process.
Akashi will also visit the rebel held northern town of Kilinochchi and meet with the leaders of the LTTE rebels.
Peace talks between the government and the LTTE rebels have been deadlocked since April last year after six previous rounds which started in September 2002.
Internecine clashes between Sri Lankan Tamil Tiger rebels' rival factions continued in the east and one of the members of the mainstream rebel group has been killed, defense officials said on Thursday.
Dharmalingam Thyagalingam, a 37 year old loyalist of the mainstream Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) faction was killed Wednesday night at Welikanda area in the east by members loyal to the renegade rebel eastern commander known as Karuna.
His killing came after Tuesday's killings of two Muslims by mainstream rebel members for supporting Karuna.
Internecine killings have become a feature mainly in the east of the country ever since Karuna broke ranks with the LTTE in March this year.
He challenged the leadership of the Tiger supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran and blamed the LTTE leader for alleged favoritism of northern members over the eastern ones.
The clashes have spilled into the Norwegian backed peace process to end the country's two decades of ethnic conflict.
The peace process stalled since April 2003 is yet to be revived as internecine clashes have stood in the way among other issues.
The LTTE mainstream group accuses the military of providing cover to Karuna but the charges have been denied by the government.
A senior leader of Sri Lanka's rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said it is ready to resume peace talks with the government if its self rule proposal gets a positive response, a local newspaper reported Sunday.
LTTE political wing leader S.P. Thamilselvan said Saturday that it wants a positive response from the government on its Interim Self Governing Authority (ISGA) proposal, said a report of The Sunday Times.
The LTTE rebels' position was also conveyed to Japanese peace envoy Yasushi Akashi, the paper quoted Thamilselvan as saying.
LTTE chief negotiator Anton Balasingham will arrive in Sri Lanka on Tuesday to assist LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in talks with Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen, who will be here on Wednesday.
However, Petersen has said that he is not coming to Sri Lanka with "high expectations."
"Based on signals from the parties over recent weeks, I do not have high expectation, but in difficult situations it is even more important to keep engaging with the parties," the Norwegian Embassy in Sri Lanka quoted Petersen as saying.
The rebels submitted their ISGA proposal to the previous government of former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the end of October last year but the proposal was rejected by President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
The LTTE rebels insists that the ISGA proposal should serve as the basis for the resumption of the stalled peace talks but the government wants to talk about a final solution to the two decades of ethnic conflict simultaneously.
The LTTE rebels had been fighting against government forces to set up an independent Tamil homeland in the north and east since 1983 until they entered into a Norwegian brokered ceasefire in February 2002.
The Norwegian facilitators have been trying to revive the stalled peace talks since May this year but their efforts have been futile so far.
A Norwegian peace envoy arrived in Colombo on Tuesday to revive Sri Lanka's stalled peace process as the Tamil rebels' chief negotiator returned from London to join the talks, official sources said.
Norwegian special envoy Erik Solheim has held talks with Rauf Hakeem, leader of the country's main Muslim party Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, one day before Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen's scheduled visit to the country on Wednesday, officials said.
On the other hand, Sri Lanka's rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) chief negotiator Anton Balasingham arrived in rebel held northern town of Kilinochchi on Tuesday, the pro rebel TamilNet said.
Balasingham will consult with the Tamil Tiger supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran regarding the current state of the peace process in Sri Lanka, LTTE officials said.
The objective of Balasingham's coming back to Sri Lanka is to assist the LTTE leader in talks with Norwegian foreign minister Jan Peterson, who will be here to push for a fresh attempt to revive the tottering peace talks between the government and the Tamil Tigers rebel.
LTTE political wing leader S.P. Thamilselvan said Saturday that it is ready to resume peace talks with the government if its self rule proposal gets a positive response.
However, Petersen has said earlier that he is not coming to Sri Lanka with "high expectations."
"Based on signals from the parties over recent weeks, I do not have high expectation, but in difficult situations it is even more important to keep engaging with the parties," the Norwegian Embassy in Sri Lanka quoted Petersen as saying.
The LTTE rebels had been fighting against government forces to set up an independent Tamil homeland in the north and east since 1983 until they entered into a Norwegian brokered ceasefire in February 2002.
The peace talks between the government and the Tamil Tiger rebels have been on hold since April last year when the rebels walked out after six rounds of direct negotiations owing to LTTE's adherence to their self rule proposal.
The Norwegian facilitators have been trying to revive the stalled peace talks since May this year but their efforts have been futile so far.
Sri Lanka's rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said Tuesday that the government and all its coalition partners should convey their unified stand and their consensus in support of the peace process, reported the pro rebel TamilNet.
"The Sri Lankan government's coalition partner, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and others are opposing the peace process.
Therefore we cannot depend on the Sri Lankan President alone to take forward the peace process," the LTTE's political wing leader S.P. Thamilselvan said.
"This is what our leader conveyed to the Sri Lankan President through the Norwegian Foreign Minister," Thamilselvan told reporters in the rebel held north town of Kilonochchi after holding meeting with LTTE supporters in Parliament to discuss efforts to revive peace talks with the government.
All 22 lawmakers from the Tamil National Alliance, which represents the rebels in the 225 member Parliament, attended the meeting held Tuesday in Kilinochchi.
"Our leader explained our stand on the peace process very clearly to the Norwegians.
We are prepared to start talks on the basis of the ISGA (Interim Self Governing Authority) unconditionally," Thamilselvan said.
The LTTE said Thursday that it conveyed a message through Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Peterson to President Chandrika Kumaratunga on how to take the country's stalled peace process forward during Peterson's meeting with LTTE supremo Velupillai Pirapaharan in Kilonochchi.
The LTTE rebels had been fighting against government forces to set up an independent Tamil homeland in the north and east since 1983 until they entered into a Norwegian brokered cease fire in February 2002.
Decades of conflicts have claimed more than 60000 lives.
The government and the LTTE held six rounds of direct negotiations between September 2002 and April 2003 before they were deadlocked over the rebels' central demand for interim self rule in large areas of the war torn north and east that they control.
The Norwegien facalitators have been trying to revive the stalled peace talks since May this year but their efforts have been futile so far.
Japanese envoy Yasushi Akashi has wrapped up talks with Sri Lankan government figures but is waiting to meet Tamil Tiger leaders in an effort to help salvage the island's peace process, officials said Sunday.
Akashi who arrived late Wednesday, was due to travel to the rebel held north Sunday but had to put off his plans because the main guerrilla political wing leader, S.P. Thamilselvan, was still abroad, officials said.
They said Akashi was hopeful of meeting with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) leadership before leaving the island on Tuesday as officials said they expected Thamilselvan to return from Europe by Monday.
Akashi met President Chandrika Kumaratunga Friday, a day after seeing Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse and opposition political leaders from the Sri Lankan parliament.
"The president described to Mr Akashi the recent developments in the peace process and the importance of beginning direct peace talks between the government and the LTTE as soon as possible," Kumaratunga's office said.
It said in a statement that Kumaratunga thanked Japan for its "generous assistance and support" to Sri Lanka's economic development and the consolidation of peace in the country.
Japan is Sri Lanka's largest single donor of aid and in recent years has taken a hands on approach to support the Norwegian backed process aimed at ending three decades of ethnic bloodshed that has claimed 60000 lives.
Akashi's latest mission came as Tamil Tigers said they had not abandoned their right to secede despite agreeing to explore a federal solution during talks with Colombo in December 2002.
Diplomats said Akashi could broach the subject with the LTTE leadership when he meets them.
The Tigers suspended their participation in direct negotiations in April last year describing six rounds of talks with the government as a "waste of time".
The LTTE insists that talks can resume based only on a proposal for an Interim Self Governing Authority envisaging regional autonomy.
The peace process is officially blocked over differences on an agenda to restart talks, but diplomats engaged in the initiative say a serious split among the Tamil Tigers could be the real reason.
More policemen are being deployed in Sri Lankan capital Colombo following increasing violence reportedly having connection with Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels, official sources said Friday.
Security measures in key street junctions have been tightened with more roadblocks set up by heavily armed men in the capital of the island country.
"It is a preventive action," said Sirisena Herath, deputy inspector general of police for Colombo.
A Tamil businessman belonging to a rival Tamil group that supports a united Sri Lanka was shot dead late Thursday when he was drinking tea at a hotel in Colombo.
Velayutham Dayalakumar, 44, was shot several times at close range and died on the spot.
His companion, whose name was not released, sustained injuries, police said.
Dayalakumar was a member of the Peoples Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE).
Formerly a Tamil separatist group, the PLOTE gave up violence in 1989 and joined Sri Lanka's political mainstream.
It continues to support Tamil rights, but within a united Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, the office of a rival Tamil political party was raid Thursday evening.
Military sources said a suspected LTTE member hurled a hand grenade at the office of the Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP) in the country's eastern town of Chenkaladi while a EPDP supporter was inside.
The office was damaged, but no injuries were reported.
The LTTE blame the violence on elements who want to discredit them although the victims are members of breakaway rebel factions.
The heightened security comes just days before a visit by Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen, who is due next week to revive the country's peace process.
Petersen is scheduled to meet Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, who lives in hiding and is rarely seen in public.
The Sri Lankan government and the LTTE are deadlocked over the later's central demand for interim self rule in the war torn north and east.
Sri Lanka's government Friday accused Tamil Tiger guerrillas of breaking a Norwegian arranged ceasefire by killing a government soldier and a military informant.
The government said in a statement that Thursday's killing of a soldier from the military intelligence unit and an informant had all the "hallmarks" of the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
"This is a direct violation of the ceasefire agreement which calls on the parties not to engage in assassinations," the statement said.
"The continuing violations cast doubts on the seriousness of the commitment of the LTTE."
The statement said it also raised doubts about the LTTE's interest in observing the Norwegian led peace initiative aimed at ending three decades of ethnic bloodshed.
Unidentified gunmen shot dead the two men in the island's east Thursday.
The attackers opened fire as the victims rode a motorcycle in the district of Polonnaruwa, the officials said, adding that investigations were under way to track down the killers.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
The military has blamed similar attacks on the Tamil Tigers.
The government has accused the Tigers of killing more than 250 rivals, including military informants, since the Norwegian brokered ceasefire went into effect from February 23, 2002.
A special peace envoy from Japan left here Monday morning for Sri Lanka's rebel held north to facilitate peace talks in the country, said official sources.
Yasushi Akashi, who arrived here last Wednesday, is to hold talks with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) political leadership on its stalled peace talks with the Sri Lankan government.
The LTTE's political wing leader S.P. Thamilselvan, returning from a month long European tour early Monday, was flown to the northern Kilinochchi district on board a Sri Lanka air force helicopter.
Akashi, who was appointed by the Japanese government two years ago to underline the international community's support toward the resolution of Sri Lanka's ethnic strife, is on a week long tour to expedite the resumption of talks.
He has held talks with the Sri Lankan President, Prime Minister and other senior political party leaders in the last few days.
Efforts by the Norwegian peace facilitators to restart the process stalled since April 2003 have been of no avail so far.
The Sri Lankan government and the LTTE held six rounds of direct negotiations between September 2002 and April 2003.
Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen will visit Sri Lanka from Nov 10 to 12, the Norwegian Embassy in Sri Lanka said Thursday in a press release.
Petersen will meet Sri Lankan President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and other government officials as well as leaders of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels, the release said.
The objective of his visit is to maintain close contacts between the facilitator and concerned parties in a bid to take the peace process forward, the release said.
The LTTE rebels and the government entered the ceasefire in February 2002 and started face to face negotiations seven months later but the rebels walked out the talks last April.
The Norwegian facilitators have been trying to revive the stalled peace talks since May this year but their efforts have so far been futile.
A Tamil Tiger member was killed by unidentified gunmen on Wednesday night in eastern Sri Lanka, the police said Thursday.
The victim, Maheswaran Rusangan, was shot dead as he returned to his home in the eastern town of Valaichchenai, 280 kilometers from the capital Colombo, said the police.
The pro rebel Website TamilNet said Rusangan, a political worker of the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), was shot dead by gunmen "suspected to be paramilitary operatives working with the Sri Lanka military intelligence".
There has been sporadic fighting in the eastern region since former top rebel commander Karuna split from the mainstream LTTE in March, taking with him some 6000 fighters.
Karuna went underground one month later.
The internal conflict of the LTTE has hampered the Norwegian facilitators' efforts to try to revive the stalled peace talks in the country.
The LTTE rebels walked out of the peace talks in April last year after six rounds, which commenced in September 2002, seven months after the cease fire between the government and the LTTE.
A landmine explosion has resulted in the deaths of at least ten people belonging to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels, the state television announced here Monday.
The Rupavahini TV said the landmine explosion took place at Tharavikulam in the eastern Batticaloa district around 11:00 a.m. local time (GMT 0050).
The TV said the LTTE rebels were traveling on a tractor when the landmine exploded in an area under their control, but it did not say who was responsible for the attack.
Internecine clashes between the rival LTTE factions have caused many deaths since the LTTE's former eastern commander Karuna revolted against the leadership of the rebel leader Velupillai Prabakaran in March this year.
LOS ANGELES A handyman accused of causing the Jan 26 Metrolink crash that killed 11 passengers and injured nearly 200 others was ordered Thursday to stand trial on murder and arson charges.
Wrapping up a three day preliminary hearing, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William R. Pounders determined there is enough evidence to try Juan Manual Alvarez, 26, of Compton on charges stemming from the deadliest U.S. train crash since 1999.
He is scheduled to be arraigned on May 19 on 11 counts of murder, including the special circumstance allegations of multiple murder, train wrecking and arson.
Prosecutors have not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty.
Witnesses testified that Alvarez doused his Jeep Cherokee with gasoline, then abandoned it on the railroad tracks near Glendale, where it triggered a chain reaction crash involving two Metrolink trains and a rail car.
"The defendant placed a 4000 pound Molotov cocktail on the train tracks," prosecutor Alan Jackson said.
"And he used Passenger Train 100 as the match to light the Molotov cocktail."
Alvarez's attorney, Eric Chase, maintains his client was despondent over the breakup of his marriage and had planned to kill himself but not anyone else when he parked on the tracks.
"The gasoline simply assured that death would be quicker and more painless," said Chase, who claimed that his client tried to drive his Jeep off the tracks but got stuck.
But prosecutors say he set out to cause a major catastrophe in order to garner attention and win back the sympathy of his estranged wife.
The man accused of causing a collision of two commuter trains that killed 11 people and injured nearly 200 pleaded not guilty Thursday to murder and arson charges.
Juan Manuel Alvarez, 26, allegedly parked his Jeep on tracks in suburban Glendale early Jan 26, then abandoned the vehicle as a Metrolink train approached.
The train crashed into the Jeep and derailed, slamming into an oncoming train.
Glendale police have said that while it initially appeared Alvarez was trying to commit suicide, the discovery of other evidence, including gasoline doused on the sport utility vehicle, showed he was trying to cause the crash.
Alvarez faces 11 counts of murder and one count of arson.
He appeared in court briefly Thursday and was scheduled to return July 22 for a pretrial hearing.
Special circumstance allegations could result in the death penalty if Alvarez is convicted, but prosecutors say they haven't decided whether to seek a death sentence.
Metrolink has sued the man whose aborted suicide attempt is blamed for last week's deadly train derailment, a strategy that experts said might be a way to fend off lawsuits from victims and strengthen its legal position.
The lawsuit, filed in Burbank Superior Court two days after the collision, claimed negligence, carelessness and recklessness by Juan Manual Alvarez in parking his SUV on the train tracks and causing 11 deaths and injuries to about 180.
"It's a standard filing that we make whenever we have an incident where we've suffered damage to our property we believe as a result of another's actions," said Metrolink spokesman Francisco Oaxaca.
Metrolink does not cite a monetary figure in the suit.
Metrolink has not yet assessed the full extent of the damages, but each rail car costs between $3 million and $3.5 million and each locomotive is about $4 million, Oaxaca said.
Six cars and two locomotives involved in the wreck.
Tracks can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to repair, he said.
Alvarez has been charged with murder with special circumstances making the death penalty a possibility in the crash deaths.
Investigators said that a distraught Alvarez, intending to kill himself, parked his Jeep Grand Cherokee on the train tracks in Glendale.
But when the train approached, he changed his mind and jumped out of the car.
When southbound Train No. 100 smashed into the SUV, it derailed, rammed a parked Union Pacific freight train and collided with another Metrolink train heading north out of Union Station.
Legal experts said the filing could simply be part of the process to get more information on Alvarez or to discourage lawsuits from passengers or victims' families who live outside the state.
"This could be another way for Metrolink to be protecting itself," said Jonathan Zasloff, law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.
'If they have already started a lawsuit concerning this accident in California, it is much less likely that one of the victims of this accident can sue them in another court, either in another part of California or in another state."
The suit also could be a public relations move by Metrolink, which likely will be the target of numerous lawsuits from the worst crash in its 12 year history.
"I think it's clearly strategic, because this guy can't pay a lot of damages, so the stated reason of the suit is not the reason of the suit," said Gregory Keating, law professor at the University of Southern California.
"I assume one dimension of it is public relations, because the public will get the message that Alvarez is to blame for the accident."
Metrolink officials have said their policy has a $4 million deductible and the agency has a reserve fund of $2 million to $3 million to cover its deductibles.
Metrolink has put up a stiff fight against lawsuits brought by 19 injured passengers and the family of a Santa Clarita woman who died after a 2003 wreck in Burbank, according to the plaintiffs' attorney.
In that case, a motorist drove around a barrier and across the tracks as the train approached, causing the crash that killed one and rendered a Newhall attorney a paraplegic.
Neither Glendale police nor Oaxaca were able to confirm if Alvarez had car insurance, but even if he did, it is unlikely it would cover the damages Metrolink would be seeking.
"I'm not aware of any auto policy that would come close to meeting the threshold that would be involved in something like this," said Pete Moraga, spokesman for Insurance Information Network of California, which represents the property casualty insurance industry.
Teresa Nance, daughter of victim Elizabeth Hill, 65, said Metrolink is simply trying to shift its liability onto Alvarez.
"He doesn't have anything.
This is just so he could be considered liable as opposed to Metrolink in case anybody brought suit against them," Nance said.
She said she has not thought about filing suit against Metrolink.
"I don't see suing him would do any good.
There's nothing to gain there.
I think they're just doing that to try to pawn the responsibility off on what they did."
Oaxaca did not want to respond to Nance's comment, only saying, "I can understand her reaction.
But this filing has nothing to do with anyone involved on those two trains."
Wednesday's deadly train derailment in Glendale has renewed concerns of train engineers and safety experts that it is unsafe for locomotives to push rather than pull train cars along a track, leaving passengers in lighter weight "cab cars" most exposed in the event of a crash.
That was the case Wednesday when a Metrolink train smashed into a Jeep Cherokee, with the train being led by a 57 ton cab car and powered from behind by a locomotive more than twice as heavy.
"If a locomotive had hit that Jeep Cherokee, it wouldn't have derailed and hit another train, and you wouldn't have 11 people dead," said Bob Tucker, a railroad industry consultant in Amarillo, Texas.
Tim Smith, California state chairman of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, said the union has been complaining about the practice for years.
"We feel our engineers (in cab cars) are very vulnerable to injury and death, and so are the passengers who sit right behind them.
Cab cars tend to run into things and over things and derail, where locomotives tend to shove things off the track," said Smith, who said the union's warnings have gone unheeded.
That's because regulators and passenger rail lines, including Amtrak and Caltrain in the Bay Area, believe the practice is safe.
"There's no strong or clear evidence that indicates one method of operation is less safe than another," said Steve Kulm, spokesman for the Federal Railroad Administration, which issued passenger rail safety standards in 1999.
The cab cars in the Metrolink crash were manufactured in 1993, before the regulations took effect.
The Federal Railroad Administration does not keep statistics comparing injuries and deaths in collisions in trains led by cab cars versus those led by locomotives.
But a 1996 administration study looking at the impact of a head on crash between a locomotive and cab car found that above 35 mph, occupants in the cab car likely would suffer severe injury or fatality.
The study also noted the concern that "occupants of the relatively exposed cab car, including the engineer, are vulnerable to serious injury or fatality in the event of a collision with either a road vehicle at a grade crossing or with another train."
Still, the configuration is commonplace for commuter rail lines, and has been in use since the 1950s because it allows trains to zip back and forth between destinations without using the time and space it takes to turn the locomotive around or the expense of running a locomotive at both the front and back of the train.
With the locomotive in back, the engineer controls the train from the cab car, a modified passenger car.
Caltrain spokeswoman Jayme Maltbie Kunz said the railroad has not had problems with the cab forward, or "push pull," configuration.
"We have seen no reduction in safety to our passengers operating in a push pull configuration," said Maltbie Kunz.
She said cab cars struck a Coca Cola truck in 1999 and the vehicle of a suicidal man in October and neither collision caused a derailment or serious injury to passengers or engineers.
In the case of the soda truck, bottles and cans flew through the windows of the cab car and pelted passengers.
George Elsmore, head of railroad operations and safety for the California Public Utilities Commission, agreed that the train's configuration makes little difference.
"The relative safety between the two modes is practically identical on a crash worthiness basis," Elsmore said in a Wednesday interview.
He said both cab cars and locomotives have similar federally mandated crash protection standards and devices mounted on the front to deflect objects.
But that's not enough to assuage the fears of Berkeley resident Peter Hinckley, an Amtrak engineer for 30 years who conducts trains from Oakland to Bakersfield and Sacramento.
He began operating in push pull mode about two years ago.
"I'm surprised it hasn't happened years ago," he said of a crash like the one in Glendale.
"I have hit heavy equipment, locomotive first," he said.
In a cab car, he said, "we would have been all over the landscape."
Hinckley said Amtrak is aware of the danger but will not make changes.
Amtrak spokeswoman Sarah Swain declined to respond, beyond saying the cab forward configuration is "common practice on passenger railroads in general."
Juan Manuel Alvarez, the suicidal man accused of killing 11 people and injuring more than 180 when he parked his Jeep Grand Cherokee in front of a speeding Metrolink train, appeared bandaged and shackled in court Friday as his lawyer argued that he was the victim of a "lynch mob mentality."
Alvarez, 25, who could face the death penalty, has remained heavily sedated and under suicide watch at County USC Medical Center since the accident, according to defense lawyer Eric Chase.
On Friday, he stood with a bowed head and muttered a quick "yes sir" to court officials when asked if he agreed to postpone his arraignment until medical and psychological tests could be performed on him.
While Glendale, Calif.'s Police chief has described him as being "deranged" and Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley said his despondence is no excuse of leniency, Chase suggested to reporters that the severity of the charges against him were being driven by emotion.
"I'm sensing a mentality out there that I almost want to call a lynch mob mentality.
But I'm hoping that that calms down," Chase said.
Prosecutors charged that Alvarez intended to commit suicide but chickened out as a southbound Metrolink train bore down on him.
He tried to drive away, but the vehicle was stuck, and he leapt to safety seconds before the train struck.
The train derailed, and hit another Metrolink train and an idle freight train.
The charges include special circumstance accusations of train wrecking and multiple murder, which could bring the death penalty.
Meanwhile, railroad crews worked throughout the rainy day and night Friday, removing mangled train cars and pounding temporary rails into place at the sight of the derailment, "We want to have it up and running Saturday morning for freight service and Monday morning for regular service," said Mike McGinley, Metrolink's director of engineering.
Nineteen of the njured passengersremained hospitalized, four in critical condition.
At Glendale Adventist Hospital, Louis McAleer, 39, was recovering from knee and ankle injuries.
An electrical supervisor for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the 39 year old McAleer said he was in the lead car of the train that struck the SUV abandoned on the tracks.
McAleer was hurled about the car as it slewed off the tracks and struck two other trains.
He said he often had imagined what it would be like if his train derailed, but his imagination never came close to the reality.
"It was so much worse," McAleer said.
"The abruptness, the sounds, the smells the quick impact.
I'm lucky to be alive."
McAleer said he has strong feelings about Alvarez.
"He should have just stayed on the tracks without his truck," McAleer said.
"That would have fixed everything.
I have no remorse for him.
What he did is just wrong.
Leaving a car on the tracks so that it derails a passenger train is just wrong."
On Thursday and Friday, two dozen Metrolink employees and about 60 contractors removed debris from twisted and damaged railway tracks and hoisted derailed train cars onto the tracks for removal.
One of the cars was hauled away by flatbed truck and stored as evidence for the Glendale Police Department.
Crews also were working to tear up damaged rails and replace them with temporary ones.
About 400 feet of rail will be replaced and packed into place with gravel.
Until longer, permanent rails are re installed a month from now, trains will have to slow to 35 mph at the site.
With permanent rails, trains can travel up to 70 mph.
Workers also must repair a signal bridge.
While the tracks are owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and maintained by Metrolink, Union Pacific uses them as well.
"The Union Pacific runs a fair amount of trains on this line, and there is not an alternate route," Pederson said.
Times staff writers Amanda Covarrubias, Richard Winton, Caitlin Liu and Patricia Ward Biederman contributed to this report.
Prosecutors have decided to seek the death penalty against the man accused of causing a collision of two commuter trains, a crash that killed 11 people and injured nearly 200.
Juan Manuel Alvarez, 26, allegedly parked his Jeep on tracks in suburban Glendale on Jan 26, then abandoned the vehicle as a Metrolink train approached.
The train crashed into the Jeep and derailed, slamming into an oncoming train.
Glendale police have said that while it initially appeared Alvarez was trying to commit suicide, the discovery of other evidence, including gasoline doused on the sport utility vehicle, showed he was trying to cause the crash.
Alvarez has pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of murder and one count of arson.
Eleven members of the Los Angeles County district attorney's capital case committee agreed this week to use a rarely used "train wrecking" statute as one of the special circumstance allegations against Alvarez, spokeswoman Jane Robison said Friday.
She declined to discuss what led the committee to seek the death penalty.
"We don't comment on any proceedings at the committee meetings," she said.
Alvarez's defense attorney, Eric Chase, did not immediately return a telephone message requesting comments.
The authorities now believe that the man who parked his truck on a rail line last month intended to cause the deadly train wreck that resulted and was not suicidal, as they had initially surmised.
The police in Glendale, the Los Angeles suburb where the wreck occurred on Jan 26, said this week that the man, Juan M. Alvarez believed he would get his estranged wife's attention by causing a catastrophic accident.
Eleven people died and 180 were injured after Alvarez, 25, abandoned his Jeep Cherokee on railroad tracks during the morning rush hour.
The vehicle was hit by a Metrolink commuter train headed for downtown Los Angeles.
The train derailed and sideswiped another train.
The authorities said at the time that Alvarez, despondent over familial discord, had been planning to commit suicide, but that he had lost his nerve and ran from his Jeep as he saw the train approach.
After investigating the case further, however, the Glendale police chief, Randy Adams, said that Alvarez fully intended to cause a major accident, and that taking his own life was not part of the plan.
"Although first impressions led us to believe Mr Alvarez was attempting to commit suicide, the investigation has revealed that his actions are not consistent with that of an individual who is attempting to follow through with that act," Adams said.
"Although Mr Alvarez may have contemplated suicide, his actions were deliberate with the intent of causing a horrific tragedy," he said.
Adams said Alvarez had poured gasoline on the Cherokee, apparently with the intention of seeing it go up in a ball of fire.
The lead detective on the case, Lt. Jon Perkins, told reporters that Alvarez had been asked what he thought would occur when a train collided with a vehicle in that situation.
"He basically stated that he thought there would be an explosion," Perkins said.
Investigators believe that Alvarez sought to gain notice from his wife, Carmelita, who had obtained a restraining order against him.
Shortly after the accident, Alvarez described her husband as an insecure man who believed himself incapable of providing for his family.
Alvarez's lawyer, Eric A. Chase, said in an interview Friday that the Glendale police were "trying to poison the jury pool" by accusing Alvarez of deliberately causing the wreck.
Chase, who insisted that his client was suicidal, also disputed the police chief's assertion that Alvarez poured gasoline on the Jeep.
"He poured the gasoline on himself," Chase said.
"The police found gasoline soaked clothing at his home."
Chase said his client expected "that the train would blow through the car," and had no idea that the train which was being pushed by a locomotive engine, not pulled would leave the tracks.
"How was he supposed to know that the train was in this funky configuration?"
Chase asked.
In a statement issued by his office, Chase said that the statements by the Glendale police were "not only vicious and callous but are a reckless distortion of the facts."
Earlier this week, Alvarez, who is being held without bail, pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of murder.
His next court appearance will be at preliminary hearing on March 16, when a judge will consider if there is enough evidence to send him to trial.
It had not been a perfect marriage, but at times it had been a good one.
Juan Manuel Alvarez met Carmelita Ochoa when they were teen agers, when they were members of a community dance group.
She was pregnant with another man's child.
He said he didn't care.
He loved her and her daughter their daughter, he called her anyway.
They dated for two years before Carmelita asked him to marry her.
Their wedding in 2000 was held Nov 2, Dia de los Muertos the day of the dead, a traditional Mexican holiday.
They had a son of their own and moved to a small, tidy house owned by Carmelita's parents on a quiet street in Compton.
Alvarez worked construction jobs to support his family.
"He was very good to me," his wife remembers.
But a year ago, something in Juan began to change.
He'd hurt his left arm on a job and couldn't work.
He stayed home with the children while Carmelita worked as a waitress.
He was depressed, Carmelita thought.
He began to slip away, she said, taking drugs, talking crazy.
A few months ago, his behavior became so erratic and threatening that she threw him out of their house.
She got a restraining order that prevented him from seeing his 6 year old stepdaughter and 3 year old son.
As she told a court in her oft misspelled petition, "Juan Alvarez has been using drugs for a very long time, and has started halusinating.
He accusses me of being with other people, or recording us or him in our bedroom with hidden cameras.
He also accusses me of doing porn videos with different people.
He has treatened me and says that my family members have introdused me to a boyfriend, wich is made up by him.
He has treatened to kill this person that dosn't exist, and to my family members that he thinks has introduced me.
He has treatened to do anything if I don't let him see our kids."
Was Juan Alvarez delusional, or diabolical?
Did he intend to kill only himself or many others?
In the aftermath of an enormous tragedy, justice will hinge on the answers.
Waiting on the Tracks A light rain fell in the predawn dark on the morning of Jan 26 as Juan Alvarez drove his green Jeep Cherokee through Atwater Village, a neighborhood straddling the Los Angeles Glendale line near Griffith Park.
At the railroad crossing on Chevy Chase Drive, police say, he turned sharply and drove along the tracks, stopping parallel to a giant Costco store.
At that point, he allegedly turned the vehicle so that its engine block was positioned across the tracks.
Then, police say, he waited.
From the north, a commuter train filled with people on their way to work downtown bore down on the Jeep.
Pushed from the rear by a locomotive, the train's lead car smashed into Alvarez's vehicle and drove it down the track.
First came the boom of the collision, then a scraping, groaning, metallic rumble as the first of the passenger cars derailed, turned on its side and slid along the gravel.
Then came a second collision, this one as the front car plowed into a Union Pacific freight car parked on a siding.
The impact knocked the 50 ton Union Pacific car on its side.
The commuter train, Metrolink No. 100, came to rest in a ragged, jackknifed position, its cars splayed across two sets of tracks.
The metal exterior of the first car had been sheared open like a can hacked with a claw hammer.
Now a second commuter train entered the chaos.
In a freakish bit of timing, Metrolink No. 901 came chugging toward the scene from the south just as the first chain reaction collisions began.
The jackknifed section of No. 100 clipped No. 901's second car as it rolled past.
This impact derailed 901's rear two cars.
Inside 901's second car, John Phipps, who had been dozing, was thrown violently forward.
He hit something hard, which tore a gash in his head and slammed him into unconsciousness.
For a few moments, an eerie silence settled over the scene.
The mist fell on the crumpled cars and the people trapped and hurting within.
Then the cries of pain and shouts for help began.
The chain reaction crash of the Metrolink trains killed 11 people and injured 180.
It was the worst train wreck of any kind in America in six years, and one of the deadliest ever intentionally caused.
The dead included office workers, government administrators, a stock clerk and a cop.
Julia Bennett, 44, was a clerk typist with the Los Angeles Fire Department whose father and grandfather had been firefighters.
Manuel D. Alcala, who was 51, was a maintenance worker at the county jail.
A conductor on No. 100, Thomas M. Ormiston, was 58, two years away from retirement after a career with Southern Pacific, Amtrak and Metrolink.
Scott McKeown, 42, a telecommunications manager for the city of Pasadena, was a train buff who belonged to a local model railroad club and collected train whistles.
According to news accounts of the crash, one of the victims profusely thanked the people, including workers from the Costco store, who rushed to the scene to pull him from the train.
Police later identified that victim as McKeown.
For law enforcement officials, the crash was both horrifying and personal.
Among those killed was James Tutino, a 47 year old Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy and father of four who was on his way to work at the Men's Central Jail.
For a while, as he lay pinned in the wreckage, Phipps thought he would die, too.
And so, in pain and isolation, he wrote one brief thought with the only instrument handy: the blood of his wounds.
"I (heart) my kids," he scrawled on the back of a seat.
"I (heart) Leslie," his wife's name.
Juan Alvarez almost certainly would have died in the crash, too, had he stayed in the Jeep.
But he did not.
Moments before the train struck, according to Glendale police investigators, Alvarez scrambled out of the front seat and walked back to Chevy Chase Drive.
From there, he allegedly watched the ghastly scene unfold.
At some point, perhaps before the crash, possibly after, Alvarez found a pair of scissors and slashed his arms and chest.
He walked back to his apartment a few blocks away, covered in blood.
Alarmed by his injuries, his landlady called paramedics, who grew suspicious and summoned police.
Alvarez was arrested as he was being treated.The first reports said Alvarez wanted to end his life on the tracks that morning but thought better of it and fled.
Glendale Police Chief Randy Adams called Alvarez "deranged (and) suicidal" at a news conference after the crash.
Authorities placed Alvarez on round the clock watch in his cell.
And that is the version of the wreck that Juan Alvarez's family still believes.
"He was there, and out of nowhere he basically saw a light," says Carmelita Alvarez, who has visited her husband in jail.
"Not the light from the train.
He said he felt like there was a presence from God telling him to get away."
Sitting next to her, Beto Alvarez, Juan's cousin, adds, "It was telling him to get out,He felt like somebody physically pulled him away."
Carmelita: "He tried to move the car.
But his car had a lot of mechanical problems.
It got caught and wouldn't move."
But investigators now think differently.
Days after the crash, forensic tests revealed a dramatic new piece of evidence: the presence of gasoline on the inside and outside of Alvarez's crushed Jeep Cherokee.
Glendale police, who are leading the investigation, say they have witnesses who saw Alvarez douse the car with gas.
They also say they have statements from Alvarez admitting as much.
This sheds a new light on the original suicide theory.
Alvarez wasn't trying to kill himself, says Sgt. Tom Lorenz, a police spokesman.
"He may have thought about committing suicide, but his actions are not consistent with that," he said.
"When you're contemplating suicide, would you light yourself on fire?
How many people kill themselves that way?
Why not lie down on the tracks?
Why would you walk away and watch the train hit your car?"
The self inflicted wounds on Alvarez's arms and chest, he said, "weren't life threatening."
Police now think Alvarez's intention was to derail the train in the most spectacular fashion possible.
The motive wasn't necessarily murder, says Lorenz, but mayhem.
And to what possible end?
Lorenz has a ready answer: "He was trying to gain the attention of his wife.
He wanted her back."
Suicide Attempt Looking back on it now, Juan Alvarez's relatives say they could see early signs of his clouded mind.
Los Angeles The man suspected of causing the deadliest U.S. train wreck in six years was charged with murder Thursday as the district attorney contradicted police and suggested the crash may have been a calculated act, not the work of someone insane or suicidal.
The 25 year old suspect, Juan Manuel Alvarez, was expected to be arraigned today on 11 counts of murder with special circumstances, meaning he would be eligible for the death penalty if convicted.
Alvarez has been in custody since Wednesday morning after, according to police, he drove his Jeep Cherokee SUV onto railroad tracks in Glendale shortly before 6 a.m. and then ran from the vehicle as a Metrolink commuter train bore down in the early morning darkness.
The impact caused a chain of collisions and derailments involving a freight locomotive and another Metrolink train traveling in the opposite direction, killing 11 people and injuring nearly 200 others.
The Los Angeles County district attorney, Steve Cooley, said Thursday that he had deep doubts about comments by some law enforcement officials that Alvarez was deranged or insane.
He criticized the police statements and suggested that Alvarez may have calculated his actions to send a message, perhaps to his estranged wife.
"Nothing about the facts leads us to this conclusion to suggest insanity, in spite of some people using those terms," Cooley said.
"They're using the terms in a very loose way.
They're probably uninformed about all the details of this case."
Details will emerge soon, Cooley said, "that will shed more light on what was going on in his head, as to what his intentions were."
Cooley said that a " few things are under investigation that don't suggest" Alvarez was acting in an insane manner and that his acts might have had a design, which Cooley declined to describe in detail.
On Wednesday, Glendale Police Chief Randy Adams called Alvarez suicidal and "deranged," saying that he had slashed his wrists and chest, then parked on the tracks.
Adams said Alvarez apparently lost his nerve and fled his vehicle shortly before it was rammed by the train.
He was detained shortly afterward.
Prosecutors filed 10 counts of murder against Alvarez on Thursday and then said they would add an additional charge to account for an eleventh body discovered later in the wreckage.
The charges allege special circumstances, which means that Alvarez would be eligible for the death penalty or life in prison without parole if convicted.
It could be months before prosecutors decide what sentence to seek, Cooley said.
Attorney Eric Chase, a criminal lawyer who has commented on high profile cases such as the Scott Peterson murder trial for television shows and newspapers, said Thursday he would represent Alvarez.
He declined further comment other than to say his client would probably appear in court today.
Because of his medical condition, Alvarez was not able to attend an arraignment that had been scheduled for Thursday afternoon, authorities said.
Sgt. Tom Lorenz, a spokesman for the Glendale Police Department, said that it now appeared that Alvarez, who was in stable condition in a hospital jail ward, had not slashed his wrists, as originally reported by investigators.
He has non life threatening stab wounds to his upper torso, Lorenz said, and it is not certain the wounds were self inflicted.
"That is still under investigation," Lorenz said.
As the questions emerged over what motivated Alvarez, new details were disclosed about his troubled personal life.
Alvarez' estranged wife, Carmelita Alvarez, obtained a restraining order against him in December after filing court papers saying her husband had a serious drug problem, was hallucinating and claiming falsely that she had lovers.
She also alleged that he had threatened to abduct their 31/2 year old son, Isaac.
And she said he had threatened to kill her brother, Ruben Ochoa, who Alvarez claimed had introduced her to a lover.
Her assertions were not contested by her husband, so his own side the story was not provided in the 31 pages of documents, and her descriptions of the problems were terse.
Carmelita Alvarez, who said her husband was unemployed, alleged that at one point the talked of buying a gun.
She described herself as emotionally traumatized, although she said he had caused no physical injuries and that she had not called the police despite a string of traumatizing encounters.
The wreck was the worst U.S. rail tragedy since March 15, 1999 when an Amtrak train hit a truck and derailed, also killing 11.
The laborer charged with triggering the deadly Metrolink derailment was making a "twisted" attempt to win back his estranged wife not trying to commit suicide when he abandoned his SUV on the tracks, police said Thursday.
Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, deliberately parked his Jeep Grand Cherokee on the tracks and doused both the exterior and interior of his car with gasoline, planning to create a "spectacular" scene to gain his wife's sympathy, Glendale police Lt. Jon Perkins said in an interview.
"He had a number of choices to make.
He could have torched himself, laid on the tracks, put the car on the tracks, but he didn't choose any of those.
We believe that this was nothing more than an attention getting model to have his wife take him back.
"I don't think he ever intended to kill himself."
During Alvarez's arraignment on Tuesday, prosecutors added arson charges to the 11 counts of murder with special circumstances already filed against the Compton man.
He pleaded not guilty.
"It was a deliberate act with total disregard for anybody else," Perkins said in providing new details of the Jan 26 crash that killed 11 people and injured nearly 200 others.
"He only had a selfish motivation in mind.
It was his twisted way of gaining sympathy from his wife."
Police would not say whether Alvarez called his wife before or after crash.
However, detectives said while he was in the hospital he continually asked if his wife was there.
"He was concerned to know if his wife was at the hospital and if this incident brought her to see him," said Detective Bob Breckenridge.
Alvarez's attorney, Eric Chase, released a statement criticizing the police for their comments.
"The statements of Glendale police today are not only vicious and callous but are a reckless distortion of the facts," he said.
"If they want to make this case about, as they say, 'Juan Alvarez's intent to cause a horrific tragedy,' I hope they can back it up."
The District Attorney's Office refused to comment.
Witnesses told police they saw Alvarez park his SUV parallel to the tracks, then pour a liquid investigators have since detected gasoline on the wreckage from a plastic container on its hood and roof.
Moments later, the SUV was parked with its front wheels on the track and Alvarez on the passenger side with the door open.
He was then seen "engaged in some type of activity" inside the Cherokee until he saw the train coming, Perkins said.
"When the train started approaching, he started running," Perkins said.
Authorities have said that Alvarez was horrified when he saw the crash and ran to a friend's house in nearby Atwater Village.
He stabbed at his wrists and chest with scissors, which led to early speculation that the crash was the result of an aborted suicide attempt.
Two days after the crash, Metrolink filed suit against Alvarez, claiming his actions caused the derailment of a southbound commuter train.
It collided with a parked Union Pacific locomotive, then crashed into a northbound Metrolink train.
Rita Tutino, whose husband, Los Angeles sheriff's Deputy James Tutino, died in the crash, filed a claim earlier this week, claiming Metrolink was negligent in its management and operation of the commuter line.
In a phone interview Thursday, Rita Tutino said that whatever his intent, Alvarez knew that placing his car on the tracks would endanger the lives of hundreds of people.
"Why didn't he just go buy her roses?
Why didn't he write her a letter?
Why didn't he go get help?
You don't put at risk the lives of hundreds of people," she said.
"I'm one of 11 families that lost a family member.
"It's utterly ridiculous whether he's trying to kill himself or trying to get the attention of his wife."
Perkins said investigators are working with prosecutors to prove that Alvarez's actions were not influenced by mental illness.
Juan Miguel Alvarez, charged with murder with special circumstances in the deaths of 11 Metrolink passengers, slashed and stabbed himself after seeing the horrific train crash he caused, sources close to the investigation said Thursday.
Alvarez, 25, despondent over the breakup of his marriage, had planned to kill himself when he drove his green Jeep Grand Cherokee in the path of a Metrolink train, officials said, but he bolted from the vehicle at the last moment.
As he watched, southbound Train No. 100 smashed into the SUV and derailed, then rammed a parked Union Pacific freight train and collided with another Metrolink train heading north out of Union Station.
As onlookers and emergency crews rushed to help those trapped in the flaming wreckage, Alvarez walked to a female friend's home in nearby Atwater Village, where he slashed his wrists and stabbed himself in the chest, the sources said.
"Now that we have done further investigation, we know the self inflicted wounds were received after he placed the car on the tracks and after he fled from the scene," one source said.
"When paramedics responded, that's how we became aware of his location."
Alvarez appeared remorseful, sources said, making spontaneous statements about the crash to paramedics and law enforcement officials who responded to the friend's 911 call.
Eleven people died and about 180 were injured in the crash at 6:02 a.m. Wednesday.
Seven people remained in critical condition on Thursday.
Within hours of the crash, Alvarez was arrested on suspicion of murder.
He is being held without bail at Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center jail ward, where he is being treated for the self inflicted wounds.
Alvarez was charged early Thursday with 10 counts of murder with the special circumstances of multiple murders and murder caused by train derailment, an extremely rare charge.
After the body of an 11th victim was discovered, District Attorney Steve Cooley said another murder count would be added to the complaint.
The special circumstances could make Alvarez eligible for the death penalty if he is convicted, but Cooley said he hadn't yet decided whether to pursue the capital charges.
The Alvarez family retained attorney Eric A. Chase of the Chase Law Group in Studio City to represent him.
Chase and fellow attorney Debra S. White said they expect Alvarez's arraignment, originally scheduled for Thursday, to be held Friday.
In filing the charges, Cooley said he was unmoved by Alvarez's emotional state before the crash.
"He's not going to engage my sympathy because he was despondent," Cooley said.
"The special circumstances alleged could lead to the death penalty but only after a careful evaluation of all the facts and circumstances that related to the particular incident.
We're all aware of Mr Alvarez's background."
But legal observers predicted Cooley will have a hard time getting a conviction on the special circumstances allegations because he would have to prove that Alvarez intended to kill people on the train.
Statements by law enforcement officials that the train crash was the result of an aborted suicide attempt don't support that notion, they said.
"It suggests to me that he didn't have an intent to kill," said Elyn Saks, a professor of law, psychology and psychiatry in behavioral sciences at the University of Southern California School of Law.
"On the other hand, just putting the car there on the tracks was extremely reckless."
Saks said prosecutors might do better to charge Alvarez with "depraved heart" murder, the equivalent of second degree murder, rather than more serious first degree charges.
Attorneys also said statements made by Sheriff Lee Baca, Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn and others that Alvarez was "deranged" and a "crazed individual" will not help defense attorneys in a possible insanity defense to spare him a potential death sentence.
James E. Blatt, a high profile criminal defense attorney based in Encino, said it seemed obvious that Alvarez was mentally ill and disabled, but that there was a much higher standard concerning an insanity defense.
"He did have enough wherewithal to jump out of the way of the train to preserve his life," Blatt said.
"He appears remorseful.
And at first blush, he appears to understand the consequences of his actions."
As grieving friends and families mourned the deaths of their loved ones, city, state and federal investigators continued to comb through the massive pile of debris and twisted metal at the scene.
"It's been an extremely long and difficult two days with the rescue and recovery of victims in this tragic accident," Glendale police Sgt. Tom Lorenz said.
"All emergency personnel working through these tough times are not only trying to get victims reunited with their loved ones, but at the back of their minds know they have fellow employees who were injured or died.
"We want to make sure we do a very thorough job."
The National Transportation Safety Board has assigned 10 investigators to assist the Glendale Police Department.
"They will spend the next few weeks looking at documenting different aspects of the event like the crash worthiness of the (rail) cars and survivability issues like how people were injured and what might be done to protect them better," agency spokesman Paul Schlamm said.
"We're trying to learn as much as we can from this."
Ten people were killed and more than 100 injured Wednesday when two commuter trains slammed into each other after one of them hit a car left on the lines by a suicidal man, police said.
A murder investigation was launched as the death toll rose following the horrific early morning crash involving three trains and a sports utility vehicle in the heavily populated Los Angeles suburb of Glendale.
Rescuers were picking through the mangled wreckage of the trains that collided with an explosive crash just after 6:00 am (1400 GMT) after one of them derailed as it ploughed into the abandoned vehicle.
"We have 10 fatalities so far and well over 100 injured," Glendale Police Chief Randy Adams told reporters, adding that the probe into the accident had turned into a homicide investigation.
"This whole incident was started by a deranged individual who was suicidal," he said announcing that the depressed driver, identified as Juan Manuel Alvarez, 26, was unhurt and was in custody.
The driver allegedly manoeuvred his Jeep onto the tracks, where it became stuck, and waited for a train to end his life, according to Adams and other police officials.
"He was intent at that time on taking his own life but changed his mind," Adams told reporters.
"He exited the vehicle and stood by as a southbound Metrolink train struck his vehicle, causing the train to derail and strike the northbound train," the police chief said.
After hitting the car, the packed rush hour train, which was bound for Los Angeles' Union Station, jumped its tracks and jack knifed into the path of an oncoming commuter train heading in the opposite direction.
One of the stricken trains then side swiped a stationary freight train that was parked on a side track in the area, knocking it over, officials said.
Carnage ensued.
"It sounded like thunder," said Karen Mendoza, an employee at a nearby wholesale store who called emergency services when she heard the accident.
Some passengers had to be cut from the wreckage, which was strewn over a wide area, while others were forced to jump to safety from the burning upper decks of railway carriages that caught fire in the impact.
At least 89 people were rushed to hospital as a hundreds of rescuers and convoys of ambulances flooded the crash scene.
Some 200 people, mostly walking wounded, were examined by medical staff at the scene as they prioritised treatment for the wounded, firefighters said.
Passengers were tossed around the inside of their trains and some had to jump from the upper decks of the wreckage, eyewitnesses told reporters.
Most of the injuries suffered by victims were "crush type" wounds similar to those that occur in car crashes, said Carol Meyer of the Los Angeles County emergency medical services.
Many of the patients had head, chest and abdominal injuries, she added.
The Los Angeles Police Department declared a citywide tactical alert that allows commanders to keep officers on the job beyond the end of their shifts, in order to help with the rescue and crowd control operations.
Meanwhile the driver of the vehicle that sparked the incident was expected to be charged with murder, police said.
"You don't put your car on the track and put yourself in harm's way and all these passengers in harm's way," said Los Angeles Sheriff Lee Baca, one of whose deputies was among the dead.
"This is a complete outrage."
A 25 year old man was arrested following Wednesday's commuter train collision that killed at least 10 people near downtown Los Angeles.
Glendale Police Chief Randy Adams said Juan Manuel Alvarez, who intentionally parked his Jeep on the rail tracks and caused the train collision, will be facing at least 10 counts of homicide.
A southbound commuter train from Ventura County struck the Jeep at about 6 a.m. local time and caromed into a stationary freight train locomotive before colliding with a northbound commuter train from Union Station in downtown Los Angeles.
At least 10 people were killed and hundreds were hurt in the crash that also disrupted morning rush hour commuter train traffic.
Alvarez, who is on the suicide watch list, drove his Jeep Cherokee on the tracks, then changed his mind about taking his life and fled from the vehicle when the train was approaching.
Adams said Alvarez had made some superficial attempts overnight to kill himself slitting his wrists and stabbing his chest and was treated for those wounds before being booked.
According to police records, Alvarez has a previous arrest history, possibly involving drugs.
"He has been cooperative and he has talked to our investigators, " Adams said.
Alvarez is accused of leaving a Jeep Cherokee on the tracks, causing the derailment of one train, which then crashed into another.
Until Wednesday, Juan Manuel Alvarez was living the average life of an obscure and troubled man.
He has an arrest record for cocaine, a turbulent relationship with his estranged wife and a restraining order to keep away from her and their two children.
But then in the early morning darkness of Wednesday, Alvarez introduced his troubled life to the world when he drove his Jeep Cherokee onto the commuter railroad tracks of Glendale in metropolitan Los Angeles, killing at least 10 people and injuring about 200 more.
Ronald Watson came to the Glendale Police Station on Wednesday morning to find some information on his wife.
He was told she was taken to the hospital and released.
"I heard what happened this morning, and I thought it can't be her," said Watson, visibly relieved.
"It was.
Thank God nothing serious happened to her.
She's home now.
She's going to be mad I didn't pick her up."
Alvarez had apparently meant to kill himself, investigators said, but changed his mind when he saw the train barreling down on him.
When he could not get his vehicle off the tracks, he ran.
He was in police custody Wednesday evening, said to be distraught but cooperating.
"He's carrying a lot of baggage and talked about killing himself," said Sheriff Lee Baca of Los Angeles County.
"When the train came, he got scared, he couldn't go through with it.
He left his car there and instead of killing himself, he killed many innocent people."
Alvarez's motive for wanting to kill himself, according to investigators, appears to be that his estranged wife, Carmelita, would not let him see their two children.
The couple had separated three months ago, and she obtained a restraining order against Alvarez about two months ago, the police said.
Alvarez's sister in law, Maricela Amaya, told Telemundo TV that he had recently tried to see his boy and threatened to kill himself.
"He was having problems with drugs and all that and was violent, and because of that he separated from her," Amaya said in Spanish.
"A few other times he went around as if he wanted to kill himself."
After the bodies had been cleared from the wreckage, law enforcement officials began to wonder if Alvarez might have killed his family.
But, Mrs Alvarez was tracked to a modest home in the north section of Compton.
A man standing outside the family's home, who described himself as a relative, said Mrs Alvarez and the children were uninjured.
According to investigators, Alvarez spent the evening before slashing his wrists and even stabbed himself in the chest, but the wounds were superficial.
And so sometime Wednesday morning, Alvarez, 25, drove himself to the Glendale tracks, near the City of Los Angeles boundary and parked his car.
He decided not to go through with it, but the vehicle got stuck between the tracks, the police said.
Alvarez ran to safety and watched the carnage he had caused, witnesses told the police.
"He came to Glendale to commit suicide," said Bob Yousefian, mayor of Glendale, a normally uneventful city of 210000 just north of Los Angeles City Hall.
"He kind of ran, tried to hide, but because of his previous injuries, he got apprehended."
Chief Randy G. Adams of the Glendale police said he was "very confident" that he had the right man, going by Alvarez's own admissions and witnesses on the train who saw him run.
"This whole incident was started by a deranged individual that was suicidal," Adams said.
Alvarez is likely to face at least 10 counts of murder, the chief said.
Los Angeles County prosecutors on Thursday charged a man with 11 counts of murder, one for every person who died in a violent three train wreck that they say he caused by driving his Jeep onto commuter railroad tracks in a botched suicide attempt.
The charges include the special circumstances of using the train, which could make the man, Juan M. Alvarez, eligible for the death penalty.
Alvarez may also face federal charges in the train derailment.
He was to stand in court on Thursday afternoon and answer the charges, but his appearance was postponed until Friday because he was too weak from wounds he made to his wrists and chest before the wreck, prosecutors said.
Steve Cooley, the Los Angeles County district attorney, said in an interview that he would not decide whether to seek the death penalty until the case was thoroughly reviewed by his office.
His voice firm with anger, Cooley called Alvarez a self centered man whose aborted suicide attempt on the Glendale railroad crossing led to 11 deaths in the early morning darkness Wednesday.
Another 200 people were injured.
The body of one man was burned so badly it has yet to be identified.
"Because this man was distressed, 11 people are dead from his selfishness," Cooley said.
"They said he was not well enough to appear today.
Hopefully, they will patch him up so we can get this case rolling."
Alvarez, 25, was being held in a special custody ward at an area hospital.
As the diesel fuel dissipated at the crash site and the investigation became a clean up operation, a clearer portrait of Alvarez emerged.
According to investigators, Alvarez is an itinerant laborer with no fixed address.
When detectives asked him to volunteer to a search of his residence, Alvarez said he did not have one, that he had been bouncing from couch to couch since he had a falling out with his wife, Carmelita.
She filed a restraining order against him two months ago, alleging that he was prone to drug induced hysteria.
More than once, his wife said in papers filed with the court, he threatened to kidnap the couple's children, a girl, 6 and a boy, 2.
He threatened to sell his Jeep to buy a gun, promising Mrs Alvarez's brother, Ruben Ochoa, that he would be the primary target of his anger, she said.
Mr Alvarez, 25, has a history of drug arrests and violence.
He has been in and out of rehabilitation facilities over the years.
Increasingly, his behavior became more odd and paranoid, his wife said in court papers, and she said he accused her of participating in pornographic videos.
Mrs Alvarez got an order of protection against him in December, forbidding him to see his children.
Mr Alvarez began to threaten suicide to friends, investigators said.
Late Tuesday evening or early Wednesday, Mr Alvarez cut his arms and stabbed himself in the chest but the wounds were so superficial, he remained conscious.
He drove onto the railroad tracks in Glendale, not far from the Los Angeles City line.
Investigators believe that Mr Alvarez wanted to die under the wheels of the train, but when the end approached he reconsidered.
With his tire, apparently caught between the tracks, Mr Alvarez jumped out of the Jeep and ran.
"He chickened out," said Sheriff Lee Baca of Los Angeles County.
Two of Baca's employees died in the collision.
"He killed innocent people but not himself."
On Thursday, the National Transportation Safety Board said it would not conduct a full investigation of the crash because it appeared to be the result of a criminal act. "We're not doing our standard investigation which would involve determination of cause," said Paul Schlamm, a spokesman for the agency in Washington .
"We're taking a more limited role here."
He said the safety board would review data from recording devices in the locomotives, including time, speed and the exact location of the cars' breaking up.
He said investigators would also look at the extent of destruction in the commuter cars and what might be done to improve chances for survival in future accidents.
The commuter train that struck the car on Wednesday had the locomotive situated in the rear, pushing rather than pulling the passenger cars.
A federal study in 1996 showed that in this configuration, the front car is exposed, putting passengers at particular risk of injuries or death.
Mayor James K. Hahn of Los Angeles called for a complete re examination of all commuter rail lines to see if further safety measures were needed or possible after the freakish outcome to the bungled suicide.
A man intent on committing suicide left his car on a railroad track in Glendale near downtown Los Angeles Wednesday, where it set off a collision that derailed two commuter trains, killing at least 10 people and injuring nearly 200, authorities said.
Police arrested a man who they said would be charged with homicide in the crash that left train cars mangled and seared.
Debris including seat cushions, bloody towels and luggage discarded by fleeing passengers littered the area.
A southbound commuter train heading to downtown Los Angeles hit the Jeep Grand Cherokee parked on the tracks, said Glendale Police Chief Randy G. Adams.
The train then apparently crashed into a northbound Metrolink commuter train, and a stationary Union Pacific freight train was hit and knocked off the tracks, officials said.
The investigation was continuing.
Adams identified the suspect as Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, of Compton, adding that he had attempted suicide before.
Alvarez, who was identified by witnesses at the scene, was detained there and appeared to have superficial self inflicted injuries unrelated to the crash.
Distraught and remorseful, Alvarez told police he had left the vehicle and watched the derailment, Adams said.
The suspect was put on a suicide watch.
Alvarez was held on 10 counts of murder, Adams said, although formal charges are lodged by the district attorney's office.
Alvarez, who will be 26 on Feb 26, had previous drug arrests, Adams said.
It is too early to say exactly what those charges will be, District Attorney Steve Cooley said, but they could include multiple counts of murder, with special circumstances based on the number of deaths and nature of the crime.
Key to the legal case, Cooley said, "is the intent of the individual when he drove onto the tracks."
Adams said of Alvarez: "I think his intent at that time was to take his own life, but changed his mind prior to the train actually striking this vehicle.
He exited the vehicle and stood by as the southbound Metrolink train struck his vehicle, causing the train to derail and strike the northbound train."
Glendale Mayor Bob Yousefian said that Alvarez "kind of ran, tried to hide, but because of his previous injuries, he got apprehended."
When asked why Alvarez was in Glendale, the mayor responded, "He came to Glendale to commit suicide."
A National Transportation Safety Board team was headed to the scene.
The Glendale Police Department was leading the criminal investigation, with Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department assisting.
The 6 a.m. crash set off minor fires and diesel fuel spills as rescuers rushed to the scene about four miles north of Los Angeles.
"This is unbelievably tragic," Sheriff Lee Baca told reporters at the scene.
"It is a complete outrage as far as transportation safety is concerned."
At a joint news conference with Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton and Glendale's Adams, Baca said he was especially upset because one of the dead was identified as Deputy James Tutino, a 23 year veteran of the Sheriff's Department.
He was aboard the southbound train, heading to work.
Three LAPD employees were hospitalized, and one was unaccounted for, Bratton said.
By 10:30 a.m. the death count hit 10.
Fire officials said 123 people were treated and transported to 13 area hospitals.
About 60 people were treated at the scene and released.
(Begin optional trim) Glendale Memorial Hospital treated 13 passengers.
Eight were treated and released.
Two were listed in critical condition, including Theresa Gillen.
Her sister, Leah Gillen, 35, waited at the hospital for news about her sister, who works for Para Los Ninos, a social services agency in downtown Los Angeles.
Gillen lashed out at Alvarez.
"I'm angry that someone would be so selfish and would destroy the lives of so many people," Leah Gillen said.
"These people were just going to work."
(End optional trim) Hundreds of tons of wreckage from the commuter trains lay strewn across the area.
Officials reported traffic delays.
More than 300 firefighters combed through the derailed trains looking for trapped passengers in the predawn darkness.
As firefighters cleared each car, they marked the side, giving the cars an eerie look as they formed a twisted zig zag pattern next to the tracks.
At least five passes had been completed through the trains by 9 a.m., when officials said the focus shifted from rescue to recovery.
Officials said the trains usually carried 200 to 250 passengers.
The top speed is 79 mph, although the trains were believed to be traveling at less than the maximum.
David Morrison, 47, an attorney, was heading to downtown Los Angeles on his regular morning commute.
He said he got on train 100 at 5:19 a.m. in Simi Valley.
"I heard the crash.
It sounded like the train was dragging something across the tracks," he told the Los Angeles Times.
"There was a violent lurch and everything came to a stop."
He said the passengers fled amid the smell of diesel fumes.
Goddard Paialii, 53, of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, a communications electrician for the city of Los Angeles, said he boarded the train and rode in the lead car.
He was upstairs and said he was trying to nap, listening to his iPod.
After the crash, the train "appeared to be dragging whatever it hit.
At that point, I just braced myself.
Computers, seat pads, briefcases were flying all over.
There was lots of smoke in the car."
But the exodus remained orderly.
Cathie Fransen, 57, was riding with her friend Ken Milds, 55, in the middle car.
Fransen said she has taken the train regularly for 12 1/2 years and was in the aisle seat, second floor, middle car.
She does community relations for IBM in Glendale.
"It was very terrifying.
We had seconds to think about what was going on," she said.
The entire wreck of all three trains was contained between a gray warehouse and the brick wall of a Costco warehouse store.
All along the ground, large metal pieces of the side of the train and gray upholstered seats were scattered like discarded food wrappers.
On the train cars, windows gaped or were shattered in their frames.
"We heard a loud boom and the building shook," said Jenny Doll, 30, a Costco clerk.
Employees took fire extinguishers from the store shelves and ran outside to help.
Inside the store, passengers were processed by officials trying to account for everyone on board.
Once done, the commuters filed out and sat on white picnic benches in front of a snack stand.
An hour after the crash, crews worked on the wreckage as about 50 passengers waited nearby.
Staff writers Peter Hong, Jill Leovy, David Pierson, Wendy Thermos and Erica Williams contributed to this report.
Authorities believe Juan Manuel Alvarez drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee around the rail crossing barrier and onto the Metrolink train tracks at Chevy Chase Drive in Glendale about 6 a.m. Wednesday.
His intent was to kill himself, but he changed his mind after his SUV got stuck between the tracks in an area slightly away from the grade crossing.
At 6:02 a.m., the three car Train 100, headed from Moorpark to Union Station, with the locomotive in the rear, crashed into the SUV.
Instead of knocking it out of the way, the train's front cab car probably lifted up over the SUV, said Metrolink's CEO Dave Solow.
Because the SUV was "lodged on the tracks," it was unable to move, he said.
"It got wedged under the train.
At grade crossing, it would have been easier.
He would have been pushed off."
The commuter train folded up like an accordion its front car ramming into the Union Pacific freight train's locomotive on the track to the west, toppling it to its side.
The remaining cars collided with northbound Metrolink Train 901, which was on the track to the east after leaving the Glendale Station.
The Union Pacific train was a work train for track maintenance, with two locomotives and about 12 cars filled with ballast or gravel.
Metrolink trains in that area can go up to 79 mph, but officials said they were likely going slower with the Glendale station nearby.
Solow said there's little Metrolink can do to prevent suicide attempts on its tracks.
"One of the banes of our existence is we can't stop someone who wants to commit suicide."
A "deranged" man abandoned his SUV on railroad tracks when he aborted a suicide attempt, authorities said, and then watched as a Metrolink commuter train slammed into it, setting off a spectacular three train collision that left at 11 least dead and more than 180 injured Wednesday.
Shortly after 6 a.m., commuters were thrown flying through the cars and trapped beneath tons of twisted metal as the double deck rail cars toppled and flames danced around them.
After hitting the Jeep Grand Cherokee on the tracks, the front of southbound Train 100 hurtled into a Union Pacific locomotive parked on a parallel track, while its other cars swept into oncoming northbound Train 901.
Even before a massive emergency response effort was launched, nearby residents and workers rushed to help passengers, many of them dazed and bleeding as they stumbled from the wreckage.
"This is a complete outrage," Los Angeles Sheriff Lee Baca said in angry comments at a news conference.
"The people who ride trains to Los Angeles deserve better than this.
"That an individual would deliberately put their car on tracks, cause a train derailment, affect the lives of hundreds of people and, in effect, kill people, this is a tragedy we will certainly mourn."
Among the nine men and two women killed were a uniformed sheriff's deputy headed to work, several government employees and one of the conductors.
Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, of Compton, the driver of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, was found near the wreckage and arrested on suspicion of homicide.
Glendale Police Chief Randy Adams said Alvarez who officials said had tried to commit suicide earlier by slashing his wrists and cutting himself watched the chaos after fleeing his vehicle.
"This whole incident started by a deranged individual who was suicidal," Adams said.
"He was very distraught and upset and realized he caused a major disaster."
Passengers described being hurled from their seats as the trains collided, and then rescuing one another from the wreckage in the predawn dark.
A fire broke out, and 5000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled.
"People just flew out of their seats and hit the walls," said Bernan Castro, a Washington Mutual insurance agent who had boarded the southbound train in Burbank.
"We smelled the fire,It was engulfing (one fourth of) the train.
It just looked like a war zone,There was blood everywhere."
Doug Parsons of Northridge also was aboard the train, headed for his job at the Metropolitan Water District downtown.
"We were right on schedule.
Right in here, we usually pass another train.
We heard some gravel fly and then ,the big boom.
The car in front of us went sideways,That's when we saw the other train."
Tracy West of Northridge, who suffered serious cuts to her right leg, described a nightmarish scene: "I just remember flipping and flipping and flipping,My feet were over my head.
People were hurt, dripping with blood.
You just offer to help anyone you can."
On the northbound train, headed from Union Station to Burbank, Nelson Goyzueta said he watched the rail car in front of his rock back and forth on the track before toppling to the side.
"The third one did cartwheels it was way off to the side," said Goyzueta, who was on his way to work with other employees of Senior Aerospace in Burbank.
"It was mayhem."
The National Transportation Safety Board and other government agencies sent investigators.
The tracks run next to a big box shopping center anchored by a Costco, where triage was set up and store workers helped with the rescue.
Hundreds of firefighters descended on the scene within minutes of the 6:02 a.m. crash, dousing flames, spraying foam on the fuel spill and extricating wounded from the cars.
Firefighters described a horrific scene where bloodied passengers were helping each other off the train and responders could hear the cries for help.
"It was unbelievable all you could think was, 'Go in and get those people out,' " said firefighter Oscar Stokes, 38.
"There was a lot of blood."
Rescuers used extrication tools to cut out those trapped in the wreckage and shopping carts from Costco to wheel victims to triage until more gurneys arrived.
Dogs were brought in to search for survivors and cameras to probe dark crevices in the wreckage.
Dozens of paramedic trucks formed single file lines to quickly load and carry the wounded to 16 area hospitals.
They treated and transported 123 victims, including 70 in critical condition.
They assessed and released 60 others at the scene.
"It had to be the worst multicasualty incident I've been to," Los Angeles Fire Capt. Rick Godinez said.
"It was a devastating sight.
"We could see walking wounded.
We knew we had a pretty traumatic situation."
Elected officials expressed outrage at the tragedy but praised the rescue effort that reached across jurisdictions to handle the crisis.
"Words can't describe, when you look into the cars, the violence of the crash," Mayor James Hahn said at a news conference.
"It's a miracle that more people didn't die."
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger sent his own condolences and those of his wife, Maria Shriver, to the victims and survivors.
"We want to thank the 300 firefighters that rushed to the scene and are doing good action to rescue the injured people from the wreckage.
And we also want to thank the medical personnel who tended the injured."
Glendale Mayor Bob Yousefian urged the federal government to provide funding to enhance grade crossings, while expressing shock and sadness at the tragedy.
"Nothing of this magnitude has happened (before) in Glendale," he said.
"He just came to Glendale to commit suicide.
And we have no idea why he did this."
At least 10 people were killed and more than 180 injured Wednesday when a commuter train derailed after crashing into a car parked on tracks north of Los Angeles, then sideswiped an oncoming train, knocking it off its rails.
Authorities said the SUV, a Jeep Cherokee, was left on the tracks by an apparently suicidal man, who jumped from the vehicle moments before the southbound commuter train plowed into it.
It was the worst train wreck in the United States since March 1999, when an Amtrak train hit a truck and derailed in Illinois, killing 11 people and injuring about 100.
In the deadliest train wreck in recent years, an Amtrak train plunged off a railroad bridge near Mobile, Ala., in September 1993, killing 47 people.
The SUV was hit shortly after 6 a.m. Pacific time by a southbound Metrolink train, which then went off the rails and started a deadly chain reaction, authorities said.
After derailing, the commuter train, which was being pushed by its engine, struck a Union Pacific locomotive parked on a side track, knocking it onto its side, fire department officials said.
The commuter train, en route to Union Station in Los Angeles from the western suburb of Moorpark, then buckled, sideswiping a passing northbound train that was headed toward Burbank.
Diesel fuel in the locomotive caught fire as a result of the crash, and flames spread to parts of the wreckage before firefighters extinguished them.
The driver of the SUV, identified as Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, of Compton, Calif., was taken into custody, and police said he would be charged with homicide.
Further information was not available.
They said the abortive suicide attempt did not involve terrorism.
"This is a complete outrage," Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca angrily told reporters at the scene of mangled rail cars and smoking wreckage in the suburb of Glendale, north of downtown Los Angeles.
He said the driver would be held accountable.
"You don't put your car on the track and put yourself in harm's way and all these passengers in harm's way," Baca said.
Among the dead was a deputy in Baca's department who was riding the southbound train to work.
In a light drizzle, rescue workers paused to salute the flag draped stretcher carrying the body of Deputy James Tutino as it was removed from the wreckage.
"This whole incident was started by a deranged individual that was suicidal," Glendale Police Chief Randy Adams told a news conference.
"I think his intent at that time was to take his own life, but (he) changed his mind prior to the train actually striking the vehicle."
Just hours before maneuvering his car onto the tracks, Alvarez had twice tried to kill himself, slashing his wrists and stabbing himself in the chest, police said.
When those attempts failed, they said, he got into his car and headed for the tracks behind a Costco store.
Several train passengers said they saw Alvarez jump from his SUV just before the southbound train plowed into the vehicle, Adams said.
Approximately 250 people were aboard the two commuter trains traveling in opposite directions at the beginning of the morning rush hour.
Rescue workers initially thought Alvarez was a victim of the train wreck when they found him wandering near the scene, bleeding from his wrists and chest.
But he was arrested after saying he was the driver of the SUV that was struck by the train.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry," he muttered as he walked around the crash site, authorities said.
Alvarez was taken to USC Medical Center for treatment of his self inflicted wounds, and police moved to book him on 10 counts of homicide.
Adams described him as "upset, remorseful but cooperative."
The police chief said Alvarez has a criminal record involving drugs.
The force of the crash hurled passengers down the aisles and into tables as the rail cars twisted and turned before finally coming to rest.
At least one train car caught fire.
Authorities said 123 people were taken to 15 hospitals in the region and that about 40 were in critical condition.
About 60 people were treated at the scene and released.
Branigin reported from Washington.
A man whom police described as deranged and bent on suicide abandoned a light truck on a heavily traveled commuter rail track here early Wednesday, causing a violent wreck involving three trains that left at least 10 people dead and nearly 200 injured.
The fierce collision at 6:02 a.m. left rail cars toppled and crushed like oversized toys and sparked immediate fears among Los Angeles area police that the derailment was a terrorist act. A counterterrorism command post was set up near the crash site, but authorities determined within an hour that the disaster was almost certainly the work of one troubled man.
Two hours after the crash, the rain spattered scene between a Costco store and a warehouse still reeked of diesel fuel.
The tracks were covered with tons of twisted metal and littered with rail car seats, suitcases, briefcases and clothing.
A bicycle lay on its side and the gravel rail bed was stained with oil and blood.
Rescue workers arrived quickly and were aided by Costco employees who pulled injured passengers from the smoking wreckage.
More than 120 people, dozens of them with serious injuries, were transported to 15 area hospitals.
"People were screaming, one lady was crying, people were moaning, all kinds of painful noises," said Richard Mendevil, who was on his way home to Santa Clarita from Los Angeles' Union Station in the northbound Metrolink train, when it was hit by a southbound train that had derailed after hitting the light truck and an idle Union Pacific work train.
Glendale police said that Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, of the Los Angeles suburb of Compton, drove around barriers at a grade crossing and then up the Metrolink commuter rail tracks, where his Jeep Grand Cherokee became wedged between the rails.
He apparently changed his mind about killing himself, abandoned the vehicle and watched the crash, the Glendale police chief, Randy G. Adams, said.
Adams said that before driving onto the tracks Alvarez cut his wrists and stabbed himself in the chest, inflicting superficial wounds.
He was treated for his injuries and taken into custody and will be charged with at least 10 counts of murder, the chief said.
He said the crash was caused solely by the actions of the suspect.
He and other law enforcement officials expressed dismay and anger at what they called a preventable man made disaster.
"I think his intent at that time was to take his own life, but changed his mind prior to the train actually striking this vehicle," Adams said.
"He exited the vehicle and stood by as the southbound Metrolink train struck his vehicle, causing the train to derail and strike the northbound train."
He said that Alvarez was cooperating with authorities and had acknowledged causing the wreck.
"He was very distraught and upset when he realized he caused a major disaster," the chief said.
Alvarez is in jail and under suicide watch, he added.
Steve Cooley, the Los Angeles County district attorney, said he would decide by the end of the week what charges he will bring against Alvarez.
Metrolink is a commuter rail system serving five counties in Southern California since its formation in 1992.
About 40000 people ride the double decker trains every day, officials said.
The two trains that crashed on Wednesday typically carry between 230 and 300 people on weekdays.
Wednesday's crash was the deadliest train accident in the United States since March 15, 1999, when an Amtrak train hit a truck and derailed near Bourbonnais, Ill., killing 11 people.
A crash in Graniteville, S.C., earlier this month ruptured a chlorine tank, leaving nine people dead and 234 injured.
The National Transportation Safety Board has sent a team to investigate.
People on the train and in the neighborhood near the tracks saw Alvarez as he ran away from his vehicle.
Slowed by his knife wounds, he was arrested quickly, police said.
Witnesses and survivors described a horrific collision that upended several double decker rail cars and toppled a heavy diesel Union Pacific locomotive sitting idle on a side track.
"I heard a noise.
It got louder and louder," Diane Brady, 56, a passenger from Simi Valley, told the Associated Press.
"And next thing I knew the train tilted, everyone was screaming and I held onto a pole for dear life.
I held on for what seemed like a week and a half, it seemed.
It was a complete nightmare."
One injured man trapped in the wreckage scrawled a note in his own blood on a seat cushion, according to Rex Vilaubi, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman.
He wrote "I love my kids" and "I love Leslie" using the heart symbol, Vilaubi said.
He said he did not know the man's name.
Mendevil, who was in the second car of the northbound train, said the collision came with no warning.
"I was on the second floor walking down the aisle and saw the lights of the oncoming train and watched it pass and then I was thrown up in the air, landed on a table and rolled off onto the floor," he said.
"The train tilted sideways and the lights flickered and went out."
He said as he got up from the floor he saw a fire on the tracks and a man with blood streaming down his face staggering alongside the listing rail car.
Mendevil said that although he was "pretty much in panic," he pried open a door and helped a woman out and away from the train.
Mendevil, 25, was interviewed in the parking lot of the Costco store that became a command center and triage station for the crash.
He was wearing a tag around his neck given to him by paramedics to keep track of the injured.
He was treated at the scene and sent home.
Mendevil said as he walked away from the wreckage, he saw the tailgate of a truck and a wheel and concluded that the train had hit a car or truck.
"I got as far away as I could because I was worried about an explosion," he said.
Costco workers attended to the injured and used carts that usually haul plywood to carry the injured to ambulances when paramedics ran out of gurneys.
The store provided food and water for the hundreds of fire and rescue crews and media workers who descended on the crash site in the damp gloomy dawn.
Firefighters went through the wreckage five times with dogs and listening devices before determining that all the passengers had been accounted for.
Heavy equipment was then brought in to begin to clear the tracks, a process that will take several days, officials said.
Among the dead was Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy James Tutino, 47, a 23 year veteran of the department, who was commuting to downtown Los Angeles from his home in Simi Valley.
Two other sheriff's deputies aboard the train were injured.
"This is a complete outrage as far as traffic safety is concerned," Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said.
"When some individual parks his vehicle on the tracks that is cause for serious, serious alarm."
Mayor Bob Yousefian of Glendale called on federal transportation authorities to eliminate all grade crossings, which are responsible for scores of accidents and suicides each year around the country.
Federal investigators said they did not know the exact number of motorists who have committed suicides at rail crossings.
The police who investigate rail accidents are taught to look for signs of suicide, such as an absence of skid marks immediately before the crossing, indicating that the motorist saw the train and tried to stop.
Suicides more commonly involve pedestrians who walk in front of trains than those who park cars on the tracks, investigators say.
Wednesday's crash was the third fatal accident involving Metrolink in the past three years.
In January 2003, a Metrolink train smashed into a truck and derailed, killing the motorist and injuring 32 train passengers.
In April 2002, a freight train plowed into a stopped Metrolink train, leaving three passengers dead and 162 injured.
David Solow, the chief executive officer of Metrolink, described how the disaster unfolded.
Metrolink train 100, a four car train being pushed by a locomotive, was southbound from Moorpark to Los Angeles and approaching the Glendale station at 6:02 a.m. when its front car hit Alvarez's Jeep.
The front car, a so called cab car, has a compartment in the front for the engineer when the locomotive is in the back.
The rest of the two story car carries passengers.
Because Alvarez's truck was wedged between the rails and not sitting at a grade crossing, it became an "immovable object," Solow said, vaulting the front car of the train into the air and causing the cars behind it to twist on their couplings and fold in on each other like an accordion.
The out of control train struck an idle Union Pacific work train on a track just west of the Metrolink rails, knocking the locomotive on its side.
The train had numerous cars full of gravel and was preparing to go to Santa Barbara to repair tracks damaged in the recent California rainstorms.
After striking the Union Pacific train, the southbound train slammed into an oncoming Metrolink train, number 901, northbound from Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley.
Trains on the line can travel as fast as 79 mph, but the two trains involved in the crash were probably going slower because the southbound train was approaching the Glendale station and the northbound train had just left it, Solow said.
He said that the exact speeds, the various points of impact and the overall force of the collision would be determined by National Transportation Safety Board investigators.
Solow said that Metrolink and most other passenger trains were designed to withstand a collision with a light vehicle stopped at a grade crossing.
The cab car in the front of the southbound train has a reinforced frame that is designed to deflect or destroy vehicles parked at level grade crossings.
"Normally at a grade crossing the car is smashed to smithereens and the train stays on the track," Solow said.
"But this car was wedged between the tracks and the only way for the cab car to go was up."
He said that Metrolink is involved in three to five grade crossing accidents a year, some involving attempted or successful suicides.
"If someone wants to commit suicide," Solow said, "I don't care if it's on a highway, a railroad or jumping off a bridge, none of us is going to stop that.
It's one of the banes of our existence."
How well you sleep could depend on who your parents were, researchers at Switzerland's Lausanne University reported on Thursday after identifying for the first time a "normal sleep" gene among mice.
"The first lesson of our research is that the quality of sleep is genetically determined," Mehdi Tafti, a professor at the university's Centre for Integrative Genomics, told AFP.
The scientists used an electroencephalograph to study low frequency brain waves among mice.
These so called delta waves, the result of neuron activity, are telltales of the depth and quality of sleep.
"We realised that some mice slept less well because they lacked delta activity," Tafti said.
"When we compared their genes with those of other mice, we localised the gene responsible for this difference."
The finger points at a gene that encodes cell receptor for retinoic acid.
Vitamin A, found in eggs, carrots and other orange or yellow vegetables, is known to act on this receptor.
Scientists already knew that vitamin A plays an important role in the brain, in respect of sight but also diseases such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases that are also accompanied by a lack of delta activity.
Research on the mice found too much vitamin A was bad for sleep, although the scientists are unsure what the results of a deficiency of the vitamin would be and what the ideal intake is.
Too much vitamin A can damage health, especially among pregnant women.
In humans, delta activity diminishes with age, which is why children sleep deeply and awake refreshed, while old people usually sleep less well.
The study appears on Friday in the US weekly journal Science.
Previous research has identified genes that can cause sleeplessness, but this is the first to identify a gene linked with normal sleep.
Dr.
Frederic Quitkin, a psychiatrist whose research helped establish that certain kinds of depression could best be treated with medications and that schizophrenia was related to neurological impairments rather than problems of childhood, died on Oct 9 in New York.
He was 68.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his son, Dr Matt Quitkin of Washington.
Quitkin, a Manhattan resident, was the founding director of the Depression Evaluation Service at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and a professor of clinical psychiatry at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.
"He developed the concept of an atypical depression that is quite chronic, where people tend to overeat and oversleep and respond very specifically to a group of medications that aren't used that much," said Dr Donald Klein, director of research at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and a colleague at Columbia.
Many people with depression respond to selective serotonin re uptake inhibitors, like Prozac and Zoloft, or a class of drugs known as tricyclics.
Quitkin's research helped establish that atypical depression could be more effectively treated with a class of drugs known as MAO inhibitors, Klein said.
In addition to his work on atypical depression and schizophrenia, Quitkin researched other psychiatric disorders, including those associated with drug and alcohol dependence, and on treatment with a placebo.
Frederic Quitkin was born in New York City.
He received his undergraduate degree from Princeton and his medical degree and a doctorate of medical science from the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center.
In addition to his son, he is survived by two daughters, Megan and Rachel, both of New York, and two grandsons.
A teenage brain on pot looks frighteningly similar to the brains of adolescents with schizophrenia, according to a new study.
While it's too early to prove a connection, researchers at North Shore University Hospital Long Island Jewish Healthcare System caution that marijuana could be a match that ignites an underlying genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia.
Scientists have long debated whether drug abuse triggers schizophrenia, which in males usually appears in late adolescence, or whether the illness itself can lead to drug abuse.
"It is the story of nature vs. nurture," said Manzar Ashtari, an associate professor in radiology and psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and a scientist at LIJ's Zucker Hillside Hospital.
"If there are people who are vulnerable and smoke marijuana, they may be putting themselves at greater risk for developing severe mental illness."
Robert L. Balster, an endowed professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Virginia Commonwealth University, said that while more research is needed, "studies such as this are very important in providing new leads for possible brain mechanisms that could be involved in drug abuse and its frequent association with mental illness."
The studies at Zucker Hillside were done only in males because females tend to develop schizophrenia later, in their mid 20s and beyond.
Ashtari suspects the developing brain in late adolescence is at greater risk of environmental damage.
"Whatever insult is happening, it is taking place in brain regions still under construction," said Ashtari, who presented her findings Wednesday at the Radiological Society of North America's annual meeting in Chicago.
The scientists conducted several brain scan studies in teenage marijuana smokers who used the drug daily for at least one year, in adolescent schizophrenia patients who didn't smoke marijuana, in schizophrenia patients who also use marijuana regularly, and in healthy, nonsmoking controls.
Ashtari and her co investigator, child psychiatrist Dr Sanjiv Kumra, found that a brain region called the arcuate nucleus, a bundle of fibers that connects the front of the brain to deeper regions, is underdeveloped in both schizophrenia patients and in marijuana users.
While the lack of growth seems to be only on the left side in these teenagers, schizophrenia patients who also abuse marijuana showed problems on both sides of the brain.
Ashtari said the arcuate nucleus is critical to higher cognitive functions.
A study of a famine in China more than 40 years ago found that children born to severely malnourished women are more likely to develop schizophrenia.
The research bolsters the evidence that environmental factors can trigger the devastating mental illness.
Compared with children born before or after the 1959 61 famine, those born during the disaster faced double the risk of becoming schizophrenic later on.
The results are nearly identical to a previous study of a famine in Holland resulting from a Nazi food blockade toward the end of World War II.
"Since the two populations are ethnically and culturally distinct, the processes involved may apply in all populations undergoing famine," the authors said.
Lead author Dr David St. Clair of the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, conducted the study with researchers from China.
Their findings appear in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study supports the theory that schizophrenia is caused by a genetic predisposition influenced by environmental triggers that disturb the developing fetal brain in this case, nutritional deficiencies.
And that raises the possibility that preventing starvation and malnutrition could head off some cases, said Richard Neugebauer, a schizophrenia researcher at the New York State Psychiatric Institute who was not involved in the study.
Neugebauer said in an accompanying editorial that the study's similarity to the earlier Dutch findings is remarkable given the differences in the two populations.
Still, Neugebauer said, the new research leaves unanswered exactly how nutritional deficiencies disturb fetal brain development to the point of increasing the risk of schizophrenia.
It also does not resolve whether deficiencies in all foods or in a single nutrient increase the risk.
That is "the most pressing question from a public health and interventionist perspective," Neugebauer wrote.
The answer would determine whether the findings apply globally or just to developing countries where overall malnutrition is common, he said.
Schizophrenia is characterized by delusional thinking and difficulty in dealing with others.
It affects about 1 percent of the world population.
Symptoms usually appear during the teens or early adulthood.
Schizophrenia runs in families, and various infections including measles, flu and herpes are among environmental factors that some scientists believe may increase the risk when they affect pregnant women.
The famine study focused on the Wuhu region of Anhui province in eastern China, one of the hardest hit areas.
The researchers examined data on births and deaths before, during and after the famine and on psychiatric records from 1971 to 2001.
In 1960, in the midst of the famine, there were 13748 children born in the region, 192 of them developed schizophrenia.
That compared with 483 schizophrenics out of 59088 births in 1956 and 695 out of 83536 births in 1965.

Rats and mice and monkeys do not get schizophrenia.
That is lucky for the animals but bad for the millions of humans who suffer from it, often struggling with its delusions and mental damage from young adulthood until they die.
With no animals to experiment on, researchers have been hampered in their efforts to crack the question of what schizophrenia does in the brain to produce such devastating symptoms.
But they may be getting closer.
Dr Francine Benes of McLean Hospital has just published work showing that on the level of cells and chemicals, some of the changes of schizophrenia can be replicated in a rat's brain.
"This has never been done before, and conceptually, it's an important step forward," she said.
The rats did not behave as if they were seeing hallucinations or hearing voices though who can tell?
Rather, Benes used a drug to mimic some of the biological changes of schizophrenia, and recorded electrical activity in the brain showing that, indeed, schizophrenia like effects in certain circuits in the rat's brain had resulted.
Her findings could lead to new targets for schizophrenia drugs, and also could allow researchers to better pinpoint genes that are involved in the disease.
"This is a pioneering study that reproduces the neuropathology of schizophrenia in rodents," said Dr Alessandro Guidotti, a schizophrenia researcher and scientific director of the Psychiatric Insitute of the University of Illinois at Chicago.
It is only a partial model, he cautioned, so "this has to be taken with a grain of salt."
But it could provide a way to test schizophrenia drugs on animals for potential use in humans, he said, and the lack of such animal models up until now has been a major obstacle to the development of better drugs.
Research on the basic biology of disease often can only be done in animals, because test animals are killed, dissected, or subjected to other procedures that would be unethical in humans.
Published this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Benes's findings in rats build on two decades of research, by her and others, beginning with an analysis of brain tissue from dead schizophrenics and now including high tech brain imaging and genetic analysis.
It was back in the 1980s, Benes recalled, that researchers began to suspect that levels of a chemical messenger in the brain called GABA were abnormal in people with schizophrenia.
GABA is the main such messenger that inhibits, or dampens, the firing of neurons in the brain.
Benes gradually realized that there were two particular areas of the brain where the GABA abnormalities showed up repeatedly: one area, in the cortex or rind of the brain, played a role in attention and emotion at the conscious level.
The other was in the hippocampus, which is central to memory.
It could be, she reasoned, that both of these areas were part of a network that is mis wired in schizophrenia, and the source of these abnormalities was elsewhere.
And yes, it turned out that major highways of nerve connections linked both these spots with the amygdala, a small almond shaped structure deep in the brain that is important for emotion and learning.
"So then we thought we had the makings of a rat model," she said.
"We ought to be able to experimentally manipulate the amygdala and produce changes in one of these downstream sites that are similar to what we see in schizophrenia."
With a drug called picrotoxin, Benes dampened the GABA system in the amygdala.
Two hours later, when her team examined GABA releasing cells in the rat's hippocampus, they could see changes similar to those in schizophrenia.
They also used electrodes to measure the activity in neurons in the affected areas, and found GABA levels dramatically reduced.
Such work, she said, is allowing her team now to dissect out the individual neurons that are likely most important in schizophrenia and figure out which among thousands of genes may be most important in the disease.
"We're inside the brain, we're inside the circuit, now we're inside the cells, and I really believe this is the trail that we have to follow," she said.

EXPLORING MENTAL ILLNESS AND BATTLING HER OWN (Science Times) Barron H. Lerner teaches medicine and public health at Columbia University.
Lucy Freeman, who died at the end of 2004, thought that there was nothing wrong with being crazy.
As a reporter for The New York Times in the 1940s and '50s, she worked to remove the stigma of mental illness, even writing a revealing book that chronicled her own psychoanalysis.
Freeman's efforts recall a heady time in the history of psychiatry, when two competing groups, the followers of Sigmund Freud and those who favored physical manipulation of the brain, each believed it had found a "cure" for mental illness.
We know more today, but all the answers are not in.
Freeman was born in 1916, the daughter of Lawrence Greenbaum, a prominent New York lawyer, and his wife, Sylvia.
In 1940, after graduating from Bennington College, she became one of the few women on the reporting staff of The Times.
Seven years later, she married William Freeman, an editor.
But Freeman had a troubled personal life.
As she said in her 1951 book "Fight Against Fears," she was angry, unhappy and unable to sleep.
She also had a series of ailments, including sinus headaches.
That Freeman turned to a psychoanalyst was not surprising.
The teachings of Freud, who believed that emotional problems in adulthood resulted from unresolved childhood conflicts, were at the height of popularity then, and his solution was psychoanalysis spending years revisiting one's life history with a trained therapist.
Still, Freeman's family and friends were displeased with her decision to go into analysis, responding, she said, with "skepticism, jeers and outright disapproval."
One acquaintance told her, "You're crazy if you go to a psychiatrist."
This type of response stemmed from the prevailing beliefs of the era, which viewed mental illness scornfully and its victims as deviants.
Compounding this stereotype was the reliance on imposing state hospitals, like the one depicted in the 1948 Hollywood film "The Snake Pit," to house people with severe schizophrenia or depression.
In truth, many psychiatrists were trying to convert such institutions from overcrowded, custodial facilities to modern medical centers.
Believing that mental illness stemmed from organic problems within the brain, psychiatrists had devised a series of treatments, including electroshock therapy and lobotomy.
It was these advances that Freeman relentlessly publicized as The Times' reporter on mental health.
Writing scores of articles like "Action Now Urged on Mental Cases" and "State Mental Care Entering New Era," she willingly blurred the roles of reporter and advocate.
But Freeman's heart lay in promoting psychoanalysis, which she believed had greatly improved her own condition, most likely a severe form of neurosis.
By helping her confront her childhood conflicts, which included hating her mother, having sexual feelings for her father and envying her siblings, her analyst, she said, had cured her headaches and eased her psychological pain.
Psychoanalysis, she wrote, "is part of today's struggle for survival."
Freeman and her analyst saw unexplored childhood and adult fears as the cause of mental illness even of psychotic conditions like schizophrenia.
As she wrote, fear had "incited the anger, the hatred, the guilt" and thus "split me into pieces."
Not surprisingly, perhaps, this emphasis on fear had great currency during the Cold War, leading former mental patients to start "Fight Against Fear" clubs across the nation.
From our modern perspective, viewing fear as the cause of most mental illnesses seems quite outdated.
Even Freud had intended that only neurotics, as opposed to people with more severe diseases, explore their childhood conflicts.
Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that disorders like schizophrenia have a genetic basis and result from chemical abnormalities in the brain.
While lobotomy has been abandoned, electroshock therapy is still used to treat depression.
And over the last 50 years, scientists have developed numerous effective medications to treat psychosis and other symptoms of mental illness.
Meanwhile, the grand claims made by Freeman and others for psychoanalysis have been challenged.
Researchers argue that the effectiveness of psychoanalysis, like other medical interventions, needs further validation through studies.
Lucy Freeman wanted to hear none of this.
According to her niece, Dale Schroedel, her aunt remained "absolutely devoted and committed to Freud even when he became archaic."
Many therapists still agree with Freeman.
Analysis, and its less intensive cousin, psychotherapy, remain a cornerstone of psychiatric practice.
Freeman eventually wrote 78 books, many of them addressing the connection of emotions and health.
In so doing, she further fought the stigma that plagued her and others suffering from mental illness.
"By saving them," she wrote, "in some way I also saved myself."
Copy machines that talk.
Co workers conspiring to kill.
These are the kinds of bizarre hallucinations and delusions that have driven people with schizophrenia from schools and workplaces and deposited them on the lonely margins of society.
Now, however, doctors are discovering that other well known, but much less flamboyant, symptoms of the brain disorder may be just as significant in preventing schizophrenics from engaging in the real world.
Mental confusion, apathy and the inability to experience pleasure are now thought to be major barriers to a return to mainstream life.
Such symptoms are hard to treat.
Although a number of antipsychotic medications can help blot out the so called "positive" symptoms of schizophrenia the disorienting and disturbing hallucinations and delusions there are no medications to treat the cognitive impairment and emotional symptoms.
In recent years, researchers have started seeking therapies for these so called "negative" symptoms of schizophrenia, says Dr Stephen Marder, a professor of psychiatry at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at the University of California, Los Angeles and director of the mental health research, education and clinical center for the VA Greater Los Angeles Health Care System.
The impetus has been the recovery movement, an effort by patients, their families and other mental health advocates that aims not to "cure" the disease but to restore schizophrenics as functioning members of society.
"The recovery movement is saying, 'You can go just so far in improving positive symptoms, but we also want to be able to socialize, to work and make progress in our lives,' " says Marder, who has helped spearhead a national research effort addressing the problem.
"If that is going to happen, it's likely we're going to have to develop drugs that address those areas."
The cognitive and emotional problems can be deeply crippling.
People with schizophrenia "seem like they have a lack of ability to express themselves," Marder says.
"They are also oftentimes apathetic.
Some will say, 'I would really like to do things, but I can't get myself interested in doing it.'
" College students experiencing their first psychotic episode often find they can no longer continue school even if promptly treated with antipsychotics and the hallucinations are resolved, he says.
"They'll find their grades deteriorate.
Reading and studying and focusing their attention becomes so difficult."
The search for treatments for these problems represents a dramatic shift in drug development goals for schizophrenia.
As recently as a decade ago, doctors and patients rejoiced in a new family of antipsychotic medications aimed at reducing hallucinations and delusions without many of the severe side effects linked to the older antipsychotic drugs.
Older drugs, such as Haldol, typically cause tremors and muscle rigidity.
But the new so called atypical antipsychotics, though helpful to many, haven't led to sweeping improvements in quality of life, experts acknowledge.
In an 18 month study released in September, researchers found that three quarters of the patients stopped taking their assigned drugs before the trial's conclusion because the medications didn't improve their condition enough or because of side effects such as tremors or significant weight gain.
Even with treatment, about 85 percent of schizophrenics are unemployed, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.
"Ten years ago, there was a hope that the newer medications would give us a greater chance at recovery, the vanishing of the disorder," says Dr Thomas R. Insel, director of NIMH.
"I think (the study) makes clear that the medications we currently have are necessary but not sufficient."
Several drug companies are continuing to seek better antipsychotic drugs.
But the main focus of research within the government and academia is on better understanding the negative symptoms of the disease.
For decades, scientists have blamed schizophrenic symptoms on abnormalities in the brain chemical dopamine and these are, indeed, linked to the delusions and hallucinations.
But new research suggests other brain chemicals are involved in the disorder, contributing to such symptoms as confusion and emotional unresponsiveness.
NIMH is collaborating with universities and industry to identify possible new medications for cognitive deficits and develop better instruments for assessing improvements.
Ideally, these new medications would give people with schizophrenia the ability to concentrate, carry out tasks and interact socially.
One promising substance is a drug, D cycloserine, that is used to control tuberculosis.
D cycloserine works on a structure in the brain known in shorthand as the NMDA receptor, which plays a key role in learning and memory.
It's believed that some of the symptoms of schizophrenia are caused by a blockage or abnormality of this receptor, D cycloserine appears to unblock it.
Studies on D cycloserine drugs for schizophrenia are still in early stages.
But one study, reported in March in the journal Biological Psychiatry, showed that 39 people with schizophrenia taking D cycloserine in addition to a traditional antipsychotic experienced improvements in a range of symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, apathy, withdrawal and cognitive deficits.
Another avenue of study involves targeting a serotonin receptor that is critical to cognitive function.
Saegis Pharmaceuticals, a company in Half Moon Bay, Calif., is teaming with Eli Lilly & Co. in phase 2 testing of a drug, SGS518, which blocks this receptor, with the hope of improving cognitive functioning.
Meanwhile, San Diego's Acadia Pharmaceuticals is studying a chemical that may help subdue psychotic symptoms as well as improve cognition.
The company is on track to present results from phase 2 studies within a year, said chief executive officer Uli Hacksell.
"There is a lot of excitement about the ability to improve the negative symptoms in schizophrenia," Hacksell says.
"It's time to do something about this part of the symptomology of the disease that hasn't been dealt with so far."
Drugs, however, will take recovery only so far.
Non drug treatments are also important.
For example, Insel says, a program called supportive employment in which employees receive job coaching, support, even transportation can boost employment rates from 10 percent to 50 percent.
Educating family members, and engaging them as part of the treatment team, can also sharply reduce the relapse rate.
"This whole push for recovery is very important, but I don't think medications are going to be the largest part of that story," Insel says.
"I think we have some very good (nonmedical) treatments that are not used nearly enough.
We need multiple forms of care, not just medication."
A new gene has been identified to link with higher risk of schizophrenia and depression, scientists reported on Thursday.
Schizophrenia and related mood disorders are thought to arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but researchers have had difficulty identifying the specific genes involved.
Earlier studies have found a gene called DISC1, operating in a way that may contribute to the disorder, may make people susceptible to schizophrenia.
However, the function of its encoded protein has been unclear.
The new research, appearing in the Nov 18 issue of the journal Science, presented genetic and biochemical evidence suggesting that the DISC1 protein interacts with an enzyme called phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), which in turn influences the activity of the signaling molecule cAMP.
This signaling system has previously been implicated in learning, memory and mood in other experimental systems, which is consistent with the idea that alterations in the system may contribute to schizophrenia, according to the researchers.
Damage to the gene PDE4B is also seen to increase the risk of developing mental illness.
In addition, the researchers have discovered that DISC1 acts as a regulator for PDE4B, creating a 'pathway' between the two genes.
"The new genetic link we have made to PDE4B and how that links back to DISC1 sheds much needed light on these debilitating disorders.
It also suggests a new way of thinking about developing better and effective medicines," said David Porteous, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, Britain, who led the study.
The new discovery may in the future lead to the eventual development of new drugs to treat mental health problems, the researchers said.
"Our insights into the important role that the proteins PDE4B and DISC1 may play in the mis function of the brain that leads to schizophrenia will lead our thinking in the development of new treatments for this disorder," said Peter Hutson, co author of the study from the drug maker Merck Sharp & Dohme.
Researchers are offering new ammunition to worried parents trying to dissuade their teens from smoking marijuana: Evidence is mounting that for some adolescents whose genes put them at added risk, heavy pot use could increase the chances of developing severe mental illness psychosis or schizophrenia.
This week, the pot psychosis link gained ground when two major medical journals reviewed the research to date and concluded that it was persuasive.
In PLOS Medicine, an Australian public health policy expert wrote that genetically vulnerable teens who smoke marijuana more than once a week "appear at greater risk of psychosis," while the British medical journal BMJ cited estimates that marijuana use could contribute to about 10 percent of cases of psychosis.
The new research has little hint of "Reefer Madness" alarmism.
Rather, a half dozen long, careful studies published in the last several years have tried to determine whether pot smoking is a cause rather than an effect of mental illness.
And groundbreaking research has begun to try to pinpoint which genes and brain chemicals could do the damage.
The conclusions remain controversial, in part because it would be unethical to randomly assign teens to smoke or not smoke pot which would be necessary to perform a gold standard study to definitively show that adolescent marijuana use causes mental illness.
It could be the other way around, or some other factor could put teens at risk of both.
But the recent research has attempted to get around these hurdles by controlling for factors such as the presence of psychosis before the use of marijuana, family income, education, other drug use, and childhood traumas.
"No single study is perfect," Wayne Hall, author of the PLOS Medicine essay and a professor at the University of Queensland, said in an e mail interview.
"But the fact that so many individually imperfect studies so consistently find this relationship adds confidence to the conclusion that the relationship is causal."
The recent research points to adolescence as a particularly risky time to smoke marijuana heavily for those genetically predisposed to mental illness.
Brain scientists theorize that marijuana may induce temporary changes in brain chemistry that, when reinforced over time, become permanent.
Among the research cited by both papers appearing this week was an intriguing study published last year that followed a group of more than 800 New Zealanders from birth until age 26.
The study looked at people with a gene variant that apparently predisposes them to developing psychosis, and people without it.
The variant was carried by 25 percent of the study's participants.
The study found that among those with this variant, smoking marijuana as teens increased their risk of psychosis in young adulthood nearly tenfold compared with those who did not smoke as teens.
Those who smoked pot but did not have the gene variant incurred little or no added risk.
No test of such gene variants is widely available.
Dr Robin Murray, a psychiatry professor at Kings College London and an author of the New Zealand paper, said he and other researchers like to joke that they should set up a DNA test tent at rock concerts and tell customers whether it is safe to get stoned.
In reality, however, the gene research is at too early and tentative a stage to justify offering a test, he said.
Other studies cited in the BMJ article found that teens and young adults who smoked marijuana had roughly double the risk of later developing psychotic symptoms, but these studies did not distinguish between carriers and noncarriers of the gene variant.
Still, even among pot smokers, the absolute risk of developing schizophrenia was low, Murray said about 2 percent.
And the added risk from smoking pot was small compared to, say, cigarette smoking, which multiplies a person's chances of lung cancer by 15, he noted.
Overall, schizophrenia affects about one in every 100 people, and two more in every 100 experience a lesser form of psychosis.
This week's PLOS Medicine essay suggests that teens should be considered vulnerable if they have psychosis in the family, an indication their genes may predispose them to it, or have had "unusual psychological experiences after using cannabis."
In recent months, the White House has emphasized a causal link between marijuana and schizophrenia as part of an antipot campaign, but the National Institute on Drug Abuse does not list psychosis as a marijuana risk on its informational website.
The evidence for a link is becoming more convincing, said Dr Wilson Compton, who directs the institute's public health research program.
But he said the agency wants "to make sure we don't overblow" the risk, because that would make teenagers likelier to discount the warnings.
The controversy stems in part from the challenges of the research.
Consider a boy who has shown early signs of schizophrenia since childhood, lacking friends and seeking isolation.
In his early teens, he starts hanging out with pot smokers, gets increasingly withdrawn and is finally diagnosed with schizophrenia at 19.
In a case like that, it is likely that the early symptoms of the disease led to the pot smoking rather than vice versa, said Dr Harrison Pope, director of the Biological Psychiatry Laboratory at Harvard's McLean Hospital.
"I'm not saying the studies are wrong," he said.
"I'm saying this is a caveat you have to bear in mind even when you see six studies all in agreement it's very, very difficult in retrospect to tease apart the chain of causality."
But even marijuana advocates allow that there could be a link, at least for a small minority of pot smokers.
Marijuana has an excellent safety record when used in moderation by adults, emphasized Paul Armentano, senior policy analyst for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
But "I would not rule out that heavy use of marijuana at a young age, particularly combined with other drugs, could precede onset of some symptoms of mental illness."
The New Zealand study, published last year in the journal Biological Psychiatry, looked at a gene called COMT, which is involved in the breakdown of dopamine, a brain chemical known to play a role in psychosis.
Though the researchers found a dramatically higher risk when teenagers with the wrong variant of the gene regularly smoked marijuana, they cautioned that even so, that combination accounted for only one fifth of the people in the study who became psychotic.
Still, the COMT study has brought excitement among psychiatric researchers, because it highlights so elegantly how a single gene could interact with an environmental factor to contribute to mental illness.
Now the challenge is translating the research into a credible warning for teenagers.
"People who smoke pot don't automatically go on to become schizophrenic boom boom boom," said Alan Budney, a professor and federally funded addiction researcher at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.
"There's an intricate level of risk factors that don't apply to Tom, Dick, and Harry it just applies to, say, Jim."
At least, said Murray of London, he now has better answers for schizophrenic patients who ask, "Why is it you're telling me that cannabis contributed to my going psychotic when all my mates smoked more than me and nothing ever happened to them?"

INSULIN A SUSPECT IN ALZHEIMER'S, SCHIZOPHRENIA A graphic is being sent to NYTNS Photo Service subscribers.

A small but growing chorus of scientists is becoming convinced that insulin is just as important to the brain as it is to the body.
The body needs insulin to convert sugar in the bloodstream to energy.
People whose bodies either don't make enough insulin or don't process it correctly develop Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, which can lead to poor circulation, kidney failure, blindness, and death.
The role of insulin in the brain is less clear, but this much is certain: When brain cells are deprived of insulin, they die.
Now researchers are discovering that a breakdown in insulin processing in the brain plays a role in mental illnesses.
Perhaps even a driving role.
Dr Suzanne de la Monte, a neuropathologist at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, believes that Alzheimer's disease could be called "Type 3 diabetes."
And C. Anthony Altar, president of Maryland based Psychiatric Genomics, refers to schizophrenia as "diabetes of the brain."
Though researchers are still answering basic questions about insulin's role in mental illness, the potential impact of their work is dramatic.
Until now, research on the ravages of Alzheimer's has centered mainly on the amyloid plaques that build up in the brain as the disease progresses, while scientists have focused on a breakdown in brain cell communication to explain schizophrenia, in which victims often become delusional and erratic as brain tissue dies.
If the insulin researchers are right, those problems could be secondary to a more fundamental breakdown in the way brain cells process insulin to generate energy and protect themselves against death.
Whether an insulin shortage "causes the disease, contributes to the disease, or it's the brain's response to injury we don't know yet," said Dr Jesse Roth, geriatrician in chief of the North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System, who has studied insulin's role in the brain since the 1980s.
Doctors who treat Type 2 diabetes are already concerned about whether their patients are at greater risk of developing diseases of the brain later in life.
Studies have shown that diabetic patients are at greater risk of Alzheimer's, but researchers have assumed that diabetes is just one of several risk factors.
Likewise, people with schizophrenia are at least twice as likely to develop Type 2 diabetes, but until now, scientists have attributed that to the unhealthy lifestyle of schizophrenics as well as the medications they take.
"We need to do the basic science, because we need to be sure," said Dr C. Ronald Kahn, president of the Joslin Diabetes Center, who is concerned that the current Type 2 diabetes epidemic could foreshadow an explosion of mental illness.
Kahn's research also suggests that insulin problems in the brain, in turn, may make people more vulnerable to Type 2 diabetes.
Lab mice genetically modified to block insulin processing in the brain became obese and showed signs of diabetic insulin resistance.
"If this is correct, the public health implications are huge," he said.
Ironically, some doctors had latched onto insulin as a possible treatment for mental illness in the mid 20th century, when "insulin shock therapy" became popular as a last ditch treatment for schizophrenia.
The treatment pumped patients so full of the hormone that they would go into a diabetic coma.
While some schizophrenics, such as John F. Nash Jr., the mathemetician portrayed in the movie "A Beautiful Mind," showed improvement from the shock treatment, up to 10 percent of the patients died, and by the early 1960s, insulin therapy had gone onto the scrapheap of medical history.
When Roth began his research for the National Institute of Health 25 years ago, most neurologists agreed that insulin played a negligible role in brain chemistry.
Insulin levels in the brain were low compared with levels in the rest of the body, and the brain seemed to have limited need for the hormone.
But Roth's team at NIH demonstrated that brain cells possess insulin receptors to grab the hormone as it floated by and took pictures of insulin binding to receptors in rats' brains.
They argued that insulin plays a complex role in brain cells, from cell repair to self defense.
Far from being a bit player in the brain, Roth suggested that insulin "has a very rich job description."
When de la Monte started her insulin research in the early 1990s, the neuropathologist was amazed that few scientists had built on Roth's work.
She used a chemical treatment to drastically reduce insulin levels in the brains of rats and found that they developed Alzheimer's symptoms, including large scale cell death.
Immediately, she said, "I knew we had to stop everything we're doing and focus on Alzheimer's."
In recent years, De la Monte's lab has shown that the brain actually produces insulin itself rather than relying on insulin from the pancreas that circulates in the rest of the body.
Last year, in a study of brain samples from 45 Alzheimer's patients, de la Monte found that the number of insulin receptors in the frontal cortex, the center of intellect, drops by 80 percent in advanced cases of the disease, meaning that the cells don't get the insulin they need to survive.
"Insulin disappears early and dramatically in Alzheimer's disease," said de la Monte, who also teaches pathology at Brown University Medical School.
"Many of the unexplained features of Alzheimer's, such as cell death and tangles in the brain, appear to be linked to abnormalities in insulin signaling."
Of course, other Alzheimer's researchers say it's too soon to say that insulin defects are the most important cause of the disease.
Large scale studies have also shown that high blood pressure, obesity, and cardiovascular disease put people at higher risk of Alzheimer's.
"It is a real stretch to call Alzheimer's disease Type 3 diabetes," said Dr Hugh C. Hendrie, co director of the Center for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Neuropsychiatric Disorders at Indiana University.
He believes the disease probably has more than one cause.
The connection between insulin defects and schizophrenia is even less well established.
About three years ago, researchers at Psychiatric Genomics detected a strange pattern in the brains of deceased schizophrenia patients.
In the hippocampus, the brain region responsible for memory and learning, they found low levels of activity in genes that govern the breakdown of sugars and energy production, suggesting an insulin processing problem Last year the researchers discovered that the same 14 genes that are missing in the brains of schizophrenics are also missing in muscle tissue of diabetics.
What's more, they were able to boost production of the deficient genes in the lab by adding insulin or insulin like growth factor, a protein that is similar to insulin.
"We were quite stunned," said Altar of Psychiatric Genomics, which is now focusing on potential treatments for schizophrenia that would increase the activity levels of the genes.
"There's a whole series of steps that may prevent the schizophrenic brain from responding to insulin."
Of course, Altar's insulin theory remains new and largely untested, so even those who hope he is right, such as the Stanley Medical Research Institute, which is funding him, are cautious.
But Roth of the Jewish Medical Center said, "Whether he's right in detail I don't know, but he's right in principle."
So far, very few insulin based treatments for diseases of the brain have reached human trials.
However, physicians from the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System and the University of Washington are about to study whether insulin delivered in a nasal spray can improve the memory of people with early stage Alzheimer's disease.
But de la Monte is nvinced that one day, insulin therapies could help the nation's 4 million Alzheimer's patients, and maybe even Parkinson's disease patients, too.
"It opens the door to many other approaches to a disease that we don't really have any therapies for," she said.

Australian researchers announced a breakthrough Thursday in the search for the cause of schizophrenia, linking the impaired thought processes involved with the disorder to thinning grey matter in the brain.
Vaughan Carr of the Neuroscience Institute of Schizophrenia and Allied Disorders said the discovery could provide a better understanding of the genetic causes of the illness and eventually lead to improved treatments.
"The importance of this research is that it links together for the first time abnormal brain structure and function in the one image and ties that with abnormal thinking in schizophrenia," Carr said.
"Now this is a remarkable achievement."
The researchers used advanced computing technology to give them a "new window" into the brains of schizophrenia sufferers, Carr said.
They examined the thickness and function of the brain in 10 Australian patients with early onset schizophrenia while they performed a planning task involving attention and memory in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner.
They compared the results with a healthy control group and found those with schizophrenia had difficulty completing the task.
The computer analysis showed impaired thought processes and inability to problem solve among those with the debilitating mental illness were directly related to the thinning outer layer of grey matter and reduced activity of the affected part of the brain.
Carr said the find, to be published in the international journal Neuroimage, would open new areas of research examining post mortem tissue samples of the affected grey matter in schizophrenia sufferers.
"It means we can now focus on the genetics of a very specific area of the brain and delve deeper and deeper into why the tissue located there deteriorates in schizophrenia sufferers," he said.
Researchers hope to pinpoint genes that may be turned on or off in schizophrenia sufferers, leading to possible new treatments.
The mental disorder, which usually strikes people aged between 15 to 25, alters the way the brain functions and causes symptoms including hallucinations, hearing voices, delusions and impaired thinking.
The research was done in collaboration with scientists in the United States and Germany.
IBM said on Monday that it is teaming with a European institute in a research initiative to uncover the secrets of human cognitive intelligence.
Scientists from IBM and the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) of Switzerland will work together over the next two years to create a detailed model of the circuitry in the neocortex the largest and most complex part of the human brain, IBM said.
The scientists hope that by expanding the project, nicknamed the Blue Brain Project, to model other areas of the brain, they will eventually build an accurate, computer based model of the entire brain.
Using the digital model created with IBM's Blue Gene supercomputer, scientists will run computer based simulations of the brain at the molecular level, shedding light on internal processes such as thought, perception and memory, IBM said.
The scientists also hope to understand more about how and why certain microcircuits in the brain malfunction thought to be the cause of psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia and depression.
"Modeling the brain at the cellular level is a massive undertaking because of the hundreds of thousands of parameters that need to be taken into account," said Henry Markram, the EPFL professor heading up the project.
Under the initiative, IBM will install a Blue Gene supercomputer at EPFL, with a peak processing speed of at least 22.
8 trillion floating point operations per second (22.8 teraflops), making it one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world.
Markram is the founder of EPFL's Brain and Mind Institute, where more than 10 years of research and wet lab experiments have produced the world's most comprehensive set of empirical data on the micro architecture of the neocortex.
Researchers from IBM will use their experience in simulating complex biological systems to help turn this data into a working 3 dimensional model re creating the high speed electro chemical interactions of the brain's interior.
About 1.47 million Ugandans are suffering from sever mental illness, local media said on Friday quoting a report dubbed "Progress Report 2004 2005."
This figure also accounts for the two percent of the population that suffers from epilepsy, one percent suffer from schizophrenia and three percent maniac depression, according to the report.
Uganda has a population of 26.8 million, according to the 2002 national population census.
The report quotes World Health Organization statistics showing that mental illness accounts for about 12.3 percent of the global disease burden.
"This will rise to 15 percent by the year 2020 by which time, depression will disable more than AIDS heart disorders, traffic accidents and wars combined.
The impact, both social and economic, on the lives of mentally ill people, their families and communities is phenomenal," said the report which was carried out by an international non governmental organization, Basic needs UK in Uganda (BUU).
According to Dr Margaret Mungerera, a senior psychiatrist at Butabika National Psychiatrist Hospital, the number of people with mental disorders is likely to be high because the BUU study did not cover the whole country The study covered the districts of Kampala, Masaka, Hoima Sembabule and Masindi.
Uganda has a total of 56 districts.
"Basing on what we see, the country might even be having a bigger number of psychiatric victims.
Take example of poverty gibbering among the people, the northern Uganda war and the changed lifestyle, all these can cause mental disorders," said Dr Mungerera.
At least 115 mentally ill people in Kampala and Sembabule were cured of mental disorders and discharged during the study.
The BUU study was started in 2002 to determine whether Uganda would be eligible to initiate a mental health and development program.
Identical twins possess exactly the same set of genes.
Yet as they grow older, they may begin to display subtle differences.
They may start to look different, develop different diseases or slide into different personalities.
Women who are identical twins may differ in their fertility or in the age at which they reach menopause.
These discrepancies are usually attributed to ill defined differences in environment.
But a whole new level of explanation has been opened up by a genetic survey showing that identical twins, as they grow older, differ increasingly in what is known as their epigenome.
The term refers to natural chemical modifications that occur in a person's genome shortly after conception and that act on a gene like a gas pedal or a brake, marking it for higher or lower activity.
Identical twins have the same set of epigenetic marks on the genome when they are born.
But differences in the epigenome emerge as the twins grow older and become greater the longer they live apart, say a team of researchers led by Dr Manel Esteller of the Spanish National Cancer Center in Madrid.
Their report appears in Tuesday's issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
"This is one of the most fascinating things I have read," said Dr Nancy Segal, a psychologist who studies twins at California State University at Fullerton and the author of "Indivisible by Two," a forthcoming book on twins.
"By giving us a handle on something specific it opens up many new avenues of inquiry as to why twins are different."
There are two possible explanations for Esteller's findings.
One is simply the well known fact that epigenetic marks are lost as people get older.
Because the marks are removed randomly, they would be expected to occur differently in two members of a twin pair.
A second possible explanation is that personal experiences and elements in the environment including toxic agents like tobacco smoke feed back onto the genome by changing the pattern of epigenetic marks.
Esteller believes he is seeing both processes at work.
The evidence for the second process, he said, is that twins who reported that they had lived apart the longest also had the greatest differences in their epigenome.
"This is a way for the genome to be responsive to the environment," he said, noting that it is easier for chemical marks on the genome to change than for the genome itself to mutate.
His study suggests that the epigenome may be involved in many diseases that can affect identical twins differently, like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and cancer.
Although schizophrenia evidently has a genetic component, the epigenome may hold the clue to its nongenetic aspects.
Differences between identical twins could also help pinpoint the epigenetic differences that contribute to cancer.
"We think that epigenetic changes are very common in cancer," said Dr Peter A. Jones, president of the American Association for Cancer Research and a professor at the University of Southern California.
Jones said Esteller's finding "is exceptionally interesting in that it underlines the importance of epigenetic changes in human development and disease."
Jones recently convened a workshop to discuss starting an international human epigenome project.
The proposal could rival the Human Genome Project in complexity because the human genome is the same in every cell of a person's body, while the epigenome is expected to be different for each of the 250 or so human cell types.
Among the most important components of the epigenome are small chemical handles known as methyl groups, which are added directly to the chemical units of DNA.
A wave of demethylation occurs in a sperm's genome shortly after an egg is fertilized, followed by the extensive readdition of methyl groups in early embryonic development.
These methyl groups, which generally inhibit the activity of the genes in which they occur, tend to be lost during aging.
Esteller's team studied the total amount of methylation in the twins' genomes, as well as another kind of epigenetic modification, the addition of acetyl groups to the histone proteins that act as a scaffolding and as a control system for DNA.
At 76, Dr James Watson has been recognized repeatedly for his brilliance and his life altering discovery 50 years ago, along with a colleague, of the structure of DNA.
Remember that winding double staircase known as the double helix that's recognized worldwide as DNA's model?
That was his discovery.
And that finding at age 25 led him to become a Nobel Prize winner.
This day, when we meet, he is being honored by the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression at a Palm Beach dinner.
He sits with members of NARSAD the president has a daughter with schizophrenia and we begin talking about his research into devastating mental illness and his quest to find the genes that produce these disorders.
He has already found genes implicated in attention deficit disorder and Tourette's syndrome in children with autism.
And we begin to talk about diagnostic testing when these genes are isolated.
He thinks it's possible we could soon have a test, like that done for Down syndrome, for schizophrenia.
Parents could find out when the child is still in utero if it was afflicted.
(The same test, known as a DNA biopsy, might also be used in adults and children with schizophrenia to find genes that are damaged and then select the best therapy for them, similar to the way Herceptin is used in breast cancer and Gleevec is used for leukemia.)
"We just have to spend the money ,if you were at war, you'd work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but that's not the way science is done," he says.
"We don't have the money.
We have no grants in support of this."
He rambles on about famous families who have genetic defects bipolar, dyslexia, for example.
And how fortunate it would be if they donated money to his research.
"If you found the gene that caused it, you could finally rid this curse from the family," he says.
I ask him why he has chosen to concentrate now on schizophrenia.
"We have a son who's been hospitalized with it," he answers.
There is a shocked silence.
No one knew.
His son, now 35, hasn't responded to medication, he says.
I ask him about what seems the cosmic injustice: A man whose genius makes it possible for him to search out genetic causes for disorders to be a father to such a son.
"I just look at it as DNA can't be copied perfectly, and this has always been true, and it leads to a lot of inequality."
A speech given a few years ago enhances his views.
"Random throws of the genetic dice during the formation of sperm and egg take away from too many infants the opportunity to participate in a meaningful life.
Those unfortunate individuals genetically programmed ,represent unambiguous tragedies lacking in any compensatory side advantages.
Common sense tells me that no one is seriously harmed by steps taken to prevent the birth of such children," he has said.
So he, a Nobel Prize winner, hasn't been spared the pain of dealing with what his own research may someday spare others from suffering.
And that drives him, hard, every day.

Researchers in Iceland have discovered a region in the human genome that, among Europeans, appears to promote fertility, and maybe longevity as well.
Though the region, a stretch of DNA on the 17th chromosome, occurs in people of all countries, it is much more common in Europeans, as if its effect is set off by something in the European environment.
A further unusual property is that the genetic region has a much more ancient lineage than most human genes, and the researchers suggest, as one possible explanation, that it could have entered the human genome through interbreeding with one of the archaic human lineages that developed in parallel with that of modern humans.
The genetic region was discovered by scientists at DeCode Genetics, a biotechnology company in Reykjavik, Iceland, which has made the Icelandic population, with its comprehensive genealogy and medical records, a prime hunting ground for the genetic roots of common diseases.
Their finding is published in Monday's issue of Nature Genetics in a report by Kari Stefansson, Augustine Kong, Hreinn Stefansson and other DeCode scientists.
The report seems likely to receive considerable attention, even though it raises as many questions as it answers.
"I thought it was one of the most interesting papers in population genetics I have ever read," said Nick Patterson, a mathematician at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass., who advised DeCode on the article but has no other connection with the company.
The DNA region came to light during the search for a schizophrenia causing gene, which turned out not to be there.
But the DeCode researchers noticed that the DNA sequences they had examined did not seem to agree with those in the standard human genome sequence, said Kari Stefansson, DeCode's chief executive.
The lack of agreement turned out to be caused by the fact that the region exists in two forms in the Icelandic population.
The region is not a single gene but a vast section of DNA, some 900000 units in length, situated in the 17th of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes.
In some Icelanders, the DeCode team found, the section runs in the standard direction, but in others it is flipped.
Looking for any physical consequence, the DeCode researchers found that women carrying the inverted section tended to have slightly more children.
The section carries several known genes, not one of which has any obvious connection with fertility.
It is not clear why inverting the section should have any effect on the number of children, Stefansson said.
But the inversion does increase the rate of recombination, the shuffling of genes between generations that is a major source of genetic novelty.
That could account for some of the increase in fertility.
The DeCode scientists found that the chromosome 17 inversion is rare in Africans and almost absent in Asians, but is present in 20 percent of Europeans, the same frequency as in Iceland.
The inversion seems to have been favored by natural selection among Europeans in fairly recent times, perhaps the past 10000 years.
"Maybe something switched it on in the European environment, such as an interaction with diet," said David Reich, a population geneticist at the Broad Institute.
Fertility is without doubt affected by different genes in different populations, and DeCode found a genetic element special to Europeans because that is where it was looking.
The increased frequency of the inversion in Europeans is one of a growing number of examples of recent human evolution.
The inversion itself, however, is surprisingly ancient.
Its age is revealed by its counterpart, the standard or noninverted section of chromosome 17.
The standard and inverted regions cannot exchange genetic elements during recombination because their DNA sequences do not match.
Hence, unlike most of the rest of the genome, which gets shuffled in each generation, the two forms have existed separately since their creation.
This event presumably happened when the region came adrift from its parent chromosome and got knitted back in the opposite way.
When all the known versions of a human gene are compared, in most cases they turn out to have had a single common ancestor about a million years ago.
But the standard and flipped versions of the chromosome 17 region last shared a common ancestor 3 million years ago.
It is highly unusual for two versions of a gene to endure for so long, because one will usually get lost by a natural process of elimination.
The DeCode researchers propose two explanations.
One is that the standard and flipped versions confer different advantages, so that it is beneficial for a person to have inherited a copy of each from different parents.
This balancing selection can keep two versions of a gene around in a population indefinitely.
DeCode's alternative proposal is that the flipped version was carried for many years in a different human lineage, one of the archaic populations that preceded the emergence of anatomically modern humans in Africa 150000 years ago.
Then, in some episode of interbreeding, a single copy of the flipped version entered the modern human lineage some time before humans left Africa 60000 years ago.
In support of this view, the flipped version carries far fewer mutations than does the standard version, as if it had been accumulating them from a much more recent date.
There have been other recent hints of modern human interaction with archaic hominids, notably the finding in October that a lineage of body lice seems to have been inherited from a different human species.
Stefansson said that another property of the inversion, though one not described in Monday's article, was that it is associated with longevity.
DeCode scientists have located two sites on Icelanders' genomes where there is some genetic variant that promotes longer lifespan.
The chromosome 17 inversion, it turns out, lies at one of these sites.
It occurs at much higher frequency in women over 95 and in men over 90 than in the normal population.
"It seems to confer on people the ability to live to extreme old age," Stefansson said.
It is particularly surprising that the same genetic element should promote fertility and longevity, because most organisms are obliged to follow a strategy either of breeding fast during short lives or of living longer and having fewer children.
"Usually people think of there being a tradeoff between fertility and longevity.
So we are getting a free lunch here," said Dr Alan Rogers, a population geneticist at the University of Utah.
Stefansson said his findings were empirical observations for which functional explanations have yet to emerge.
Despite the loose ends, other researchers seem impressed with the solidity of DeCode's findings.
"It's a startling and amazing claim, and it's actually pretty convincing and compelling evidence at the same time," Reich said.
In Dr Huda Y. Zoghbi's laboratory at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, her research team has found the genetic roots of at least two crippling neurological diseases Rett syndrome and spinocerebellar ataxias.
Recently, she and her colleagues identified a gene that regulates the growth of tiny inner ear hair cells, essential elements of hearing and balance in mammals.
For her findings, Zoghbi, a 50 year old pediatrician who was born in Lebanon, has won major honors in the world of science, including her election to the National Academy of Sciences.
"To me, women don't have to give up relationships to dedicate themselves to science," Zoghbi said over coffee at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan on a recent Saturday.
She is married with two children.
"My life is two things: the people I love and my work.
With a little bit of organization, it can be done."
Q ) You started out as a neurological pediatrician.
Why quit the clinic for the research bench?
A ) I got into research for emotional reasons.
In 1985 when I was about to finish my neurology training, I was pregnant with my first child, Roula, who is now 20.
It was very hard on me to be an expectant mother and meet parents whose children had neurodegenerative diseases.
It devastated me to say, "Well, your child has a genetic disorder, and we can't do anything about it."
I was fortunate that around that time I ran into Professor Arthur Beaudet, a genetics researcher, who said, "I'll be happy to train you in molecular genetics."
So I started over because I wanted to find a way to solve some of these terrible diseases.
At the beginning, I knew less than the technicians in his laboratory.
Q ) How did you come to study the neurodegenerative disease known as Rett syndrome, which, I believe, strikes about 1 girl in 10000?
A ) While I was still a resident, I met Ashley, a 5 year old.
She couldn't communicate, was having seizures and balance problems and was constantly wringing her hands.
These are signs of Rett syndrome.
Her parents said she had started life as a perfectly normal girl and then at the age of 18 months, all of this became manifest.
Knowing that Ashley started out as a healthy child, it was hard to get her off my mind.
A week later, another little girl was brought to me with similar symptoms.
This can't be that rare, I thought.
So I went to medical records and found the charts of five more girls with symptoms that fit the diagnosis of Rett syndrome.
If I could identify about seven patients, I knew this was much more common than believed.
Moreover, I was intrigued by Rett syndrome, intellectually.
I wondered what goes on with the brain of a child who starts out normally and then loses her communication and motor skills.
Q ) Have you unraveled the puzzle of Rett syndrome yet?
A ) Well, we've found the gene that, when mutated, causes Rett syndrome.
That's the methyl CpG binding protein 2 gene.
Six years ago, we were able to clone it.
It turns out that this gene's mutations cause a lot more than Rett syndrome.
There are patients with it who get seizures and others who get autism.
In rare cases, you even have bipolar disease and mental retardation.
A couple of patients with juvenile onset schizophrenia also have this mutation.
So we think that the gene that's mutated in Rett syndrome is probably affecting many processes and neuronal activities.
It's the same for another neurological disease we study in my lab, spinocerebellar ataxia Type 1, which is also inherited.
That's even rarer because only 1 in 100000 people get it.
Yet, by studying it, we've learned that what happens to mutant proteins in the cell is the same as what happens to the proteins mutated in Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases.
In all cases, the mutant proteins accumulate within neurons and are not cleared properly.
So, if we can figure out how to deal with the proteins mutated in ataxia, similar approaches could be taken in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.
By researching diseases that affect only a few people, we might solve others that affect many.
Q ) Why is it such a big breakthrough when you discover a gene that's associated with a specific disease?
A ) With Rett syndrome, it's helpful to the parents of these kids.
Some thought they'd done something wrong and that's why their child was sick.
Once we had the gene, they could see it was not their fault.
In terms of research, finding the gene permitted us to make animal models of the disease.
We can now engineer mice to carry this mutation.
It is possible to finally study the disease in the mouse, and to spare humans.
Also, once you have the gene, drugs are a possibility.
Q ) The president of Harvard, Lawrence Summers, suggested that biological differences might explain why women had not advanced so much in the world of science.
What was your reaction?
A ) I was disappointed by how he phrased his comments.
When I read them, I worried about how a female graduate student would feel.
My biggest concern was that these words might be taken by young female scientists to go, "Oww, I might not make it."
And that really upset me.
In my own case, I've succeeded, in part, because I had a very supportive husband William Zoghbi, who is a professor of cardiology at Baylor.
We've been together since we were medical students in Beirut.
He's always respected my need to go late at night to do my experiments.
I also had fantastic mentors, male and female.
Dawna Armstrong, a Baylor pathologist, when my baby was 2 months old, she could see my guilt about being away from the baby and say, "Huda, babies, they sleep all the time when they are this age."
Q ) Do you think there's such a thing as a female style of doing science?
A ) I think females communicate quite a bit, and that's important in a lab.
Also, there are times when I follow my intuition.
You think, "I'm going to follow this, even though the data doesn't say I should."
I do wonder if that intuitive approach is more prevalent among women scientists.
Lawrence Summers didn't talk about any of that.
Q ) What drew you to medicine in the first place?
A ) I grew up in an educated, cultured Beirut family.
My mother urged me to become a pediatrician.
I started medical school at the American University of Beirut in 1975.
That was the year the civil war in Lebanon began.
Bombs fell on the neighborhood of the university.
My class was so determined to study that we attended lectures in the basement and we slept there at night because you couldn't go home.
I found a corner of the ladies' room where I lived for most of the semester.
At the end of that year, my parents sent me and my brothers to visit our sister, who was living in Texas.
They were afraid for us.
While we were in the United States, the borders to Lebanon closed.
There was no returning.
So Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tenn., a traditionally African American institution, accepted me two months after their term began.
But as kind as they were, there I was, 21, alone in a new country, always worried about people back home: 150000 people would die in the Lebanese civil war.
Somehow I managed.
That year shaped me.
Children of older fathers face an enhanced risk of developing schizophrenia when they grow older, according to research published on Friday.
Doctors in Sweden and Britain spotted the statistical risk after sifting through the medical records of 712000 people born in Sweden between 1973 and 1980.
They identified 639 people who had been hospitalised with schizophrenia at some point between 1989 and 2001.
Only four of these were siblings.
After taking into account the patients' socioeconomic background, family history of psychosis, early parental death and other factors that could affect the outcome, the researchers found a strong statistical link between schizophrenics and the age of their father.
More than 15 percent of cases may have been due to the fact that the patient had a father who was aged over 30 years at birth, they believe.
The risk of schizophrenia was statistically small but rose steadily the greater the age of the father at birth.
The authors say this statistical evidence adds to previous research that points to an inherited source for schizophrenia and that mutations in sperm, which accumulate as a man gets older, contribute to the risk.
Schizophrenia is a severe disease of the brain, characterised by hallucinations and delusions that give a distorted view of reality.
It is not, as is popularly thought, a Jekyll and Hyde condition of split personality.
The study is published by BMJ Online First, of the British Medical Journal (BMJ).
Its lead author is Finn Rasmussen, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.
The doctors say that their findings are important, given the trend in developed countries towards delaying parenthood.
In the case of England and Wales, they note that the average age of fathers at the birth of their child was 29.2 years in 1980.
In 2002, this had risen to 32.1 years.
If the model is correct, this increase in paternal age could have led to an additional 720 cases of schizophrenia in 2002.
Alarmed by the rising consumption of cannabis among French teenagers, the government on Wednesday launched a 10 million euro (13 million dollar) campaign to warn of the drug's harmful effects on physical and mental health.
With more than one in five 18 year old boys claiming to be regular users and more than half of all 17 year olds having smoked cannabis at least once France has the highest consumption rate in Europe along with Britain and the Czech Republic, according to official figures.
The media campaign including a series of radio and television advertisements and the distribution of hundreds of thousands of leaflets is to "set the myth of cannabis against the reality in order to debunk notions about its alleged harmlessness," the ministry said.
Nearly 250 consultation centres are also to be established across the country, and a telephone hotline set up to advise those tempted by the drug.
From the start of the next academic year, the campaign will be extended inside secondary schools.
According to the French Observatory on Drugs and Addiction (OFDT), there are 850000 regular consumers of cannabis in the country of whom 450000 smoke cannabis every day.
The number of 17 year olds who have experimented with it has doubled in ten years, the OFDT calcalates.
Toxicologists have established that the cannabis widely consumed today is far stronger than the drug that became current in university campuses in the 1960s and 70s, and warn that the psychological damage is greatly underestimated.
Among the harmful effects to be highlighted in the campaign are memory loss, concentration lapses, altered perception and alienation from friends and family.
"There is a syndrome of demotivation which results in a lack of interest in school work and a gradual desocialisation.
At the same time we now have proof of the link between cannabis abuse and certain acute or chronic psychotic conditions," said Dr Michel Reynaud, author of Cannabis and Health.
Recent studies have established that cannabis can be a contributory cause in triggering schizophrenia.
Concern over cannabis use has grown in recent years after a series of fatal road accidents in which it was shown that the drug was a cause.
In 2003 a law was passed that makes driving under the influence of cannabis a criminal offence, and urine tests are being extended.
"Cannabis has been shown to be responsible for 20 percent of accidents caused by people under 30 years of age," said Patrick Mura, president of the French Society for Analytical Toxicology.
The government is also alarmed by the power of the drug economy in the country's high immigration city suburbs, to where much the cannabis is initially smuggled from Morocco.
Medical marijuana is now legal in 11 states, and bills to legalize it are pending in at least seven more.
The drug is also at the heart of a case being considered by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Yet there remains much confusion over whether marijuana in fact has any significant medical effect.
"People subjectively report benefits," said Dr Joseph I. Sirven, an epilepsy specialist and associate professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Scottsdale, Ariz. "There's a whole Internet literature suggesting what a wonderful thing it is.
But the reality is, we don't know."
In an editorial last year in the journal Neurology, Sirven said the best studies of marijuana's effects on humans so far have shown little objective evidence of benefit in patients with epilepsy or multiple sclerosis.
And a growing body of research indicates that, at least in teenagers, heavy marijuana use over a period of years significantly increases the risk of developing psychosis and schizophrenia.
In the Supreme Court case, two California residents, Angel McClary Raich and Diane Monson, brought a suit against federal officials in October 2002 to defend their use of marijuana after six of Monson's marijuana plants were seized and destroyed by the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The federal government, which considers marijuana illegal under the Controlled Substances Act, asked the Supreme Court to overturn a Court of Appeals ruling that supported the two women.
Oral arguments were heard just after Thanksgiving and a ruling could come any day.
Raich's physician, Dr Frank Henry Lucido of Berkeley, Calif., asserted in an affidavit that Raich risked death if she was denied the marijuana to treat nausea, anorexia, severe chronic pain and other disorders brought on by a variety of illnesses, including post traumatic stress disorder, asthma and an inoperable brain tumor.
On a Web site created on her behalf, www.angeljustice.org, Raich says she joined the lawsuit "in order to save my life."
While little scientific evidence supports such a lifesaving role for marijuana, many studies have found modest benefits in patients' subjective measures of pain, sleep, nausea, appetite, tremors and muscle spasms.
"There's nothing better for nerve pain than marijuana," said Phillip Alden, 41, a writer in Redwood City, Calif.
Twice a month, he spends about $200 to buy a half ounce of high potency marijuana from one of San Francisco's medical marijuana buyers' clubs.
He smokes it three or more times a day to treat pain from a back injury and to improve his appetite and reduce nausea associated with AIDS and the antiviral drugs he takes for it.
It has even checked the progression of his peripheral neuropathy, he said.
Two recent surveys published in Neurology have documented widespread use of marijuana among Canadian patients and a widespread belief in its benefits.
The first survey, of 220 patients with multiple sclerosis, found that 36 percent had used marijuana to treat their symptoms and that 14 percent were using it at the time of the survey.
The second, of 136 patients attending the University of Alberta Epilepsy Clinic, found that 21 percent had used marijuana in the previous year.
Just over two thirds of the active users said it decreased the severity of their seizures and slightly more than half reported a decreased frequency of seizures.
But the lead author of the epilepsy study said it proved only that some patients believed in marijuana, not that it or its active ingredients, called cannabinoids, actually worked.
"There's not been a randomized, controlled trial demonstrating that marijuana or any cannabinoid is any more effective in controlled seizures than a placebo," said Dr Donald W. Gross, director of the University of Alberta's adult epilepsy program.
Although doctors may now prescribe marijuana in Canada for certain disorders, including epilepsy, Gross said he had never done so.
"It's terribly complicated from a physician's standpoint, and somewhat frustrating," he said.
"We have a product that has been legitimized without any evidence of efficacy."
A large body of research in test tubes and animals supports the view that cannabinoids have anticonvulsive properties.
But while a 2003 study of 657 patients with MS published in the journal Lancet found significant improvements in subjective reports of muscle spasms and pain, it found no improvement by objective measures after 15 weeks.
A follow up report on the same group of patients did show modest benefit after 12 months, but the researchers said the results should be interpreted cautiously because the study had been intended to test only short term benefits.
Dr David Baker, a professor at the Institute of Neurology in London, has found beneficial effects of cannabinoids in mice who have an artificially induced type of multiple sclerosis.
But, he said, "Showing clinical benefit in humans has been an elusive beast."
"At best there is a narrow therapeutic effect before the side effects become unacceptable for many people," he said. "
What is clear is that there have been no dramatic improvements overall."
Dr Kenneth P. Mackie, a professor of anesthesiology at the University of Washington, has devoted 15 years to studying the brain's response to cannabinoids through specialized brain receptors called CB1 and CB2. "There's a whole bunch of theoretical reasons suggesting there would be a benefit for marijuana on a variety of conditions relating to pain and neuroinflammation," Mackie said.
"But the clinical studies just aren't there."
Far stronger evidence exists for a harmful effect of marijuana in teenagers who use it early and often.
"We know that cannabis is a contributory cause of schizophrenia," said Dr Robin M. Murray, a professor at the Institute of Psychiatry in London and the co editor of a new book, "Marijuana and Madness: Psychiatry and Neurobiology."
In a 2002 study published in the British medical journal BMJ, Murray reported that New Zealand teenagers who started smoking marijuana before age 15 and continued doing so on a daily basis raised their risk of developing psychosis and schizophrenia from about 2 percent to as much as 10 percent.
The study, he said, ruled out the possibility that the teenagers who used marijuana were also those who were more likely to develop schizophrenia, whether or not they used the drug.
"You have to take a lot to go psychotic," Murray said.
"But with five joints a day for five years, an amount that is increasingly common in Europe, you're seriously increasing your risk of schizophrenia."
But he added, the risk dropped sharply as people aged, so that most chronically ill people who used marijuana for medical purposes were unlikely to experience psychosis as a result.
Research in the United States has been greatly hampered by legal restrictions.
In 1997, Dr Donald Abrams, an oncologist and assistant director of the Positive Health Program at the University of California at San Francisco, became the first doctor authorized by the National Institute of Drug Abuse to receive marijuana to conduct research to determine if it provided medical benefits.
Now more than a dozen California researchers are studying it under the auspices of the University of California's Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research.
"Cannabis has a 5000 year history of medical use," Abrams said.
He said he had completed three studies in patients with HIV that showed no negative effects on their immune systems or on the functioning of the protease inhibitor drugs they were taking.
He is now trying to show that marijuana has a beneficial effect on immune functioning, he said.
The Palestine Liberation Organisation's top body is to meet at 8:00 am (0600 GMT) to discuss arrangements for a smooth transition of power following Yasser Arafat's death, a top official said Thursday.
The PLO executive committee will discuss "the transition and how to fill the void left by president Arafat," as well as "preparations for the funeral and burial," negotiations minister Saeb Erakat told AFP.
"We extend our condolences to the Palestinian and Arab people upon the death of the symbolic leader," he added.
"Yasser Arafat is dead, but the Palestinian cause lives on and we will continue in the footsteps of Abu Ammar (Arafat) to freedom and independence and the creation of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital," he said.
The French government is understood to be ready to repatriate the body of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to Palestine if he dies.
While declining to give any information on Arafat's health, when pressed on the country's involvement in Arafat's funeral arrangements, a French government spokesman indicated France's readiness to repatriate the body.
"It is the medical authorities, in agreement with Arafat's family, to announce on Yasser Arafat's health," the spokesman told a news conference.
"For the rest, we are preparing all the necessary measures along with the family and the Palestinian Authority."
Palestinian representative in Paris, Leila Shahid, said Wednesday morning that Arafat was still alive but in a "very critical" condition.
Palestinian Islamic cleric Tayssir el Tamimi announced Monday outside the Percy military hospital that Arafat was still alive and that disconnecting his life support system is out of the question.
However, a Palestinian official source said Arafat's death will be officially announced on Wednesday at Arafat's headquarters at al Muqata'a in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
The Palestinian National Authority agreed at a meeting on Wednesday to hold Arafat's funeral in Cairo in case of his death.
A Palestinian senior cabinet official announced Wednesday that a series of meetings had been held since Tuesday night and to discuss repatriation of Arafat's body if he dies.
Minister of state in the cabinet Qadoura Fares said that "if Arafat dies, the body of the president would be brought to Cairo where Arab and international leaders and presidents could greet his body for the last time."
After Cairo, the body will be taken to al Muqata'a where all arrangements for the burial, mourning and condolences would take place, said Fares.
Egypt will host the eventual funeral of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, presidential sat an "agreement had been reached on holding a funeral ceremony for Arafat in Egypt in the event of Arafat's death."
This would enable Arab leaders to participate and to pay their last respects to Arafat "as a head of state" and national figure before the body was flown by helicopter to Ramallah for burial, the source added.
Abul Fattah's comments coincided with the convening of a crisis meeting of security chiefs at Cairo airport to discuss preparations to receive the Palestinian leader's body after an official announcement of his death.
They were also trying to put in place a contingency plan for the ceremony, expected to be attended by many leaders, and a host of other security measures to ensure that the event passes off without incident, a security source said.
French military hospital Percy confirmed on Thursday that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat died in intensive care at 3:30 a.m. (0230GMT).
General Christian Estripeau, spokesman for the health department of the French Defense Ministry, said in a statement that "Mr Yasser Arafat, president of the Palestinian Authority, died at Percy Military Training Hospital in Clamart on Nov 11 at 3:30 am (0230 GMT)".
Estripeau told reporters Arafat's body would be leaving the hospital and there would be no details at all on the cause of death or anything else.
Arafat, 75, had suffered from a variety of digestive tract ailments since he had been confined to his Ramallah headquarters by the Israeli army.
He was transferred to the French military hospital on Oct 29.
The fleet of trucks, bulldozers and backhoes lumbered into place here Wednesday afternoon, and aimed for a small grove of cypress trees, shoving aside the rusted remains of junked cars along the way.
By dusk, most of the debris was cleared away.
The cypress trees still stood, on the edge of a concrete parking lot, in the shadow of the ruined presidential compound of Yasser Arafat.
Sullen faced members of the presidential guard sat slumped on a wall and watched.
The workers were clearing space, in the sparse shade of the cypress trees, for Arafat's grave.
Believing Arafat's death in a French hospital to be imminent, officials spent Wednesday finalizing plans for his funeral and burial.
A memorial service will be held in Cairo, Egypt, they announced, followed by burial at the presidential compound, where Arafat lived in difficult conditions for most of the past three years.
The Palestinian foreign minister, Nabil Shaath, said Arafat had suffered liver and kidney failure, and that there continued to be bleeding from.
Arafat remained in a deep coma and connected to a respirator and a feeding tube.
French Prime Minister Jean Pierre Raffarin said that Arafat was in his "final hours," telling French television: "I hope that we can respect the final hours of a man who is approaching death."
A senior Muslim cleric, Taissir Dayut Tamimi, arrived in Paris on Wednesday to be with the Palestinian leader, who was at the Percy Military Training Hospital, connected to a respirator and a feeding tube.
"I prayed to God for his recovery," said Tamimi, who said he was with Arafat for more than an hour, reciting from the Muslim holy book.
Tamimi said life support machines would not be turned off "as long as there are signs of life in the body of the president."
But by midmorning Wednesday, Palestinian radio and television stations began playing recitations from the Quran.
Posters of Arafat started to appear on windows, doors and the hoods of cars.
Shopkeepers closed early anticipating an announcement.
Representatives from the three dominant political organizations the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Palestinian Authority and Arafat's Fatah party met jointly to approve a succession plan that divides powers among the three institutions.
It was agreed that the speaker of parliament, Rawhi Fattouh, would succeed Arafat as president of the Palestinian Authority until elections could be held, by law within 60 days.
Fattouh, 55, is from Rafah in the Gaza Strip and regarded as an Arafat loyalist.
But during a parliament session in August, the last Arafat attended, Fattouh pledged to carry out reforms if Arafat stood in the way.
The PLO, also headed by Arafat, plans to hold elections for a new chairman after Arafat's death, but officials said that the PLO's second in command, Mahmoud Abbas, would probably to chosen.
"The discussions were complex and difficult," said Qadura Faris, a senior member of Fatah.
"But everything will go well in the end and will go according to our laws."
Wednesday's somber remarks by Palestinian officials were in marked contrast to earlier this week, when officials considered discussing a funeral inappropriate.
Hamad Batrawi, 77, a long time clerk in the Palestinian Authority's Cultural Ministry, lives across a narrow street from the front gates of Arafat's compound.
A decade ago, Batrawi stood on his roof and watched Arafat arrive by helicopter, as Israel turned the city over to Palestinian self rule.
Last month, he watched another helicopter take Arafat away to France.
He said he would be back on his roof again when Arafat returns a final time.
Batrawi said, "It won't be the same without him."
The death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who has been lying in a coma in a French hospital for a week, was set to be announced at his West Bank headquarters Wednesday, a Palestinian official told AFP.
As a top Islamic cleric prepared for a bedside visit to Arafat, other sources meanwhile said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had offered to host an official funeral in Cairo in the event of Arafat's death.
"The death of President Arafat should be announced Wednesday after meetings of the central committee of Fatah and the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to be held at the Muqataa," said the official who asked to remain anonymous.
The announcement of the ailing 75 year old leader's death was expected after the return here early Wednesday of four top Palestinians from a visit to the military hospital at Clamart near Paris where Arafat was admitted 12 days ago.
However negotiations minister Saeb Erakat told AFP early Wednesday that Arafat was still fighting for his life as he confirmed that the veteran leader would be buried at the battered Muqataa compound in the event of his death.
"There is no doubt that if President Arafat dies he will be buried at the Muqataa," Erakat said.
However, he stressed that the head of the Palestinian Authority, who was dramatically flown from Ramallah for treatment in France on October 29, was still alive "at 2:00 am (midnight GMT)".
Erakat also pledged that Arafat's body would eventually be moved and reburied in east Jerusalem when peace with Israel is achieved.
"I think it (a burial in Ramallah) will be temporary and one day, when we have peace and we are alright as neighbours, President Arafat's body will be moved to east Jerusalem, to the al Aqsa mosque," he told Israeli radio.
Meanwhile, the Palestinian representative in France, Leila Shahid, said that Arafat was still alive but in a critical condition in hospital.
Foreign minister Nabil Shaath, a member of the four strong leadership delegation that went to Paris, said before leaving that Arafat was gravely ill but still alive.
After an anonymous claim by a fellow cabinet minister that Arafat had lost his fight for life, Shaath told journalists Arafat's condition had worsened and he was in a deep coma, but that his heart, brain and lungs were functioning.
Shaath gave a lengthy account of Arafat's condition to journalists, denying that life support machines would be unplugged.
"I want to rule out any question of euthanasia.
People talk as if his life can be plugged in or plugged out.
This is ridiculous.
We Muslims do not allow euthanasia," he said.
Shaath was accompanied on a 24 hour visit to Paris by three other top Palestinians prime minister Ahmed Qorei, the PLO's ac of religious courts in the Palestinian territories, flew in to Charles de Gaulle airport and was expected at the Percy military hospital in Clamart, Palestinian officials said.
An announcement of Arafat's death could have a galvanising impact on the stalled Middle East peace process.
US President George W. Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon have refused to meet with Arafat for the last four years.
However Abbas, who is now emerging as the key figure in the Palestinian leadership, was a guest of both men during his brief tenure as prime minister last year.
Speaking in Mexico City, US Secretary of State Colin Powell said his country was willing to work with whatever leaders the Palestinians choose in the event of Arafat's death.
"The US remains ready to engage with the Palestinian leadership as the Palestinians define that leadership," Powell said.
A Palestinian official source disclosed on Wednesday that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's death will be officially announced on Wednesday at the headquarters of al Muqata'a in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
Al Jazeera satellite news channel quoted the source as saying that the news of Arafat's death will be announced after meetings of the executive committee for Fatah movement and the executive committee for Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
Meanwhile, Palestinian well informed sources reported that both committees are holding several meetings in al Muqata'a, adding that a press release will be stated after their meetings.
The Palestinian Authority has declared a 40 day period of mourning across the Palestinian territories to mark the death of veteran leader Yasser Arafat, the head of his office said Thursday.
Private businesses are to close for three days and public institutions for seven days, but a general mourning will last for 40 days during which flags will remain at half mast and all festivals will be cancelled, Tayeb Abdelrahim said.
Arafat's death was announced by officials in Ramallah and at the French military hospital on the outskirts of Paris where he had been lying in a coma since the middle of last week.
Palestinian Cabinet's senior official announced On Wednesday that series of meetings were held since Tuesday night and discussed the way to bring the body of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat incase his death.
Minister of state in the cabinet Qadoura Fares said that "if Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat dies, the body of the president would be brought to Cairo where the Arab and international leaders and presidents could greet his body for the last time."
Fares said that after Cairo, Arafat's body will be brought to territories where all arrangements of burial, funeral, mourning and condolences would take place at al Muqata'a, the headquarters of Arafat in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
He added that meetings for PLO executive committee and central committee of the Fatah movement will be held after about an hour to look into the arrangements of Arafat's burial if it was announced that he died.
Tayeb Abdel Rahim, chief of presidency at Arafat's office had announced on Tuesday night that Palestinians decided to burry Arafat if Allah's (God) well and fate happens, in other words if Arafat dies "all the arrangements would take place at al Muqata'a."
"Al Muqata'a is a symbol of the Palestinian stead fasting and the siege has been imposed (by Israel) on President Arafat," said Abdel Rahim.
Israel sealed off West Bank and Gaza Strip, sent reinforcements to the two areas and tightened security at Jewish settlements Thursday just hours after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's death.
"The Israeli Defense Forces are deploying to allow a dignified funeral ceremony for Chairman Arafat," said Israeli military radio.
According to the blanket close off plan, only Palestinians with necessary permits will be allowed to attend Arafat's burial scheduled for Saturday in Ramallah, a West Bank city Arafat's headquarters was located, said Israeli military officials.
Such restriction meant no Palestinians will be able to enter Israel unless they have special permits from Israel.
The 75 year old Arafat died at a French military hospital at 3: 30 am local time (0230GMT) on Thursday.
The body of Arafat will be flown to Cairo, capital of Egypt, for a funeral scheduled for Friday.
After the memorial service, Arafat's body would be flown to Ramallah.
Senior Palestinian official Yasser Abed Rabbo denied on Tuesday reports saying that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has died in a French hospital.
Abed Rabbo told reporters in the West Bank city of Ramallah that the reports saying that Arafat who suffers from a deep coma earlier Tuesday had died "are totally untrue," adding that "Arafat is still alive."
However, a high ranking Palestinian security official in Gaza, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that he expects that Arafat's death would be announced within the coming few hours.
Herewith a summary of events related to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's health situation.
Oct 23: A team of Tunisian doctors are allowed by Israel to travel to the West Bank town of Ramallah to examine Arafat.
The Palestinian leader's advisor Nabil Abu Rudeina says Arafat is "OK".
Oct 24: Tunisian doctors say Arafat is suffering from a severe case of the flu.
Oct 25: Israel allows Arafat to leave his Ramallah headquarters, where he has been under siege for nearly three years, to be treated at a local hospital.
Oct 27: Arafat has fainted, Israeli radio says, although one of the Palestinian leader's aides denies that.
Palestinian prime minister Ahmed Qorei says Arafat is in critical condition.
Israel says it will allow Arafat to seek treatement wherever he wishes.
Oct 28: Qorei and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon speak by telephone.
At mid day a team of Jordanian doctors, including Arafat's personal physician Ashraf al Kurdi, arrive in Ramallah.
Israel says it will not restrict Arafat's movements.
One of Arafat's doctors says he is suffering from a blood disease related to a viral infection, cancer or blood poisoning and must be hospitalized overseas.
Palestinian television airs images of Arafat in pyjamas and surrounded by his doctors.
French presidency announces in late afternoon that it has accepted a request by the Palestinian Authority for Arafat to be transferred to Paris for treatment.
Oct 29: Arafat heads to the Jordanian capital Amman on board a helicopter and is then transferred to a French military jet that transports him to a military hospital on the outskirts of Paris.
Oct 30: Palestinian officials deny reports that Arafat is suffering from leukemia or that he has lost his faculties.
Oct 31: Sharon says he is opposed to Arafat, once dead, being buried in Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque compound.
Nov 2: Doctors issue a medical bulletin saying Arafat's illness is not leukemia but fail to disclose the exact nature of his illness.
Nov 3: Arafat is transferred to the hospital's intensive care unit.
Nov 4: A French medical source says Arafat is "brain dead" and breathing thanks only to artificial life support systems.
Officials categorically deny reports that he is dead.
Nov 5: His spokeswoman in Paris says Arafat is 'between life and death' and in a reversible coma.
Nov 7: French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier say Arafat is alive but in serious condition.
Barnier also announces that several Palestinian leaders, including acting Palestine Liberation Organisation leader Mahmud Abbas are expected in Paris the following day.
Nov 8: Arafat's wife Suha lashes out at the Palestinian leaders due to visit her husband, accusing them of trying to usurp power from him while he is still alive.
The Palestinian leaders cancel their trip to Paris but then reschedule it and arrive in the French capital late in the day.
Nov 9: Arafat's spokeswoman Leila Shahid says the four leaders Abbas, prime minister Ahmed Qorei, foreign minister Nabil Shaath and parliament speaker Rawhi Fattuh Qorei will see the ailing Arafat.
Arafat's condition deteriorated overnight and he is now in a deeper coma, the spokesman for the French army medical service says.
Egypt might host a funeral service for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the event of his death, Palestinian delegate to the Arab League (AL) Ahmed Sobeih told Xinhua late Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Al Arabiya TV channel reported Tuesday night that the Palestinian side will announce the death of 75 year old veteran leader Yasser Arafat Wednesday morning.
"Palestinian officials will make an announcement about the passing away of President Arafat Wednesday morning," the TV report said, quoting sources in France, where Arafat had been treated since Oct 29.
Earlier in the day, the Arabic language news network said that Arafat had died at a French military hospital.
As Arafat had struggled for life, there has been wild guess as to where he might be buried and where to hold the funeral service.
Egypt is reportedly to have offered to hold a funeral service for Arafat, partly to spare Arab leaders from Israeli security measures they have to go through if they go to the Palestinian territories to pay their last respect to the Palestinian leader.
Top Palestinian officials abruptly postponed a trip to Paris on Monday to ascertain the real condition of ailing leader Yasser Arafat after critical comments by his wife, a spokesman said Monday.
Arafat's deputy in the Palestine Liberation Organization, Mahmoud Abbas, and Palestinian prime minister, Ahmed Qurei, were asked by the Fatah central committee on Sunday to speak directly to Arafat's doctors, Nabil Shaath, a Palestinian minister, said Sunday evening.
But Arafat's wife, Suha, who has fiercely protected her husband's privacy, lashed out in an emotional television interview with Al Jazeera television early Monday, calling the planned visit by Palestinian officials a "conspiracy" against her husband.
"They are trying to bury Abu Ammar alive," she said, using Arafat's nom de guerre.
Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a senior Arafat aide, announcing the postponement of the Paris visit, also said that the critical comments by Suha Arafat "don't represent our people."
On Sunday, Shaath, who was to go with the two men, said: "We've heard many conflicting reports, and it makes us worried.
We want to hear from the doctors directly."
The extraordinary turn of events is an indication of the confusing court politics surrounding Arafat, who is variously described as on his death bed or recovering.
His wife is controlling the meager release of information about his health, even to Arafat intimates in Paris.
That the leading Palestinian politicians felt the need to find out the real facts for themselves is itself extraordinary.
Sunday night, the French foreign minister, Michel Barnier, told LCI television that Arafat was alive but that his circumstances were complicated.
"I would say he is in a state that is very complicated, very serious and stable at the time we are speaking," Barnier said.
Asked if Arafat were dead, Barnier answered, "I wouldn't say that."
Israel is preparing for a possible escalation of violence in the West Bank and Gaza after the death of Arafat, the Israeli defense minister, Shaul Mofaz, told the Cabinet on Sunday, Israeli officials said.
While Abbas and Qureia seem to be controlling the situation among Palestinians and are trying to reach internal agreement on a post Arafat leadership, Mofaz said, "there is no guarantee they will be successful" in their efforts to get Palestinian militants to stop attacks against Israelis during the current crisis.
Arafat's condition was described as unchanged by a spokesman of the French military hospital in Paris where Arafat is variously said to be in an irreversible coma, a reversible one or no coma at all.
The 13 main Palestinian factions held an emergency meeting Tuesday to discuss arrangements to follow an official announcement that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has died, an Islamic Jihad leader said.
"We are in the process of discussing the steps to be taken when the death of president Arafat is officially announced," said Khaled al Batch.
"The meeting brings together the 13 members of the high committee for national and Islamic forces, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and (Arafat's) Fatah party," he added.
On Saturday, prime minister Ahmed Qorei urged Palestinians not to allow themselves to be dragged into internecine warfare in the event of Arafat's death following a meeting with the factions and security services in Gaza City.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would be buried at his headquarters in the West Bank town of Ramallah, well informed Palestinian sources said Tuesday.
The sources told the Dubai based al Arabiya TV that France reached a compromise with Israel to bury Arafat in Ramallah after his death.
Palestinian officials refused to comment on the report, saying it was still too early to talk about the burial place as long as Arafat was still alive.
Tuesday witnessed a flurry of conflicting reports on Arafat's fate, with some claiming he was dead and others saying his vital organs were still functioning.
Israel opposes burying Arafat in Jerusalem, although Arafat himself indicated preference for the city for his final resting place.
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said earlier that Arafat could be buried in Gaza and Israel has completed preparations for the burial.
An agreement on funeral arrangements to be made in the aftermath of Yasser Arafat's death was reached Tuesday by Israeli and Palestinian officials, a senior Palestinian official said on condition of anonymity.
"Senior Palestinian and Israeli officials have reached an agreement in principle on the arrangements to be made after the death of president Arafat," the official told AFP.
He refused to give further details about the agreement, and in particular whether Israel had given the go ahead for the Palestinian leader to eventually be buried in his battered Muqataa compound in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was not dead at 3:30 pm (1430 GMT), a French official said.
An official at the army medical service said that Arafat "is not dead."
"The statement made public by General Christian Estripeau is still valid at 3:30 pm," he said.
Estripeau, the medical service's official spokesman, said earlier Tuesday that Arafat had slipped into a "deeper coma."
Two senior Palestinian officals Nasser el Qidwa and Leila Shahid also denied that Arafat was dead.
However in Ramallah a member of the Palestinian cabinet said that Arafat was dead, and that there was disagreement over when to make the announcement.
Israeli and Palestinian officials will begin talks overnight to discuss funeral arrangements for Yasser Arafat, a senior Israeli official told AFP Tuesday.
"The first contacts should take place in the night with the aim of reaching an agreement on the organisation of the funeral for Yasser Arafat," the official said on condition of anonymity.
No official announcement on the death of the Palestinian leader would be made until "an agreement is reached on his burial," the source added.
Palestinian foreign minister Nabil Shaath denied a claim by a fellow cabinet minister Tuesday that Arafat has died in a French military hospital but said he was very ill.
Yasser Arafat is in a "very difficult and serious" situation, the Palestinian foreign minister said Tuesday after he and other officials met their critically ill leader's doctors.
Asked after a visit to the hospital treating Arafat about reports that he was close to death, Nabil Shaath said: "Only God knows the answer to that."
"His situation is very difficult and critical," he told reporters.
He did not say what the diagnosis was, or whether the delegation had actually seen Arafat face to face.
Egyptian and Israeli rescue workers picked through the ruins of a luxury Sinai hotel Friday after at least 27 people were killed in bomb attacks on Thursday night that shook the hotel and two others popular with vacationing Israelis.
Israeli officials said they believed the blasts, in which more than 100 were wounded, were caused by terrorist bombs.
The workers from the two countries labored side by side at the ruins of the the hotel, the Taba Hilton, using heavy earthmoving equipment, their bare hands, and rope to pull apart the rubble, and enlisting sniffer dogs in a retrieval effort or to search for any remaining victims.
The two other blasts took place to the southwest, in the resort villages of Ras al Sultan and Nuweiba.
A coordinator of the Israeli rescue efforts, Col Gidon Baron, said that the bodies of some of the 27 people he confirmed were killed had been retrieved from the rubble of the hotel Friday.
An Egyptian doctor at the Taba hospital, Wael Nahran, said 22 bodies had been taken to the hospital's morgue.
A previously unknown pro al Qaida Islamist group called Islamic Tawhid Brigades claimed responsibility for the blast on a Web site, a Reuters report said.
The claim, along with one from another unknown group calling itself the World Islamist Group, could not be verified.
Agence France Presse reported that someone claiming to be from World Islamist Group had taken responsibility for the Hilton blast in a telephone call to its bureau in Jerusalem.
The caller said the attack was "in revenge for the Palestinian and Arab martyrs dying in Palestine and Iraq," the agency reported.
Israel's deputy defense minister, Zeev Boim, told reporters the attack appeared to be the work of "international terror groups like al Qaida or branches of it," according to Reuters.
The largest explosion was at the Taba Hilton, where early reports suggested that a truck bomb was driven into the hotel, located in a village just across the border and near the Israeli town of Eilat.
Israel Radio said Friday morning that officials thought there was also a suicide bomber in the Hilton.
The hotel was badly damaged by the blast and an ensuing fire, and 10 floors in the complex collapsed.
Part of the Hilton apparently crumbled immediately after the blast.
"I heard a huge explosion," said Yigal Vakni, an Israeli at the Hilton who spoke to Israeli Army Radio.
"The wall near me collapsed and people began to run."
The blast was outside, he said.
"When we went out we saw the shops and the internal wall of the hotel had collapsed."
Many people were lying on the ground, he said, "There is a lot of blood, a lot of screaming."
An unnamed Israeli woman told Israeli television: "We immediately ran toward the beach, everyone running at once, and windows continue to shatter as we ran away.
Entire families were wounded, they ran to the beach and were covered with blood."
An Israeli tourist, Gal Keshet, who said he took part in the rescue at Ras al Sultan, said that one vehicle exploded after it breached the resort, while another car did not manage to get in but blew up anyway, without causing casualties.
Last month, Israeli intelligence warned Israelis to keep out of the Sinai desert, citing vague but solid information about possible attacks.
Panicked Israelis rushed the border post, trying to flee Egypt, yelling at the border guards in Arabic that their belongings and documents were still in the burning hotel.
Guards fired shots into the air to try to disperse them, before finally shutting the terminal temporarily.
Roads were blocked, leaving vacationing Israelis at other hotels trapped.
Hadas Manor, an Israeli journalist staying at another Taba hotel, told Israeli television: "Most of the people here haven't come with their cars, so they depend on Egyptian taxis that are not operating now."
Television broadcasts of the border showed an Arab Israeli woman being carried by her husband.
As he put her down, she collapsed, and medics rushed to her.
Israeli television also showed scenes of ambulances arriving at Eilat hospitals and unloading the wounded, many of them bandaged and bloody.
Others, apparently in shock, were wheeled in on stretchers.
Israeli television interviewed a man, identified as Yaniv, who described the blast near Ras al Sultan.
"We were sitting in a restaurant and suddenly heard a very powerful blast," the man said.
"The electricity went out and rocks were jolted by the blast," he added.
"We then saw a second explosion not far from the first blast, it was a ball of fire higher on the mountain.
We immediately drove over to the site and found wounded people on the ground, there were Israelis among them, they were bleeding in the sand and there was no one there to help them."
The warning about possible attacks came in an unusual public alert from Avi Dichter, head of the Shin Bet intelligence service, not to go to Sinai resorts during the harvest festival season of Sukkot, which began last week.
He said there was intelligence about a possible attack against Israeli tourists in Egypt's Sinai, where as many as 12000 Israelis were traveling for the holidays, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry.
Since his warning, Israel has moved in force into the Gaza Strip that borders Egypt, trying to stop militant Palestinians like Hamas and Islamic Jihad from firing rockets into Israel.
But Israeli officials suggested that an attack of this magnitude would have been planned carefully from within Egypt and was not tied to the Gaza operation.
Hamas, which has improving relations with Cairo, may not want to embarrass Egypt in this way, said Oded Granot, an Israeli commentator on Arab affairs.
He suggested that al Qaida, an offshoot of the group or an Egyptian radical group might be responsible.
In November 2002, attackers drove a car bomb into a hotel popular with Israelis in Mombasa, Kenya, killing 13, and fired missiles at an Israeli charter jet, but missed the target.
Israeli officials speculated Thursday night that militants, finding it increasingly hard to attack Israelis in Israel, are choosing to attack them abroad.
They may also be trying to cause strains between Israel and Egypt, which are trying to cooperate on the Israeli government plan for a withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.
Israel also regularly complains that Egypt should do more to stop the smuggling of arms into Gaza and that Cairo does not take its security responsibilities seriously enough.
The Egyptians say that Israel would best protect itself by making serious progress toward peace with the Palestinians, rather than by accelerating the cycle of violence.
But Egypt will not want the Israeli Palestinian struggle to spill across the border and is expected by Israeli officials to move quickly to try to track down those responsible.
The attacks may also be intended to damage Egypt's tourism industry, on which it depends heavily.
In 1997, after militants attacked tourists in Luxor and killed nearly 70 people, Egypt cracked down hard on Islamic Jihad.
The Egyptian government at first suggested the Hilton explosion was caused by gas canisters and initially prevented Israeli rescue workers without passports from crossing the border to the hotel.
The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, spoke with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, and persuaded him to allow Israeli rescue workers to the scene without delay.
Yuval Steinitz, chairman of Parliament's foreign and defense committee, said: "What is sad is the fact that over recent months we have received incessant warnings concerning a possible attack in Sinai, and these warnings grew more and more clear, but the public failed to listen."
Taba is a small village dominated by the Hilton, originally built by the Israelis.
Israel returned the Sinai to Egypt in 1982 but claimed that Taba was inside Israel according to the international border.
International arbitrators disagreed, and Israel returned Taba, along with the expensive hotel, to Egypt in March 1989.
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have met numerous times at the hotel for peace talks.
Witnesses told similar stories of the attacks.
Hassan Elkhin told Israeli Channel 10: "After the blast, parts of the wall and ceiling began to crumble.
I ran to look for my friends and found them downstairs in the casino.
I pulled them out and we managed to leave the hotel.
The walls around us collapsed, and there was fire around."
Standing outside the hotel, he said, "we watched as the rooms disappeared, they collapsed one after the other."
When asked if he wasn't afraid to travel to Sinai, Elkhin said: "I heard the alerts and warnings, but I never believed anything could ever happen there, because, after all, every one there is Israeli.
"Still," he said, "it happened."
A group calling itself "Islamic Unity Brigades" claimed responsibility Friday for a series of bombings in Egypt's Sinai peninsula targeting Israeli tourists, and which Israel has blamed on Al Qaeda.
"Four of your martyrdom seeking brothers (suicide bombers) carried out this heroic operation,against a den of prostitution and corruption," said a statement posted on an Islamist website whose authenticity could not be confirmed.
The previously unknown group said the attack, which killed at least 19 people and left another 38 missing, was in revenge for Israel's assassination last March of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, and was "the first direct shot in the face of Jews."
Car bombs ripped through a major hotel and two beach resorts packed with Israeli tourists on the Red Sea coast of Egypt's Sinai desert, killing at least 19 people and causing scenes of mayhem in attacks that Israel blamed on Al Qaeda.
The biggest of the string of explosions late Thursday left a trail of carnage and destruction at the 10 storey Hilton hotel in Taba, a town just across the Israeli border that once hosted Israeli Palestinian peace talks.
"According to our first information, it appears to be an international terror attack with the hallmarks of Al Qaeda," Israel's deputy defence minister Zeev Boim said.
The explosions occurred as Israelis were celebrating the end of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, and followed intelligence warnings that Israelis should keep out of the Sinai because of possible attacks.
Estimates of the number of dead varied through the night as rescuers combed the rubbaeli public television.
Israeli police said the explosion was caused by a powerful car bomb detonated near the entrance to the four star Hilton, destroying a wing of the building.
Footage showed collapse staircases and tangled piles of metal and concrete South Sinai governor General Mustafa Afifi said two charred trucks were found at the tourist camps of Shitani and Ras Soltan on the coast road south of Taba, indicating that the blasts were also caused by car bombs.
Egypt threw up a security cordon around the blast sites in the Sinai renowned for its dramatic desert mountains and palm fringed beaches and boosted airport security in Cairo.
A previously unknown group calling itself "Islamic Unity Brigades" claimed responsibility for the attacks saying they were in revenge for Israel's assassination of Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin last March.
"Four of your martyrdom seeking brothers (suicide bombers) carried out this heroic operation,against a den of prostitution and corruption," said a statement posted on an Islamist website whose authenticity could not be confirmed.
Another group calling itself Jamaa Al Islamiya Al Alamiya (World Islamist Group) also claimed the Taba attack in a telephone call to AFP in Jerusalem to avenge "the Palestinian and Arab martyrs dying in Palestine and Iraq."
The explosions came amid a massive Israeli army offensive in the north of the Gaza Strip, a wedge of land near the border with Egypt, that has left 93 Palestinians dead in less than 10 days.
Resorts dotted along the Sinai's desert coast have remained popular holiday spots for Israelis since the territory was handed back to Egypt as part of a 1979 peace deal, the first between Israel and an Arab country.
But Taba, which in ancient times was once a resting point for caravans, was only returned in 1989 after years of wrangling following a ruling by the International Court of Justice.
Ties between the two neighbours an militant group Hamas to strike Israeli tourists in the Sinai.
At least 19 people were killed in a bomb attack on a hotel in the Egyptian resort of Taba and in two resorts further south on the Red Sea coast of the Sinai peninsula, an Israeli general said Friday.
At least 12 people were killed and 135 others injured in three blasts that targeted tourist resorts in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, the Interior Ministry said in a statement early Friday.
Most of the victims were Israelis.
The explosions came one month after the Israeli government urged citizens not to visit Egypt, citing a terror threat to tourists in the area.
The warning, issued on Sept 9 by the counter terrorism center of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office, identified Sinai as the target of a potential attack.
A huge car bombing rocked the Hilton hotel in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Taba late Thursday.
The explosion was followed by two smaller blasts at resort towns of Nuwaiba and Ras al Sultan in Sinai, dozens of kilometers southwest of Taba.
Israel on Friday blamed Al Qaeda for a series of bomb attacks in Egypt's Sinai peninsula that left at least 19 people and another 38 missing.
"According to our first information, it appears to be the an international terror attack with the hallmarks of Al Qaeda, Israel's deputy defence minister Zeev Boim said.
The attacks occurred late Thursday as the Red Sea coast of the southern Sinai was packed with Israeli holidaymakers celebrating the final day of the Jewish festival of Sukkot.
New York Times: Death toll is uncertain after three explosions strike resort towns.
Three explosions shook three Egyptian Sinai resorts popular with vacationing Israelis on Thursday night.
There were conflicting reports on the number of casualties.
Egypt said at least 30 people were killed, including 12 Egyptians.
But an Israeli official later said he could confirm only 14 or 15 dead, including five or six Israelis.
Earlier, Israel Radio had reported that at least 35 people were killed and more than 100 wounded.
Wall Street Journal: Blasts in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula kill at least 21, injure scores.
Blasts from a car bomb and a suicide bomber tore through a resort hotel in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula where Israelis were vacationing at the end of a Jewish holiday Thursday night, officials said.
There were at least 19 dead and the toll was likely to rise.
A car bomb and a suicide bomber set off twin blasts that tore through a resort hotel in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula where Israelis were vacationing at the end of a Jewish holiday Thursday night, killing at least 30 people and wounding more than 160, officials said.
Egypt said at least 30 people were killed including 12 Egyptians but an Israeli official later said he could confirm only 14 or 15 dead, including five or six Israelis.
He said, however, that more were buried under the rubble.
Israel Radio reported at least 35 people were killed.
The explosion was followed by two smaller blasts at other tourist sites in the Sinai that killed at least two Israelis.
Egyptian hospital officials said four people were killed in those explosions.
Two bombs exploded in quick succession at the Taba Hilton.
A car laden with explosives drove into the lobby of the hotel and detonated, while a suicide bomber blew up near the hotel swimming pool, the Israeli official said on condition of anonymity.
Egyptian officials were investigating the blasts, but could not confirm witness reports that car bombs caused all three.
The Taba blast collapsed a 10 story wing of the luxury Hilton hotel built by Israel when it controlled Taba from 1967 to 1989.
Israelis described a chaotic scene as the explosion brought the top floors of the hotel crashing into the lobby.
Meir Frajun said his three children were playing one floor below the lobby when the blast tore through the building.
He went down but found only two of them.
"Everything was filled with smoke," Frajun told The Associated Press after crossing into the nearby Israeli resort of Eilat.
"We were hysterically looking for the child.
In the end we found him sitting outside with an Arab guest of the hotel."
Four hours after the blast, Israel's military took command of the scene, according to the army spokeswoman, Brig.
Gen. Ruth Yaron, but there were delays in sending Israeli forces and rescue workers across the tense border.
The explosions came a month after the Israeli government urged citizens not to visit Egypt, citing a "concrete" terror threat to tourists in an area.
The warning, issued Sept 9 by the counterterrorism center in Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office, identified the Sinai Peninsula as the target of a potential attack.
The initial blast, about 10 p.m., rocked the Hilton hotel in the Taba resort, only yards from the Israeli border.
"The whole front of the hotel has collapsed.
There are dozens of people on the floor, lots of blood," witness Yigal Vakni told Army Radio.
Others were trapped in the debris, and the Israeli official said rescuers expected to find at least 10 more bodies.
Just before midnight, two smaller blasts struck the area of Ras Shitan, a camping area near the town of Nuweiba south of Taba, witnesses said.
Amsalem Farrag, whose uncle and cousin own camps in Ras Shitan, said both told him that cars exploded outside their camps.
The two blasts were only five seconds apart, he said.
He said the camps were full of vacationing Israelis.
No established groups have claimed responsibility for the bombing, but two previously unknown groups each said they carried it out.
Tawhid Islamic Brigades published a claim on a Web site that has been used frequently for such claims from Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
And Jamaa Al Islamiya Al Alamiya, or World Islamist Group, called an international news agency in Jerusalem.
Neither group offered detail of how it carried out the attack, as such claims usually do, and there was no way to confirm their authenticity.
Egyptian government spokesman Magdy Rady suggested the blasts were related to the Israeli military operation against the Palestinians in the neighboring Gaza Strip, where 84 Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli offensive that began on Sept 29 to stop militants from firing homemade rockets into Israel.
"I think the explosions are very related to what is going on in Gaza," Rady told AP.
"We condemn these attacks, which have harmed many people."
"I think it is very probable that there is a link between these three explosions," he added.
"It is very unlikely they happened by chance."
The security adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Jibril Rajoub, told Al Jazeera television that no Palestinian factions were responsible for the explosions.
Egypt upgraded a security alert at the airports in Cairo and in the southern tourist cities of Luxor, Hurghada and Aswan.
Police were searching cars coming in and out of Luxor and Hurghada and there was a heavy police presence around hotels.
Yaron, the Israeli army spokeswoman, said Israeli Brig.
Gen. Efi Idan "took command over the event in Taba" four hours after the blast.
She said, however, "We still have some trouble in sending over all of the forces and their equipment to Taba."
An Israeli foreign ministry spokeswoman said that Israel would help evacuate any of the 12000 to 15000 Israelis who wish to leave the Sinai.
Friday morning, thousands were streaming into Eilat, across the border.
Israel set up temporary accomodations in community centers, and Israeli radio reported a nationwide call for surgeons to get to Eilat.
Israel's Army Radio reported that initially, Egyptian policemen fired in the air at the Taba border crossing as dozens of Israelis tried to break through to get home.
Reporters from the Israeli side were unable to reach the scene, and no TV images were available several hours after the blast.
More than 100 rescue workers, many wearing hard hats, were later allowed to cross, and graders were seen clearing rubble at the site.
Egyptians reportedly allowed the teams in after Sharon instructed his diplomats to contact the Egyptians and expedite the crossing.
The two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979, but relations have been chilly as a result of Israeli military actions in Palestinian areas.
Rady said at least 30 people were killed and 160 injured in the Taba blast, and another seven Egyptians were injured in the Ras Shitan explosions.
Israel's rescue service said it evacuated 108 casualties to Israel, including one dead and 48 in serious condition.
An official at Taba Hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said his institution had taken in 25 bodies from the Taba explosion and two more from Ras Shitan.
An official at the Nuweiba hospital said two more bodies arrived there.
Taba is the main crossing between Israel and Egypt and the gateway for thousands of Israelis who travel to the hotels and resorts on the Red Sea.
Thursday was the last day of the weeklong Jewish festival of Sukkot, when thousands of Israelis vacation in the Sinai.
Egyptians also were in the midst of a long holiday weekend marking the anniversary of the start of the 1973 Arab Israeli war, so popular resort towns along the Sinai coast were packed.
Egypt has long struggled with Islamic militants interested in overthrowing the secular government, but has contained the threat with periodic crackdowns and by allowing Islamists some political activity.
The last major militant strike in Egypt was the 1997 massacre of 58 foreign tourists by Islamic extremists in the southern resort town of Luxor.
Rady said the explosions are sure to have a negative effect at least temporarily on Egypt's tourism industry, one of the country's economic mainstays.
"There will be damage definitely to the tourism in the area," he said, "but I hope it will not last long."
Associated Press correspondents Joe Federman in Eilat and Maggie Michael and Paul Garwood in Cairo contributed to this report.
A massive explosion tore off the front of a seaside hotel in the Egyptian resort of Taba late Thursday, killing at least 30 people and injuring more than 100 in what appeared to be a terrorist attack aimed at Israeli tourists, officials said.
The blast occurred at 10 p.m. at the Taba Hilton, a luxury high rise hotel on the Red Sea surrounded by palm trees and coral reefs, just a few hundred yards over the border from the southern tip of Israel.
The hotel, a popular venue for Middle East peace negotiators, was reportedly packed with Israeli tourists celebrating the end of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.
News service accounts from the area said two more explosions subsequently rocked the Red Sea resorts of Ras Shytan and Nuweiba, about 40 miles south of Taba, but details were sketchy.
One witness interviewed by Israeli television reported that two rockets were fired at his hotel in Ras Shytan, another said there was a huge blast that appeared to be from a car bomb.
Egyptian hospital officials cited by the Associated Press said four were killed in the two attacks.
At the Hilton, witnesses described scenes of horror and pandemonium when a huge blast occurred at the front of the hotel, catapulting bodies across the spacious lobby area, which has a large bar, a casino and huge plate glass windows looking out on a large salt water pool nestled along the Red Sea.
There were reports of large fires burning inside the hotel and people trapped under fallen debris.
The Associated Press reported that an entire 10 floor wing collapsed.
There were no official reports about the cause of the blast, but based on accounts from the scene and the extent of the damage, suspicion immediately focused on a possible car bomb detonated at the front of the building.
"The whole front of the hotel has collapsed.
There are dozens of people on the floor, lots of blood," said Yigal Vakni, an Israeli tourist interviewed by Israel's Army Radio.
"I am standing outside the hotel the whole thing is burning and they have nothing to put it out with."
"I was in my room on the fourth floor when suddenly I heard a tremendous explosion," a tourist identified only as Shimon told the Israeli Internet site Ynet.
"The explosion was in the entrance of the hotel, where the cars stop to drop off suitcases.
All the glass flew everywhere.
I saw a lot of injured people, at least two dead people next to the swimming pool."
Svetlana Ahmedallah, 33, said that she was in a room with her mother on the seventh floor when the blast occurred and that the building seemed to collapse.
The next thing she knew, Ahmedallah said, she was on the ground.
"I was lying in bed and my mother was in the bathroom when suddenly there was a strong explosion.
Everything flew, and I heard my mother shouting for help," Ahmedallah said.
She said she and her mother were in Taba on a two week vacation from their home in Tatarstan in Russia.
Ahmedallah, interviewed at a hospital just across the border from Egypt in Elat, where she was treated for minor injuries, said she apparently flew through a window.
She did not know what happened to her mother, but said she assumed her mother had died.
"I fell down to the ground on the bed.
The whole part of the building collapsed.
I don't know what happened."
Egyptian officials said they had no evidence of terrorism, the Associated Press reported.
Egyptian security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the explosion occurred among gas tanks in the hotel kitchen, which is next to the casino, where many tourists were at the time.
Egypt put the death toll at 30, and the Interior Ministry said 12 Egyptians were among the dead.
Israel Radio reported Friday that at least 35 people were killed.
After the explosion in Taba, many Israelis reportedly dropped everything and fled about 300 yards north to the official Israel Egypt border crossing.
Israeli officials said that after a period of confusion, Egyptian authorities began cooperating with Israeli fire and rescue personnel, allowing ambulances to cross the border to evacuate the wounded and search for those who remained trapped in the debris.
Moshe Moshiko, a fire department spokesman in Elat, said 30 firefighters were allowed to cross into Egypt to help, but others were turned away because they did not have their passports.
"They are trying to put out the fire and save people who are still trapped in the ruins of the hotel," he told Israel's Channel 10 television.
"The firefighters are climbing up through the hotel, floor by floor, to save the people inside."
Gideon Meir, a senior official in Israel's Foreign Ministry, said that in conversations with the Egyptian government, Israel had requested that Egypt permit free passage across the border for Israeli citizens and rescue personnel without passports, clearance for Israeli helicopters to fly to the scene of the attacks and permission for as many as 30 buses to travel down the coast to pick up any Israelis who wanted to leave.
The Egyptians responded that they would do "their utmost" to help, he said.
The Israel Defense Forces later took control of the scene at Taba.
A military convoy including seven ambulances and three buses went to the site in Nuweiba.
Last month, before the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah, the Foreign Ministry issued a travel advisory warning Israeli tourists not to travel to the Sinai Peninsula because of possible terrorist attacks.
But officials said they believed that between 12000 and 15000 Israeli tourists were in the Sinai on Thursday.
Israeli officials said they had no concrete information about who was behind the strikes.
But one senior government official noted the similarities between Thursday's attacks and previous attacks by al Qaida.
He cited in particular the multiple simultaneous strikes in other countries.
"It looks like al Qaida," he said.
"The characteristics of this attack are the same as Bali, Kenya, or even Madrid."
No established groups have asserted responsibility for the bombing, but two previously unknown Islamic groups each said they carried it out.
There was no way to confirm the authenticity of the claims.
Elat is one of Israel's most popular resorts, located at the very southern tip of the country where Israel, Egypt and Jordan converge at the end of a small finger of the Red Sea.
Joseftal Hospital there was inundated with wounded, said Naomi Halevy, a spokeswoman.
"More people are coming in every minute," she said in a telephone interview.
"It's a total mess."
Hospital officials reported receiving 112 injured.
There were few reliable reports about the other blasts.
Assaf Levy, a tourist who was staying at the Castle Beach Hotel in Ras Shytan, said he was relaxing with friends when suddenly a missile was fired from the long, high mountain range that runs along much of the coast.
"There was fire, a huge explosion, and we all ran outside," he told Israel's Channel 2.
"Two minutes later we saw another missile that fell in the parking lot of the Castle Beach.
Some people even ran towards the water and got into the sea because they were afraid of the missiles."
Aya Reich, 28, a lawyer from Tel Aviv, said she was dining with about 10 friends at a small beach community called Moon Island when "suddenly there was a strong explosion about 30 meters away from us, and everyone flew, and then a minute later there was another explosion, and we all started running towards the water."
"People were falling on top of each other," said Reich, who was wounded in the foot by shrapnel.
"Everyone was hysterical."
Special correspondent Samuel Sockol in Elat and researcher Hillary Claussen contributed to this report.
Israel on Friday blamed Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terror network for a series of anti Israeli bomb attacks against in Egypt's Sinai peninsula that left at least 19 people dead and another 38 missing.
"According to our first information, it appears to be an international terror attack with the hallmarks of Al Qaeda," Israel's deputy defence minister Zeev Boim said.
Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom echoed the accusations and told army radio: "Al Qaeda threatens all the countries, including Arab ones that according to it have close relations with Israel or the Western world."
"This would explain the recent attacks in Morocco, Istanbul or Riyadh," Shalom said of a series of deadly bombings in those cities.
"The struggle against terrorism is worldwide and we are far from having won it because organisations, not States, are behind it."
The attacks occurred late Thursday as the Red Sea coast of the southern Sinai was packed with Israeli holidaymakers celebrating the final day of the Jewish festival of Sukkot.
Earlier this month Al Qaeda number two Ayman al Zawahiri called on young Muslims to attack Israeli, Western and Asian interests across the world, specifically mentioning Egypt.
"It's the era of Muslim resistance, after the (Arab) governments submitted to the Zionist occupant.
We should learn the lesson of Chechnya, Afghanistan, of Iraq, of Palestine," a voice attributed to Zawahiri said on a tape aired by Al Jazeera on October 1.
"Don't wait for the American, British, French, South Korean, Hungarian and Polish forces to enter Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen and Algeria to start the resistance," the speaker added.
"We should start the resistance from now."
Zawahiri, a 53 year old Egyptian surgeon, is bin Laden's right hand man and reportedly his personal physician.
He was last heard in a videotape broadcast by the Qatar based news channel on September 9 in which he forecast a US defeat in Iraq and Afghanistan, and there had been unconfirmed rumours that he may have been killed.
But a US intelligence official said then that CIA analysts had concluded that the voice on the October 1 broadcast was indeed that of Zawahiri.
Israel will help evacuate any of the 12000 to 15000 Israelis who wish to leave Egypt's Sinai Peninsula in the wake of several deadly explosions, an Israeli foreign ministry spokeswoman said Friday.
"There is a plan to send buses to help them evacuate, those who want to," said the ministry's Rachel Shani.
Three explosions shook popular resorts on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula on Thursday night as many Israelis vacationed at the close of a Jewish holiday.
Hospital officials said at least 29 people were killed, and witnesses gave unconfirmed reports that all three explosions were caused by car bombs.
Egyptian security officials said there was no evidence of terrorism, but Israel's army radio said officials believed the Taba explosion was a car bomb, and witnesses at the other two sites told relatives that cars had exploded.
In the wake of three explosions that had killed at least 35 people in Egypt's Sinai Desert, Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom on Friday asked his Egyptian counterpart to help rescue Israeli wounded.
Quickly after the blasts, Shalom asked for Egyptian permission to allow Israelis to pass through the border without checks and to fly rescue workers into the Sinai.
He said Israel wants to send between 20 and 30 buses to the Sinai to bring home some 15000 Israelis still staying there.
After the explosions, the anti terror unit in the Prime Minister's Office called on all Israelis to leave Sinai immediately, and return to Israel, Israeli Army Radio reported.
An explosion ripped through the Hilton Hotel in the Egyptian resort town of Taba in the Sinai Desert on Thursday evening, close to the border with Israel.
Israeli Police said that at least 30 people had been killed in the blast, mostly Israeli tourists.
A source at Taba Hospital said that 114 people had been wounded.
Two other blasts occurred about two hours later at nearby resort towns of Ras Satan, a camping area full of Israeli tourists, and Nueiba, witnesses said.
Five people were killed in the twin blasts, and Egyptian television said 43 people were wounded.
Many Israelis have visited Egypt over the past month, during the period of Jewish holidays.
Last month, the defense establishment cautioned Israelis against traveling to Sinai, following warnings of a potential terrorist attack.
A suspected car bomb ripped through a hotel on the Red Sea coast of Egypt's Sinai desert late Thursday, one of three explosions targeting tourists that left at least 35 people dead and scores more wounded.
Israeli public television, citing a police source, said a car bomb detonated close to the entrance of the Hilton Hotel in the resort of Taba just across the border from Israel, destroying a large part of the building.
Shortly after the hotel blast, another two explosions rocked tourist camps at Shitani and Ras Soltan which lie on the coast road of the desert peninsula to the south of Taba.
An Egyptian police source said the three explosions killed at least 35 people and left another 125 wounded.
Earlier reports said at least 23 Israelis were killed in the Hilton blast.
The explosions occurred as Israelis were celebrating the end of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, and followed warnings from the country's intelligence services that Israelis should keep out of the Sinai desert.
"From the first information that we have received it could have been a car bomb attack," a senior Israeli foreign ministry official told AFP.
Hospital sources said the casualties were of different nationalities.
"I am standing in front of the hotel.
I heard a big explosion about 30 minutes ago that smashed all the windows.
The power went off," a witness who gave his name as Eitan told Israeli radio.
Egyptian public television had said earlier that the Hilton blast was caused by a gas leak.
The explosions came amid a massive Israeli army offensive in the north of the Gaza Strip, a wedge of land near the border with Egypt, that has left 93 Palestinians dead in less than 10 days.
Ambulances were seen shuttling across the border checkpoint between Taba and the Israeli resort of Eilat, where hospital staff wheeled bloodied victims on stretchers.
Resorts dotted along the Sinai's desert coast have remained popular holiday spots for Israelis since the territory was handed back to Egypt as part of a 1979 peace deal, the first between Israel and an Arab country.
But Taba was excluded from Israel's 1982 handover of the Sinai and was only returned in 1989 after years of wranging following a ruling by the International Court of Justice.
Ties between the two neighbours have soured since the start of the Palestinian intifada or uprising against Israeli occupation four years ago.
But thousands of Israeli tourists are still drawn to the Sinai, especially for its outstanding Red Sea diving and its hotel casinos, banned in the Jewish state.
The Jerusalem Post reported on September 11, after the government travel advisory, that vacationing Israelis were continuing to flock to the Sinai, despite repeated and increasingly dire official warnings of attacks.
"Because nothing has happened since previous warnings were issued, the public seems to be treating advisories from counter terrorism experts and the foreign ministry as akin to the boy who cried wolf," the paper said.
It estimated that over the past summer alone, around 300000 Israelis took holidays in Sinai, thus replacing Turkey as Israelis' most popular tourist destination.
Avi Dichter, the head of Israel's Shin Beth domestic security agency, told the cabinet on September 19 that prompt action had thwarted a plot by Palestinian militants to strike Israeli tourists in the Sinai.
Dichter said that the attack had been planned by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas to coincide with the Jewish new year holidays between September 15 and 18.
Suspected car bombs ripped through beach resorts packed with Israeli tourists on the Red Sea coast of Egypt's Sinai desert late Thursday, killing at least 30 people and causing carnage and chaos.
"We know dozens of Israelis have been killed," an Israeli police source said after a massive explosion devastated the vast Hilton hotel in Taba at the main border crossing point between Egypt and Israel.
Egyptian Tourism Minister Ahmed al Maghrabi put the toll at more than 30 dead and 100 wounded from the three explosions in Taba and two other resorts on the south Sinai coast.
The explosions occurred as Israelis were celebrating the end of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, and followed intelligence warnings that Israelis should keep out of the Sinai because of possible attacks.
Ambulances were shuttling across the border checkpoint between Taba and the Israeli resort of Eilat, where hospital staff wheeled in bloodied victims, including children, on stretchers.
"There was a terrible explosion.
In a matter of seconds everything had collapsed, it was awful," said Liron, a 24 year old Israeli woman.
"I saw bodies thrown into the sea," one firefighter told journalists after helping put out the fire at the Israeli built hotel.
"There was bloody everywhere."
Israeli police said the explosion was caused by a powerful car bomb detonated near the entrance to the four star Hilton, destroying a wing of the building.
South Sinai governor General Mustafa Afifi said two charred trucks were found at the Shitani and Ras Soltan camps on the coast road south of Taba, indicating that the blasts were also caused by car bombs.
Egypt threw up a security cordon around the blast sites in the Sinai renowned for its dramatic desert mountains and palm fringed beaches and boosted airport security in Cairo.
A previously unknown Islamist group claimed responsibility for the Hilton blast in a telephone call to AFP in Jerusalem.
"Jamaa Al Islamiya Al Alamiya (World Islamist Group) claims responsibility for the explosion at the Taba hotel, carried out in revenge for the Palestinian and Arab martyrs dying in Palestine and Iraq," the caller said.

At least 35 people were killed and 125 injured in three explosions targeting tourists in Egypt's Sinai desert region late Thursday, an Egyptian police source said.
He was unable to give their nationalities, but another police source told AFP earlier that at least 23 Israelis were among those killed and the Foreign Office in London said two of the wounded were Britons.
The explosion at the Hilton hotel in the Red Sea resort of Taba on the border with Israel was caused by at car bomb, Israeli public TV reported, citing a police source.
The source said the car bomb detonated close to the entrance of the hotel, destroying a large part of the building.
Egyptian police said two other explosions rocked nearby tourist camps further south in the Sinai peninsula.
At least seven Egyptian employees of one camp were among the injured, they said.
A blast ripped through the Hilton hotel in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Taba on Thursday evening, with medical sources saying at least 100 people had been killed or wounded.
The blast, the reasons for which were not immediately clear, killed or wounded at least 100 people of different nationalities, an Egyptian hospital source said.
At least 23 Israelis were killed in the blast, Egyptian police said.
Israeli radio reported that the blast was likely an attack, with an Israeli foreign ministry saying it could have been a car bomb attack, although the Egyptian public TV had earlier said the blast was due to a gas leak.
"An explosion caused by gas took place at a Taba hotel," Al Akhbar news channel said, without citing its sources.
"From the first information that we have received it could have been a car bomb attack," a senior Israeli foreign ministry official told AFP, requesting anonymity.
Shortly after the hotel blast, a second explosion was heard in the Sinai desert region of Nuaiba, between the Red Sea resorts of Taba and Sharm el Sheikh, an Egyptian police source said.
"At least seven people have been brought to the emergency room, one of them seriously wounded," Coby Arad of Yosseftal hospital in Eilat, across the border in Israel, told public radio.
But he said the number of casualties was likely to rise.
"I am standing in front of the hotel.
I heard a big explosion about 30 minutes ago that smashed all the windows.
The power went off," an Israeli witness who gave his name as Eitan, told the radio.
Israeli intelligence services have been warning Israeli holidaymakers to keep out of the Sinai desert, where Taba is located.
Israelis on Thursday night wound up the Jewish holidays of Sukkot.
Two explosions in tourist camps in Egypt's Sinai desert which followed a massive blast at a hotel in the resort of Taba late Thursday were probably caused by car bombs, the region's governor said.
Earlier, Israeli public television, citing a police source, said the explosion at the Hilton hotel in Taba was caused by a car bomb.
At least 30 people have been killed and 100 wounded in the three explosions along the Red Sea coast, an area popular with Israeli holidaymakers.
South Sinai governor General Mustafa Afifi said that two vans were found ablaze in two tourist camps south of Taba, which led him to believe the explosions were caused by car bombs.
Suspected car bombs ripped through a hotel and two beachside tourist sites on the Red Sea coast of Egypt's Sinai desert late Thursday, killing at least 30 people, most of them Israelis.
"We know dozens of Israelis have been killed," an Israeli police source said after a massive explosion devastated the Hilton hotel in Taba, a tiny town just across the border from Israel.
Egyptian Tourism Minister Ahmed al Maghrabi put the toll at more than 30 dead and 100 wounded from the three explosions in Taba and two other resorts on the south Sinai coast, an area popular with Israeli holidaymakers.
The explosions occurred as Israelis were celebrating the end of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, and followed intelligence warnings that Israelis should keep out of the Sinai because of possible attacks.
Ambulances were shuttling across the border checkpoint between Taba and the Israeli resort of Eilat, where hospital staff wheeled in bloodied victims, including children, on stretchers.
Israeli investigators believe a powerful car bomb detonated near the entrance to the four star Hilton, destroying much of the building.
Some debris from the vehicle used has been found by investigators, Israeli radio said.
South Sinai governor General Mustafa Afifi said two charred trucks were found at the two tourist camps of Shitani and Ras Soltan on the coast road of the desert peninsula south of Taba, suggesting that the blasts were also caused by car bombs.
"At this time of year, most guests at the Taba hotel are Israelis, along with a small number of Egyptians and some tourists of other nationalities," Maghrabi told AFP.
Egypt threw up a security cordon around the blast sites in the Sinai renowned for its dramatic desert mountains and palm fringed beaches and boosted airport security in Cairo.

Three explosions shook three Egyptian Red Sea resorts popular with vacationing Israelis on Thursday night, killing at least 35 people and wounding about 100, according to officials from Egypt, Israel and nearby hospitals.
Israeli officials said they believed the blasts were caused by terrorist bombs.
In the largest explosion, early reports suggested that a truck bomb may have been driven into the Taba Hilton, a large concrete resort hotel in a little village just across the Israeli border and near the Israeli resort town of Eilat.
The Hilton was badly damaged by the blast and an ensuing fire, and 10 floors in part of the complex collapsed.
There were reports of people buried in the rubble.
The two other explosions took place to the southwest, in the resort villages of Ras al Sultan and Nuweiba.
At least seven people died at Ras al Sultan, most of them Egyptian workers, according to the Egyptian media.
There was no other immediate information about casualties.
Last month, Israeli intelligence warned Israelis to keep out of the Sinai desert, citing vague but solid information about possible attacks.
No definitive claims of responsibility were publicized, thought Agence France Presse reported that someone claiming to be from a previously unknown group, Jamaa Al Islamiya Al Alamiya, or World Islamist Group, had taken responsibility for the Hilton blast in a telephone call to its bureau in Jerusalem.
The caller said the attack was "in revenge for the Palestinian and Arab martyrs dying in Palestine and Iraq," the agency reported.
Part of the Hilton apparently crumbled immediately after the blast.
"I heard a huge explosion," said Yigal Vakni, an Israeli at the Hilton who spoke to Israeli Army Radio.
"The wall near me collapsed and people began to run."
The blast was outside, he said.
"When we went out we saw the shops and the internal wall of the hotel had collapsed."
Many people were lying on the ground, he said: "There is a lot of blood, a lot of screaming."
An unidentified Israeli woman told Israeli television: "We immediately ran toward the beach, everyone running at once, and windows continue to shatter as we ran away.
Entire families were wounded, they ran to the beach and were covered with blood."
Panicked Israelis rushed the border post, trying to flee Egypt, yelling at the border guards in Arabic that their belongings and documents were still in the burning hotel.
Guards fired shots into the air to try to disperse them, before finally shutting the terminal temporarily.
Roads were blocked, leaving vacationing Israelis at other hotels trapped.
Hadas Manor, an Israeli journalist staying at another Taba hotel, told Israeli television: "Most of the people here haven't come with their cars, so they depend on Egyptian taxis that are not operating now."
Television footage at the border showed an Arab Israeli woman being carried by her husband.
As he put her down, she collapsed, and medics rushed to her.
Israeli television also showed scenes of ambulances arriving at Eilat hospitals and unloading the injured, many of them bandaged and bloody.
Others, apparently in shock, were wheeled in on stretchers.
Israeli television interviewed a man who described the blast near Ras al Sultan.
"We were sitting in a restaurant and suddenly heard a very powerful blast," the man, identified only as Yaniv, said.
"The electricity went out and rocks were jolted by the blast.
We then saw a second explosion not far from the first blast, it was a ball of fire higher on the mountain.
We immediately drove over to the site and found wounded people on the ground.
There were Israelis among them, they were bleeding in the sand and there was no one there to help them."
The warning about possible attacks came in an unusual public alert from Avi Dichter, the head of the Shin Bet intelligence service, not to go to Sinai resorts during the harvest festival season of Sukkot, when Israel shuts down.
He said there was vague but solid intelligence about a possible attack against Israeli tourists in Egypt's Sinai, where as many as 12000 Israelis were traveling for the holidays, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry.
The holiday this year began last week and ends Friday.
Since his warning, Israel has moved in force into the Gaza Strip that borders Egypt, trying to stop militant Palestinians like Hamas and Islamic Jihad from firing rockets into Israel.
Hamas has vowed retaliation against Israel and Israelis for the assassination of two of its leaders this year.
But Israeli officials suggested that an attack of this magnitude would have been planned carefully from within Egypt and was not tied to the Gaza operation.
Hamas, which has improving relations with Cairo, may not want to embarrass Egypt in this way, said Oded Granot, a commentator on Arab affairs.
He suggested that al Qaida, an offshoot or an Egyptian radical group might be responsible.
In November 2002, attackers drove a car bomb into a resort hotel popular with Israelis in Mombasa, Kenya, killing 12, and fired missiles at an Israeli charter jet, which only narrowly missed their target.
Israeli officials speculated Thursday night that militants, finding it increasingly difficult to attack Israelis in Israel itself, are choosing to attack them abroad.
The militants may also be trying to cause further strains between Israel and Egypt, which are trying to cooperate on the Israeli government plan for a unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.
Israel also regularly complains that Egypt should do more to stop the smuggling of arms into Gaza and that Cairo does not take its security responsibilities seriously enough.
The Egyptians say that Israel would best protect itself by making serious progress toward peace with the Palestinians, rather than by accelerating the cycle of violence.
But Egypt will not want the Israeli Palestinian struggle to spill across the border and is expected by Israeli officials to move quickly to try to track down those responsible.
The attacks may also be intended to damage Egypt's tourism industry, on which it depends heavily.
In 1997, after radicals attacked tourists in Luxor and killed nearly 70 people, Egypt cracked down hard on Islamic Jihad.
The Egyptian government at first suggested the Hilton explosion was caused by gas canisters and initially prevented Israeli rescue workers without passports from crossing the border to the hotel.
The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, spoke with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, and persuaded him to allow Israeli rescue workers to the scene without delay.
Yuval Steinitz, the chairman of parliament's foreign and defense committee, said: "What is sad is the fact that over recent months we have received incessant warnings concerning a possible attack in Sinai, and these warnings grew more and more clear, but the public failed to listen."
Taba is a small village dominated by the Hilton, originally built by the Israelis.
Israel returned the Sinai to Egypt in 1982 but claimed that Taba was inside Israel according to the international border.
International arbitrators disagreed, and Israel returned Taba, along with the expensive hotel, to Egypt in March 1989.
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have met numerous times at the hotel for peace talks.
Eyewitnesses told similar stories.
Hassan Elkhin told Israeli channel 10: "After the blast, parts of the wall and ceiling began to crumble.
I ran to look for my friends and found them downstairs in the casino.
I pulled them out and we managed to leave the hotel.
The walls around us collapsed, and there was fire around."
Standing outside the hotel, he said, "we watched as the rooms disappeared, they collapsed one after the other."
When asked if he wasn't afraid to travel to Sinai, Elkhin said: "I heard the alerts and warnings, but I never believed anything could ever happen there, because, after all, every one there is Israeli.
"Still," he said, "it happened."
Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot and wounded a companion during a weekend quail hunting trip in Texas, spraying the fellow hunter in the face and chest with shotgun pellets.
Harry Whittington, a millionaire attorney from Austin, was "alert and doing fine" in a Corpus Christi hospital Sunday, a day after he was shot by Cheney on a ranch in south Texas, said Katharine Armstrong, the property's owner.
He was described as in stable condition by Yvonne Wheeler, spokeswoman for the Christus Spohn Health System in Corpus Christi.
Armstrong in an interview with The Associated Press said Whittington, 78, was mostly injured on his right side, with the pellets hitting his cheek, neck and chest during the incident which occurred late afternoon on Saturday She said emergency personnel traveling with Cheney tended to Whittington until the ambulance arrived.
Cheney's spokeswoman, Lea Anne McBride, said the vice president was with Whittington and his wife at the hospital on Sunday.
The shooting was first reported by the Corpus Christi Caller Times.
The vice president's office did not disclose the accident until nearly 24 hours after it happened.
Armstrong said she was watching from a car while Cheney, Whittington and another hunter got out of the vehicle to shoot at a covey of quail.
Whittington shot a bird and went to look for it in the tall grass, while Cheney and the third hunter walked to another spot and discovered a second covey.
Whittington "came up from behind the vice president and the other hunter and didn't signal them or indicate to them or announce himself," Armstrong said.
"The vice president didn't see him," she continued.
"The covey flushed and the vice president picked out a bird and was following it and shot.
And by god, Harry was in the line of fire and got peppered pretty good."
Whittington has been a private practice attorney in Austin since 1950 and has long been active in Texas Republican politics.
He has been appointed to several state boards, including when then Gov. George W. Bush named him to the Texas Funeral Service Commission.
Whittington owns property in Travis County, which includes the state capital Austin, worth at least $11 million, the Austin American Statesman reported last year, not counting a downtown block at the center of a long running dispute with the city over a condemnation issue.
Armstrong, owner of the Armstrong Ranch where the accident occurred, said Whittington was bleeding and Cheney was very apologetic.
"It broke the skin," she said of the shotgun pellets.
"It knocked him silly.
But he was fine.
He was talking.
His eyes were open.
It didn't get in his eyes or anything like that."
"Fortunately, the vice president has got a lot of medical people around him and so they were right there and probably more cautious than we would have been," she said.
"The vice president has got an ambulance on call, so the ambulance came."
Cheney is an avid hunter who makes annual hunting trips to South Dakota to hunt pheasants.
He also travels frequently to Arkansas to hunt ducks.
Armstrong said Cheney is a longtime friend who comes to the ranch to hunt about once a year and is "a very safe sportsman."
She said Whittington is a regular, too, but she thought it was the first time the two men hunted together.
"This is something that happens from time to time.
You now, I've been peppered pretty well myself," said Armstrong.
Associated Press writer Paul Weber in Dallas contributed to this report.
Although he broke no laws, Vice President Dick Cheney did not have proper hunting credentials when he accidentally shot a fellow hunter at a private ranch last weekend, authorities said Monday.
Cheney, an experienced outdoorsman who had a valid out of state hunting license, will receive a warning citation for failing to purchase the required $7 stamp for bird hunting, the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife said in a statement.
The stamp is a new requirement, and the department has issued verbal warnings to many hunters who were unaware they needed it.
In a statement Monday night, Cheney's office said his staffers had not known about the stamp requirement and that Cheney had sent a $7 check to Texas to cover the cost.
The accident occurred Saturday when the vice president wheeled to shoot at a covey of quail and accidentally sprayed his hunting partner, 78 year old attorney Harry Whittington, with bird shot, authorities said.
Whittington was moved out of the intensive care unit at a hospital here Monday and reported to be in good spirits.
"This was a hunting accident," said Gilbert San Miguel, chief deputy of the Kenedy County Sheriff's office.
"There was no alcohol or misconduct."
But the incident has reverberated worldwide: "Cheney bags a lawyer," was the headline in the Glasgow, Scotland based Herald.
And it has forced a White House already under fire for secrecy to explain why it made no mention of the shooting until the ranch owner disclosed it to a local newspaper, 18 hours after the incident.
White House press secretary Scott McClellan said Monday that the "first priority was making sure that Harry Whittington ,was getting the medical care that he needed.
And I think that's where everybody's attention should have been focused, and was focused, when the hunting accident took place."
Still, McClellan blamed Whittington for the accident, noting that the attorney left the hunt line to retrieve a downed quail and was approaching Cheney from behind.
"The protocol was not followed by Mr Whittington when it came to notifying the others that he was there," McClellan said.
"And so, you know, unfortunately these type of hunting accidents happen from time to time."
But hunting experts said that, although Whittington should have made his location clear, the vice president is also to blame for not keeping track of his companions.
"You're hunting together you need to know where everyone is," said Larry Keane, general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation.
Said Jeff Hart, an Austin lawyer who hunts for quail in Texas: "If you pull the trigger, you're responsible for it, no matter what,In hunting, the shooter is responsible for knowing where the shot is going.
That's the bottom line."
Cheney, well known for having testy relations with the media, on Monday came under criticism from Democrats and Republicans who said the White House should have disclosed the incident immediately.
"It's news, and it reflects an attitude in this White House of holding back information, of being too clever by half and being secretive," conservative columnist Robert Novak said on Fox News.
"On the face of it, this looks like something the administration felt the public had no right to know," Joe Lockhart, who was President Clinton's press secretary, said in an interview.
"I don't think there's going to be a bunch of people sitting around saying: 'I wonder why they waited to tell us.'
But what they will be saying is: 'I wonder what else they're not telling us.'
" Whittington a prominent Austin attorney and the vice president arrived for a weekend hunting trip Friday night at the 50000 acre Armstrong ranch, a well known retreat for wealthy Texas Republicans 95 miles south of Corpus Christi.
The party of 11 hunters set out in two trucks Saturday morning, driving around the mesquite dotted property and shooting quail until about 12:30 p.m., said Anne Armstrong, co owner of the ranch.
Then they broke for a lunch of antelope, jicama salad and camp bread, washed down with Dr Pepper.
After lunch, the group split up.
Cheney, Whittington and Pamela Willeford, a former Texas energy executive who is now the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, went with two of Armstrong's daughters and pursued quail for several more hours.
It was at dusk that Whittington shot his bird and went to retrieve it, taking him behind the vice president.
The medical team that travels with Cheney immediately began ministering to Whittington, who was bleeding profusely from pellets in his face, neck and chest, according to witnesses.
They packed the wounded attorney into Cheney's ambulance and drove him to a nearby hospital.
It was evident that the injuries were not life threatening, Armstrong said, because the ambulance paused on the road for several minutes to allow Whittington's wife to join them.
After being stabilized at the hospital in Kingsville, Whittington was evacuated by helicopter to a larger facility in Corpus Christi where he was placed in the intensive care unit.
The Secret Service reported the shooting to the Kenedy County sheriff's office, although no one from that agency interviewed Cheney until Sunday morning.
When asked whether the Secret Service had prevented him from talking to the vice president right after the shooting, San Miguel said: "I'd rather not say."
Anne Armstrong said that on Saturday evening, Cheney spoke with her about disclosing the incident to the public.
"We knew word would get out," she said.
The vice president urged her to tell friends and family first, before word leaked out to the media.
Late Sunday morning, her daughter, Katharine Armstrong, called a reporter from the Corpus Christi Caller, which then reported the shooting on its Web site.
Peter Binko, administrator of Christos Spohn hospital in Corpus Christi where Whittington was recuperating, said the injured hunter was cracking jokes and was baffled by all the publicity.
"He's a true Southern gentleman," Binko said of Whittington at a Monday news conference.
"He's really amazed, I think, at all the hoopla over this."
Whittington is a fixture in Texas politics, having worked in Republican campaigns dating back to John Tower's senatorial run in the 1960s.
He's best known nowadays for a decades long battle to prevent the city of Austin from building a parking lot over a downtown block that he owns.
The dispute is still being litigated.
Riccardi reported from Corpus Christi and Gerstenzang from Washington.
Times staff writers Lianne Hart in Corpus Christi and Peter Wallsten in Washington contributed to this report.
The White House on Monday carefully distanced itself from Vice President Dick Cheney's delayed notification about his accidental shooting of a hunting companion.
White House Press Secretary McClellan said he had privately urged Cheney's staff to quickly disclose details about the 5:30 p.m. CST accident on Saturday rather than wait for the Texas ranch owner to telephone the local newspaper more than 18 hours later, on Sunday.
McClellan said he was informed late Saturday night that there had been a hunting accident but didn't learn that Cheney had shot the victim until 6 a.m. EST Sunday.
McClellan said President Bush learned there had been a hunting accident from White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card about 7:30 p.m. EST Saturday and learned that Cheney had been the shooter shortly before 8 p.m. EST when updated by Deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove.
Cheney's staff did not publicly confirm the accidental shooting until 3:30 p.m. EST on Sunday, more than 20 hours after the accident, when the Corpus Christi Caller Times posted a story on its Web site.
McClellan said spoke with Katharine Armstrong, one of the ranch owners and an eyewitness to the accident, and she agreed to relay word of the accident to the local newspaper on Sunday.
McClellan said he had urged speedy public disclosure following the incident at the 50000 acre Armstrong Ranch some 60 miles outside Corpus Christi, Texas.
"I think it's always important to get information out as quickly as possible," McClellan said.
"Of course in a position like mine, I was urging that that information be made available as quickly as possible."
McClellan attributed some of the delay to Cheney's aides trying to "get the facts together (to) provide that information to the public" as well as making sure that Cheney's victim, 78 year old Texas lawyer Harry Whittington, had adequate medical attention.
But McClellan sought to deflect criticism about the slow disclosure by suggesting that Cheney's staff was responsible.
"It was the vice president's office that took the lead on this," he said, when asked about whether he had been told that Cheney's staff was relying on a private citizen to report the accident.
Whittington, an Austin lawyer, was listed Monday in "very stable" condition at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial in Corpus Christi, Texas, where he was undergoing treatment for multiple pellet wounds on the right side of his lower face, neck, shoulder and chest.
Hospital administrator Peter Banko said Whittington was moved out of intensive care on Monday.
Cheney, 65, was using a .28 gauge shotgun when he accidentally peppered Whittington with bird shot at a distance of about 30 yards while trying to shoot flushed quail.
The Corpus Christi Caller Times reported Monday that Cheney and Whittington had been hunting with Pam Willeford, the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein who had served for eight years on the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
The vice president's office did not publicly report the accident until mid afternoon Sunday after the Corpus Christi Caller Times had asked about it.
McClellan contrasted the delayed notification by a private citizen with his own quick actions last July when he notified the news media that Bush had collided with a member of his Scottish security detail while bicycling in Scotland during an international summit.
McClellan immediately disclosed that Bush had suffered "mild to moderate" scrapes on his arms and hands that required bandages by the White House physician.
McClellan, drawing a distinction with the response by Cheney's staff, told reporters Monday: "I think you can always look back at these issues and look at how to do a better job."
OPTIONAL TRIM STORY MAY END HERE McClellan and the Corpus Christi Caller Times provided the following timeline: Saturday, Feb 11: 5:30 p.m. CST Cheney accidentally shoots Whittington.
He is flown by helicopter to a hospital in Corpus Christi and admitted to the trauma intensive care unit.
7:30 p.m. EST White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card in Washington alerts Bush at the White House about an unspecified shooting accident within Cheney's quail hunting party but does not specify that Cheney was the shooter.
8 p.m. EST Deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove updates Bush, telling the president that Cheney was the shooter.
Sunday, Feb 12: 6 a.m. EST McClellan is awakened at home and told that Cheney was the shooter.
He says he began urging vice presidential staff to release details of the incident.
Sunday morning Katharine Armstrong, the host and an eyewitness to the accident, says she and her mother, former U.S. Ambassador to Britain Anne Armstrong, ask Cheney about notifying the news media.
"The vice president spoke with (Katharine Armstrong) directly and agreed that she should make it public and that they would provide additional information," McClellan said.
Katharine Armstrong starts trying to telephone Jaime Powell, a reporter at the Corpus Christi Caller Times, to describe the accident.
Asked whether it was appropriate to have a private citizen relay information about the vice president, McClellan quipped: "That's one way to provide information to the public."
Sunday morning Cheney talks by telephone with Merce Whittington, Whittington's wife, to check on the victim's condition.
Sunday afternoon Cheney visits Whittington at the Corpus Christi hospital before returning to Washington, D.C. 3:30 p.m. EST News organizations confirm the Corpus Christi Caller Times account with vice president's office at the White House.
Monday morning Cheney arrives at the White House complex in his motorcade, with escorting police vehicles forgoing the usual sirens.
He ducks from his limousine into the White House wearing a black jacket with the collar raised against the early morning chill.
Armstrong did not immediately return a telephone call seeking additional comment.
She told the Corpus Christi Caller Times that Whittington had come up behind Cheney without alerting him that he was here.
"The reason that you stay in line is so that you know where everybody is at all times," Armstrong told the newspaper.
"If you drop out of line, you say you are coming up behind to indicate to other shooters so (they) know you are there."

US Vice President Dick Cheney did not have a legal permit to hunt quail when he accidentally shot a 78 year old hunting partner over the weekend, the White House said on Monday.
The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department informed Cheney that he lacked a stamp for hunting "upland game birds" in the state when the shooting incident occurred, the vice president's office said in a statement.
Texas authorities said they would issue a warning citation to Cheney but impose no penalty or fine for failing to have the seven dollar stamp.
The revelation was sure to aggravate a public relations headache for the White House, already under criticism for waiting a day to disclose the shooting incident.
Cheney shot prominent lawyer Harry Whittington in the neck and chest with birdshot on Saturday as the two were out quail hunting on a Texas ranch.
Whittington's condition was improving and described as "stable" by doctors at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial, where he was treated for wounds to his shoulder, upper body, chest and neck.
News of the shooting was first revealed not by the White House but by the owner of the south Texas ranch, Katharine Armstrong, where the incident took place.
Armstrong spoke to the local newspaper, the Corpus Christi Caller Times, which had called her after getting a tip.
President George W. Bush's spokesman Scott McClellan as well as Cheney spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride insisted that the delay between the incident and its confirmation by the White House was due to a focus on securing Whittington medical care.
McClellan also said that details about the shooting were trickling in throughout the night and that the White House needed "to get the facts together."
"It was an accident.
Unfortunately, these types of hunting accidents do happen from time to time," the spokesman told a frequently contentious briefing with reporters.
Asked why getting Whittington medical attention was incompatible with releasing details of the incident, McClellan said that the vice president's office had "worked to get that information out."
But the Caller Times reported Monday that McBride, after confirming the incident around noon (1800 GMT) on Sunday, had refused to say whether the vice president's office would have disclosed the incident if the daily had not contacted her after getting a tip from an unnamed Armstrong family member.
"I'm not going to speculate," the daily quoted her as saying.
Confirming Armstrong's account, local police and state game officials said the vice president had spun around to target a bird and shot his fellow hunter instead.
"The investigation reveals that there was no alcohol, or misconduct involved in the incident," the Kenedy County sheriff's office said in a statement.
An interview with Whittington had confirmed Cheney's account, the sheriff's office said.
The Caller Times also reported Monday that the US ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein, Pamela Willeford, was part of the hunting party.
An incident report by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said that Whittington had gone to retrieve a downed bird when Cheney wheeled around with his 28 gauge Perazzi shotgun and shot him by accident.
The weather was sunny and "clear" when the accident occurred and both men were wearing blaze orange hats and vests, the report said.
The Dallas Morning News reported that Whittington also lacked the proper stamp for hunting quail.
Gaming officials said they had been issuing oral warnings instead of fines to hunters who had failed to update their licenses under the new rule.
Cheney's staff members had asked state authorities for all necessary permits beforehand and were never informed about the need for a seven dollar stamp for quail hunting, his office said in its statement.
While awaiting a warning from game wardens, "the Vice President has sent a 7 dollar check to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, which is the cost of an upland game bird stamp," it said.
The incident made the front pages of The Washington Post, The New York Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal, most of which noted soberly that Cheney's office had not gone public with the information when it happened.
Late night talk show hosts, who typically mine such incidents for laughs, were not broadcasting over the weekend, making Monday night the first time they will be able to train their sights on the mishap.
Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally sprayed a companion with birdshot while hunting quail on a private Texas ranch, injuring the man in the face, neck and chest, the vice president's office confirmed yesterday after a Texas newspaper reported the incident.
The shooting occurred late Saturday afternoon while Cheney was hunting with Harry Whittington, 78, a prominent Austin lawyer, on the Armstrong Ranch in south Texas.
Hearing a covey of birds, Cheney shot at one, not realizing that Whittington had startled the quail and that he was in the line of fire.
Whittington was treated on the scene by Cheney's traveling medical detail before being taken by helicopter to a Corpus Christi hospital.
He was in the intensive care unit at Christus Spohn Health System and listed in stable condition yesterday evening.
Katharine Armstrong, the ranch's owner, saw what happened Saturday and told reporters Sunday that Cheney was using a 28 gauge shotgun, which shoots fewer pellets and has a smaller shot pattern than a 12 gauge shotgun, making hitting the target more challenging.
Whittington was about 30 yards away when he was hit in the cheek, neck and chest, she said.
The White House drew fire Monday for not immediately disclosing that Vice President Dick Cheney had shot a 78 year old hunting partner in a weekend incident not reported until a day after it took place.
There was still no official account of the events on Katherine Armstrong's south Texas ranch on Saturday, when Cheney missed his quail quarry but hit prominent lawyer Harry Whittington in the neck and chest with birdshot.
And Bush spokesman Scott McClellan battled criticism over the decision by Cheney's office to let Armstrong a private citizen with no official White House role make the news public by informing her local newspaper.
"I think you can always look back at these issues and look at how to do a better job," mused McClellan, who said he had advocated full disclosure and left little doubt that he would have handled the situation differently.
Bush knew an hour after the fact that a hunting accident had taken place at 5:30 pm (2330 GMT), and it took him another 30 minutes to find out that Cheney had pulled the trigger, said McClellan.
Breaking with precedent, the White House did not disclose the information to the national media that cover Bush and Cheney.
The news first came to light on Sunday at 1:48 pm (1948 GMT), when the Corpus Christi Caller Times published Armstrong's account on its Internet site.
Cheney and Armstrong "agreed that she should make that information public.
She was an eyewitness, she saw what occurred and she called her local paper to provide those facts," said McClellan.
Whittington was in stable condition in the intensive care unit at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial, were he was treated for wounds to his shoulder, upper body, chest and neck, said hospital spokeswoman Michele Mora Trevino.
Cheney aides continued to decline requests for an official timeline and details of the incident, pointing reporters to Armstrong's account and vouching for its accuracy.
McClellan as well as Cheney spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride insisted that the time gap between the incident and its confirmation by the White House was due to a focus on getting Whittington the medical care he needed.
McClellan also said that details about the shooting were trickling in throughout the night and that the White House needed "to get the facts together."
"It was an accident.
Unfortunately, these types of hunting accidents do happen from time to time," the spokesman told a frequently contentious briefing with reporters.

"I'm not going to speculate," the daily quoted her as saying.
"When you put the call into me, I was able to confirm that account."
Armstrong has said that Whittington came up noiselessly behind the vice president, who spun around to target a bird and shot his fellow hunter instead.
The incident made the front pages of The Washington Post, The New York Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal, most of which noted soberly that Cheney's office had not gone public with the information when it happened.

U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot and injured a hunting companion in Texas over the weekend, U.S. media reported Sunday.
Harry Whittington, Cheney's hunting companion during a quail hunting trip in Texas on Saturday, was mostly injured on his right side, with shotgun pellets hitting his cheek, neck and chest, the reports said.
Whittington, 78, was "alert and doing fine" in the hospital, Katharine Armstrong, owner of the Armstrong Ranch in south Texas, was quoted by CNN as saying.
Cheney spent time with Whittington, a lawyer from Austin, and his wife at the hospital on Sunday, CNN said.
Whittington shot a bird and was looking for it in the tall grass, while Cheney and the third hunter walked to another spot and found a second covey, Armstrong said.
She said Cheney didn't see Whittington, and when he chose a bird to shoot, he accidentally hit Whittington, who was "in the in the line of fire."
Whittington was bleeding, but he was not very seriously injured, she said.
Cheney was very apologetic, she added.
Globe Staff WASHINGTON Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot a hunting partner Saturday in Texas, and the White House did not confirm the shooting until nearly 20 hours later.
The victim was described as being "peppered pretty good" with birdshot and was in stable condition Sunday.
Cheney shot Harry Whittington, 78, a multimillionaire Austin lawyer, spraying his friend and hunting partner with shotgun pellets from head to chest.
He was being treated in the intensive care unit at a Corpus Christi hospital.
Whittington, bloodied but still conscious, tumbled to the ground after he was hit.
Cheney thought he was shooting at a covey of quail, according to an owner of the ranch.
Cheney is a longtime hunter and delivered the keynote address in 2004 to the National Rifle Association, from which he accepted a rifle as a gift.
The accident happened in south Texas at the famed Armstrong Ranch, co owned by members of a family long close to Cheney.
Tobin Armstrong was a major financial backer of the Bush Cheney team who died last October, with Cheney attending the funeral.
Anne Armstrong, a former counselor to President Nixon, has served on the board of the Halliburton Corp., where Cheney was chief executive before becoming vice president.
Whittington is a longtime friend of President Bush from their days together in Austin when Bush was Texas governor.
He was described in an article published two weeks ago in the Austin American Statesman as being "very rich, very stubborn, and very patient."
The Associated Press quoted Katharine Armstrong, one of the ranch owners, as saying she watched the shooting from her vantage in a nearby car.
She said that Whittington shot a quail and went to look for it in the grass.
Cheney then went to search for more quail.
Cheney was using a 28 gauge shotgun and was about 30 yards away from Whittington, she said.
Both men were wearing orange vests.
Whittington "came up from behind the vice president and the other hunter and didn't signal them or indicate to them or announce himself," Armstrong told the Associated Press.
"The vice president didn't see him.
The covey flushed and the vice president picked out a bird and was following it and shot.
And, by God, Harry was in the line of fire and got peppered pretty good."
Armstrong said Whittington was injured mostly on his right side, from cheek to chest.
Cheney was described as apologetic for shooting Whittington.
He was taken by medical helicopter to the Christus Spohn Health System in Corpus Christi, about an hour away.
Cheney was described as apologetic for shooting Whittington.
The vice president visited Whittington in the hospital Sunday, Armstrong said.
"It broke the skin," Armstrong said, referring to the birdshot.
"It knocked him silly.
But he was fine.
He was talking.
His eyes were open.
It didn't get in his eyes or anything like that."
The shooting occurred about 5:30 p.m. local time Saturday and was first reported on the website of the Corpus Christi Caller Times at midday Sunday, according to a reporter at the newspaper.
The White House confirmed the shooting after being contacted by the media.
White House spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride, asked in a telephone interview why the shooting was not announced sooner, referred questions to Katharine Armstrong.
McBride said Armstrong talked to "her local paper and when we were asked about the account she had provided, we confirmed that."
Armstrong did not return a call seeking comment on McBride's statement.
After the hospital visit, McBride said Cheney "was pleased to see that he was doing fine and in good spirits."
Cheney, who suffered four heart attacks before he was elected vice president and has been hospitalized for heart problems while in office, always travels with a medical team.
His team treated Whittington before he was taken to the hospital.
Bush, who owns a ranch in Texas, and Cheney, who grew up in Wyoming, are both enthusiastic hunters, a fact they have frequently mentioned during political campaigns.
McBride said Cheney has a Texas hunting license.
Cheney's hunting trips have included one with Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who went duck hunting in January 2004 with the vice president in Louisiana, a trip criticized because Scalia participates in decisions that affect the administration.
Tobin Armstrong was quoted by the Associated Press as saying in 2000 that he frequently went hunting on the ranch with Cheney, who turned 65 last month.
When Armstrong died in October, his funeral was attended by Cheney and former President George H. W. Bush.
"Tobin is one of our dearest and most respected friends," former President Bush said.
"Barbara and I loved Tobin Armstrong."
The 50000 acre Armstrong Ranch was purchased in 1852 by Tobin Armstrong's grandfather, John Armstrong III, who became known for capturing outlaw John Wesley Hardin, according to a profile of the ranch in the Caller Times.
Whittington has long been active in Republican Party politics and was appointed by then Governor George W. Bush to the Texas Funeral Service Commission.
In the final stages of the 2004 campaign, Cheney mocked the way Democratic presidential nominee Senator John F. Kerry went on a hunting trip.
"He wore a brand new camouflage jacket for the occasion, which makes you wonder just how often he does really go goose hunting," Cheney said, according to a White House transcript.
"My personal opinion was his camo jacket was an October disguise,But, my fellow sportsmen, this coverup isn't going to work because you and I know the Second Amendment is more than just another photo opportunity."
The Houston Chronicle has reported that there were 29 hunting related accidents in Texas in 2004, with four fatalities.
The man accidentally shot by US Vice President Dick Cheney while the two were hunting on a southern Texas ranch is in stable condition, a hospital spokeswoman said Monday.
Harry Whittington, 78, was peppered with shotgun pellets after Cheney turned to shoot quail that had just been flushed out of the brush, Cheney spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride confirmed Sunday.
"He remains in stable condition in our ICU (intensive care unit)," Michele Mora Trevino, a spokeswoman for Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial in Corpus Christi, Texas told AFP.
"The area affected was his shoulder, upper body, chest and some of the neck area," she said.
"It was like a spraying.
It wasn't a direct hit."
Whittington was admitted at 8:15 pm on Saturday following the accident and remained in the intensive care unit on Monday morning.
"He's in good health, he's doing well," Mora Trevino said, adding that a release date had not yet been set for the prominent Texas lawyer.
The White House sought with little success on Monday to quell an uproar over why it took the better part of a day to disclose that Vice President Dick Cheney had accidentally wounded a fellow hunter in Texas on Saturday and why even President Bush initially got an incomplete report on the shooting.
The victim, Harry Whittington, a 78 year old lawyer, was transferred from the intensive care unit to a private room in a Corpus Christi hospital on Monday.
His condition remained listed as stable, with wounds to his face, neck, chest and rib cage from the pellets sprayed at him from 30 yards away by Cheney's shotgun.
Calls to his room were routed to the hospital's marketing department, which said it was taking messages for him.
Texas officials said on Monday night that Cheney would be issued a warning citation for hunting without a proper game stamp on his license.
The local sheriff said an investigation had concluded that the episode was "no more than an accident."
At the White House, Cheney made no statement and remained out of public view on Monday.
At the end of a meeting with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Cheney and Bush exchanged remarks that reporters were about to enter the room, and the vice president left before the journalists arrived.
But Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, was battered at his daily news briefing by journalists demanding answers to why Cheney had not been faster to make public what happened and why he had chosen a local newspaper in Texas as his vehicle for doing so.
The pressure came in part from questions about whether Cheney might have been trying to play down the incident, a suggestion that was rejected by those who were with Cheney over the weekend.
Among the people with him at the Armstrong Ranch in south Texas was his host Katharine Armstrong, a lobbyist and longtime friend of Cheney.
Her lobbying clients include several that do business with the federal government, though Armstrong said she did not believe that she had ever lobbied Cheney.
In an interview, Armstrong said that it did not occur to anyone in the hunting party to make news of the shooting public immediately, but that no one, including Cheney, had called for holding it back.
She said Cheney participated in discussions on Sunday morning about disclosing the incident, agreeing that it should be made public but deferring to the Armstrong family on how to do so.
On Sunday morning, Armstrong tipped off her local newspaper to the story.
It was later picked up by national wire services and confirmed by Cheney's office.
The incident provided a wealth of material for Democrats, gun control activists and critics of the Bush administration, not to mention late night comedians.
McClellan struggled at times to explain even the most basic details in the case, including when and how Bush was informed about it.
In the end, White House officials said Bush learned about the shooting accident at 7:30 p.m. Eastern time, about an hour after it happened, in a call from Andrew H. Card Jr., his chief of staff.
But Bush did not find out that Cheney was the shooter until about half an hour later in a subsequent call from Karl Rove, his senior adviser and deputy chief of staff, who had called Armstrong to ask about the incident.
The local sheriff, Ramon Salinas 3rd, said the Secret Service called him shortly after the shooting occurred.
Salinas said he sent his chief deputy, Gilbert Sanmiguel, to the Armstrong ranch that night.
He said Sanmiguel interviewed the Cheney and reported that shooting was an accident.
The sheriff said Sunday that they had yet to speak to "the victim."
"But you could say it's closed," Salinas said of the case.
On Monday, a news release from the sheriff's office said that " Whittington's interview collaborated Vice President Cheney's statement" and that the department was "fully satisfied that this was no more than a hunting accident."
There is no requirement to report nonfatal hunting accidents in Texas, said Lydia Saldana, the communications director for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.
In a statement on Monday night, Cheney's office said a member of his staff had asked the Parks and Wildlife Department for all of the necessary permits for the vice president to go quail hunting in Texas and had paid $140.
But, the statement said, the staff member was not informed of the need for an additional stamp, costing $7, to allow hunting of upland game birds.
The statement said Cheney has now sent a $7 check to the department.
Cheney has often gone hunting as vice president, sometimes with other prominent officials, including Justice Antonin Scalia.
During the 2004 presidential campaign, Cheney mocked Sen John Kerry, the Democratic nominee, for having worn camouflage on a duck hunting trip, saying Kerry's "new camo jacket is an October disguise, an effort he's making to hide the fact that he votes against gun owner rights at every turn."
This past weekend brought Cheney together with a group of old friends, friends of friends and political supporters in the kind of private setting he relishes.
The guests included Pamela Pitzer Willeford, a Texan who was appointed ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein in 2003.
She was with Cheney at the time of the shooting, as was Armstrong, whose mother, Anne, is a prominent Republican supporter and whose family ranch is a familiar destination for Republican politicians.
According to public documents, Armstrong registered in 2004 as a lobbyist for Parsons, an engineering and construction firm that has done extensive work in Iraq, and listed the size of the contract at more than $100000, according to lobbying records from the Texas Ethics Commission provided by Texans for Public Justice, a watchdog group.
Armstrong's business partner, Karen Johnson, spent several years lobbying for Parsons, doing work on "business development" before the State Department, the Department of Transportation and the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to PoliticalMoneyLine, which tracks federal lobbying.
Johnson also lobbies for major corporations, including Lockheed Martin, and has been one of Bush's leading fund raisers.
Armstrong has a relatively limited list of lobbying clients in Texas and in Washington.
Public records show that she has worked for Baker Botts, the law firm, Prionics AG, a biotechnology company, Trajen, a firm that performs aviation technical support for the U.S. military, and the King ranch, the property next to her family's ranch.
Records in Texas indicate that she has lobbied at the state level for three companies: Avex Group, the Dannenbaum Engineering Corporation and Ecocreto USA.
Armstrong played down her role as a lobbyist and suggested that she had not brought up business during Cheney's visit.
She was appointed to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission in 1999 by Bush, who was then the Texas governor.
"You need to understand that the Cheneys are our friends maybe for a couple of decades, maybe 30 years," Armstrong said, adding that she did not personally represent Parsons.
"I represent a couple of Texas companies, not a large lobbying practice," she said.
Armstrong said she does more public relations and consulting work than lobbying, but she declined to disclose her clients.
She none were involved in Iraq "that I know of."
Asked if she was concerned that Cheney's visit could create the appearance of impropriety during the lobbying investigation involving Jack Abramoff, which has brought to light the often close personal and professional ties between lobbyists and public officials, she said: "Oh my God, he's a friend.
I don't believe I've ever lobbied the vice president, nor would I be comfortable doing so."
According to Armstrong and Willeford, the accident was largely the fault of Whittington, who reappeared alongside two of his hunting companions without giving proper warning.
Cheney, who was carrying a 28 gauge shotgun, had already begun to fire and sprayed Whittington.
"He got peppered pretty good," Armstrong said.
"He fell with his head toward me."
She said she ran over to Whittington, who had fallen to the ground, but stayed out of the way while Secret Service agents tended to him.
"There was some bleeding, but it wasn't horrible," she said.
"He was more bruised."
Willeford, whose husband was also at the ranch, said in an interview that Whittington accepted responsibility for the accident.
"He understands that he could have handled it better," Willeford said.
"Harry should have let us know he was back there."
Willeford and her husband are substantial Republican donors, they gave more than $11000 to Republican causes, including the Bush campaign and the Republican National Committee, in the 2004 election cycle.
Vice President Dick Cheney's public mea culpa Wednesday did little to clear up significant questions surrounding the accidental shooting, including why the White House sat on the story for almost a full day and whether he received preferential treatment from local deputies.
Here is a look at some of those questions: Q ) Why didn't the White House notify the public immediately Saturday night that the vice president accidentally shot a man?
A ) Cheney makes it clear that it was his decision to wait almost a full day to go public.
But he doesn't indicate why top Bush aides like Karl Rove and even President Bush himself appear to have deferred to him on it.
Q ) Why didn't Cheney just put the word out Saturday night to avoid risking charges coming from critics now of a cover up?
A ) Cheney said he waited overnight to find out how seriously victim Harry Whittington was hurt and to avoid rushing out inaccurate information.
Q ) Did Rove, Bush chief of staff Andrew Card or even Bush himself want Cheney to go public Saturday night?
A ) Unknown.
In one of the more striking statements from the nation's No. 2 leader, Cheney says he didn't personally speak to anyone at the White House until Sunday morning, despite having been involved in the shooting accident the night before.
Rove told Bush at about 8 p.m. Saturday that Cheney was the shooter roughly an hour after the shooting occurred.
Q ) The White House has an elaborate media operation why did Cheney bypass it and the national media outlets that cover the White House around the clock?
A ) Also unclear.
Cheney said only that he had no spokesperson traveling with him, even though his traveling staff can be in 24 7 contact with the White House.
But Cheney has done little in his five years in office to disguise his disdain for the national media.
Q ) How did Cheney decide to alert the news media?
A ) On Sunday, ranch owner Katharine Armstrong initially told CNN that she tipped off the local newspaper without first talking to Cheney.
But by Monday, the White House said Cheney agreed with her suggestion and told her to give the story to a reporter she knew at the Corpus Christi Caller Times.
Q ) Why didn't the local sheriff's office talk to Cheney on the same day as the shooting?
A ) Kenedy County Sheriff Ramon Salinas III and the federal Secret Service have given conflicting accounts.
On Sunday, Salinas told The New York Times that a deputy talked to Cheney Saturday night.
But CBS said the sheriff's office complained a deputy had been turned away that evening.
On Monday, the Secret Service said its agents called Salinas soon after the shooting and arranged for a Sunday morning meeting with Cheney.
Salinas said he decided not to send a deputy Saturday night.
Q ) Why didn't the sheriff charge Cheney in the shooting?
A ) Salinas said he decided it was an accident Saturday after talking to the Secret Service and a ranch hand he described as a former deputy and Salinas' daughter's boyfriend.
Salinas said Cheney and Whittington also told deputies it was accidental.
If Whittington dies, however, the county prosecutor has said he might impanel a grand jury to investigate.
Q ) Whose fault was the shooting?
A ) Cheney Wednesday took full responsibility for the shooting, saying, "You can't blame anybody else.
I'm the guy who pulled the trigger and shot my friend."
But for three days, he let his friend and hunting host, Armstrong, blame the victim, saying it was Whittington's fault for not telling other members of the hunting party he was nearby.
In the end, hunting experts say it's one of the cardinal rules of hunting, that responsibility ultimately lies with the shooter.
"You should know what you're shooting," said one veteran Texas hunting guide.
Harry M. Whittington, the 78 year old hunter accidentally shot by Vice President Dick Cheney, was back in intensive care Tuesday after suffering a mild heart attack, as questions continued to swirl around the White House's handling of the incident.
Doctors treating Whittington said a shotgun pellet that lodged in his chest had triggered what they described as a "silent heart attack."
He was reported in stable condition at the Corpus Christi, Texas, hospital where he has been treated since the shooting on Saturday.
Cheney, who has yet to comment publicly on the shooting, was quoted in a statement from his office as saying that he had spoken with Whittington after learning of his condition and that "his thoughts and prayers are with" the Austin, Texas, attorney.
Doctors who briefed reporters at an afternoon news conference outside Christus Spohn Hospital Corpus Christi Memorial said that Whittington did not experience chest pains or other classic symptoms of a heart attack.
They said the pellet, which they decided to leave in place, had caused inflammation of the heart muscle that caused a temporary blockage of blood flow.
David Blanchard, chief of emergency medicine at the hospital, said doctors were "very, very optimistic" that Whittington would make a full recovery.
Still, the heart attack revealed that Cheney's misfire, first regarded as more embarrassing than life threatening, had potentially put his victim's health in greater danger, after doctors and White House officials initially had described Whittington as on the mend from minor injuries.
It also derailed a concerted White House effort to move past the hunting episode, which has tarnished Cheney's image and highlighted his penchant for secrecy, while thrusting Bush's top aides, including press secretary Scott McClellan, into a tug of war with the media.
Cheney's office under blistering attack for failing to make a public announcement about the shooting reversed course and issued a detailed statement about his concern for Whittington.
It recounted a phone call Cheney made to Whittington after learning of his condition, in which the vice president wished him well "and asked if there was anything he needed," the statement said.
Cheney "said that he stood ready to assist," it added.
Doctors said Whittington was expected to remain at the hospital for a week for treatment and observation.
Doctors in Washington, whom Blanchard described as White House physicians, have been consulting with cardiologists at Christus Spohn on Whittington's care, Blanchard said.
He said they had agreed that it would be in the elderly patient's best interests to treat him with "medical therapy," rather than surgery.
The vice president learned of the change in Whittington's condition Tuesday morning, and watched part of the televised hospital news conference, the statement from his office said.
After that briefing, the release added, Cheney placed a call to Whittington.
Even as the White House struggled for a second straight day to defend its handling of the shooting, McClellan continued to withhold certain details.
He was informed of Whittington's heart troubles before his televised briefing and before the Corpus Christi news conference in which they were disclosed, but he did not mention the developments during the 27 minute exchange, which was dominated by questions about the hunting accident.
"You're welcome to continue to focus on these issues," McClellan told reporters.
"I'm moving on."
McClellan later said he did not reveal the change in Whittington's condition because "it's not appropriate for me to" do so.
"I'm not his doctor, that's for his doctor to talk about."
He also said there were "privacy issues" preventing him from commenting on the matter.
As the focus turned to Whittington's health, new details continued to emerge about what took place on the 50000 acre southeast Texas ranch where the accident occurred.
Katherine Armstrong, a lobbyist whose family owns the ranch, indicated in interviews that she and other members of her family, not Cheney, had decided it was necessary to inform the public about the incident.
After making that decision over breakfast Sunday morning, she and her mother, Anne Armstrong, a former top Republican official, "ran it by" Cheney, Katherine Armstrong told The Dallas Morning News.
She added that Cheney "said something along the lines of, 'You all do whatever you are comfortable with.'
" Katherine Armstrong has lobbied the Bush administration on agriculture issues and lobbied the White House last year on South Korean policy on behalf of South Korean clients, according to federal records.
The sheriff's office in KenedyCounty, where the Armstrong Ranch is located, issued a news release about Saturday's incident saying "there was no alcohol, or misconduct involved," and that "this department is fully satisfied that this was no more than a hunting accident."
Carlos Valdez, the district attorney who prosecutes criminal cases in Kenedy County, said he had yet to speak with the sheriff's officials but is satisfied with what he knows of their investigation.
In Corpus Christi, doctors said they had performed a cardiac catheterization on Whittington, a procedure used to discover whether arteries around the heart are blocked and there has been damage to heart function.
Johns Hopkins University cardiologist Rick Lang said the patient likely had a good prognosis.
This kind of problem usually resolves on its own within one or two weeks, he said.
Doctors were unsure of precisely where the birdshot near Whittington's heart had lodged, Blanchard said.
Mandeep Mehra, chief of cardiology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said the pellet might have ended up in the pericardium, the heart's protective covering.
If so, it could have inflamed this covering, this inflammation can also spread to the heart's chambers.
US Vice President Dick Cheney continued to keep a low profile Wednesday as his shooting of a hunting partner over the weekend and the White House's handling of the incident mushroomed into a political controversy.
Cheney who has yet to express regret publicly for wounding 78 year old Texas lawyer Harry Whittington in the neck, chest and face called him in his hospital room Tuesday to offer help and best wishes, the vice president's office said.
Doctors blamed birdshot that shifted to Whittington's heart for a mild heart attack he suffered Tuesday, and said that while his life was not in immediate danger, and no surgery was needed to remove the lodged metal, he would have to stay in hospital another week.
Whittington has developed an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, which can lead to the formation of blood clots that can cause a stroke if they move to the brain.
Cheney managed to duck a battalion of reporters staking out a meeting he had with lawmakers Tuesday, and White House aides said he had no plans to come forward with his account of the incident.
Amid criticism of the White House for waiting to announce the shooting accident for nearly 21 hours, two former Republican presidential press secretaries said Cheney should have reported the incident to the public without delay.
"It could have and should have been handled differently," Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush's first spokesman from 2001 to 2003, told the magazine Editor and Publisher.
Marlin Fitzwater, who served as press secretary to Bush's father and to late former president Ronald Reagan, told the same publication he was "appalled" at how the administration had handled the incident.
The vice president's office said that his first public event would be on Friday, in Cheyenne, Wyoming but that he was not likely to explain how a quail hunt on the Texas ranch of Katharine Armstrong on Saturday nearly turned tragic.
Cheney's office has refused to provide an official account of the hunting incident, pointing reporters to Armstrong a private citizen with no formal ties to the White House.
President Bush's current chief spokesman, Scott McClellan, served notice that there would be no official, formal White House account of how the incident occurred, even as he signalled impatience with questions about it.
"You all can spend your time on it.
We're going to keep focusing on the pressing priorities of the American people, like talking about how to make health care more affordable and accessible," said the spokesman.
McClellan, who learned of Whittington's heart attack just before his main daily briefing, declined to be drawn by questions about the nearly 21 hour gap between the incident and when it was made public, or why the news came from the ranch owner rather than official channels.
"What happened has been explained," he insisted.
Democratic Senator Hillary Clinton called Cheney's handling of the situation "troubling" and said "a tendency of this administration, from the top all the way to the bottom, is to withhold information."
While Cheney's Republican allies accused the US media of overreacting, the mood grew somber after doctors at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial in Corpus Christi, Texas, reported the heart attack.
Hospital spokesman Peter Banko said Whittington would have to stay in their care for seven more days "to make sure no more birdshot moves into vital organs, as well as that piece of birdshot doesn't move anywhere else in the heart."
Dozens of pieces of birdshot tiny pellets about 5 millimeters in diameter remain lodged in Whittington's body.
Cheney, who visited Whittington in the hospital on Sunday, telephoned him Tuesday afternoon to offer his help and tell him that "his thoughts and prayers are with Mr Whittington and his family," the vice president's office said in a statement.
"Mr Whittington's spirits were good, but obviously his situation deserves the careful monitoring that his doctors are providing," it said.
WASHINGTON An Austin lawyer accidentally shot by Vice President Cheney suffered a minor heart attack Tuesday as a result of birdshot in his heart, complicating a White House effort to steer attention away from the weekend hunting accident.
One of the shotgun pellets that wounded Harry Whittington during a Saturday hunt at a South Texas ranch moved into his heart and caused the attack, said Dr David Blanchard of Christus Spohn Hospital Corpus Christi Memorial, where Whittington is being treated.
Blanchard said Whittington is still expected to fully recover from being peppered with more than 100 birdshot pellets.
At the White House, Press Secretary Scott McClellan, who patiently fielded more than 60 questions about the shooting on Monday, adopted a new tone on Tuesday as reporters pressed for answers.
"We've got important work to do for the American people, and that's where we're going to keep our focus.
You're welcome to continue to focus on these issues.
I'm moving on," said McClellan, who learned about Whittington's heart attack shortly before the noon briefing but made no mention of it.
Whittington's heart problem turned up during a routine evaluation of the 78 year old patient.
The heart attack resulted from an irregular heartbeat triggered by a single piece of birdshot that had moved into his heart.
Blanchard said Whittington had no other symptoms or pain.
"When birdshot is in your body there is always a risk it can move," he said.
"His arteries are clear and he has the heart of a much younger individual."
Doctors did a cardiac catheterization and moved Whittington back into intensive care.
The procedure allows doctors to insert dye into the heart to map the blood supply and monitor for blockage.
Blanchard said the birdshot is lodged in position and does not pose additional danger.
"It was just a terrible, terrible accident," Peggy Puckett, one of Whittington's four daughters, said Tuesday.
"No one was at fault.
He feels bad for the vice president."
Asked if Whittington agreed with eyewitness accounts that said he was at fault for approaching Cheney while he was shooting, Puckett said her father "hasn't said anything like that."
At the White House, Cheney's office issued a statement on behalf of the vice president, who has yet to make a public comment about the shooting.
In it, Cheney aides said he was told Tuesday morning about Whittington's cardiac problem.
Cheney watched part of the Corpus Christi news conference concerning Whittington's condition.
He then called Whittington and "wished (him) well and asked if there was anything he needed."
"The vice president said that he stood ready to assist," the statement said.
"Mr Whittington's spirits were good, but obviously his situation deserves the careful monitoring that his doctors are providing.
The vice president said that his thoughts and prayers are with Mr Whittington and his family."
(Story can end here, Optional add follows) McClellan's effort to divert attention from the shooting persisted throughout the Tuesday briefing.
"We're moving on to the priorities of the American people.
That's where our focus is," McClellan said.
Those priorities, he added, include "talking about how to make health care more affordable and accessible," a topic Bush is to address Wednesday in Dublin, Ohio.
McClellan fielded several more questions about the shooting, but added no new information including no mention of the heart attack and referred questions to Cheney's office.
One of the questions referred to a shooting related joke McClellan had told at an earlier briefing on Tuesday.
Before he was aware of Whittington's updated condition, he made a humorous reference to the fact that University of Texas football fans at the White House for an event honoring UT's national champion football team would be clad in school colors.
"The orange they're wearing is not because they are concerned that the vice president may be there," McClellan said, a reference to the high visibility orange worn by hunters as a safety precaution.
By the noon briefing, aware of Whittington's heart attack, McClellan had a dour answer to a question about whether "there is a certain degree of relief that Mr Whittington seems to be fine."
"Well, I think Mr Whittington remains in our thoughts and prayers," McClellan said.
"We all want to make sure that he's OK and that he gets home and he recovers fully, and that's where our focus is and that's where it will continue to be."

Vice President Dick Cheney said in a broadcast interview Wednesday that he accepts full blame for mistakenly shooting a hunting partner last weekend, abandoning his tight lipped stance on an accident that has drawn sharp criticism and proved damaging to the Bush administration.
In his first public comments on the incident, Cheney called the day of the shooting "one of the worst days of my life," appearing somber and shaken as he described having shot Harry M. Whittington, a 78 year old Austin, Texas, lawyer last Saturday afternoon.
But Cheney was unrepentant during the 27 minute interview with Brit Hume of Fox News Channel about his decision not to tell the news media about the accident until the next day.
Cheney acknowledged waiting until after he knew "that Harry was probably going to be OK" before allowing it to be disclosed.
At that point, Cheney said, leaving it to the owner of the Texas ranch where the shooting occurred to contact one local reporter "was the right call."
The vice president's decision to discuss the incident came after three days of intense criticism and was an unusual move for Cheney, who rarely grants interviews and then largely to conservative TV and radio commentators whose audience regards him as a hero.
In this case, said Jennifer Mayfield, a spokeswoman, Cheney "just wanted to talk to the American people, and we thought an interview would be the best way to do so."
Cheney used the opportunity to show a more human side to an accident that has made him the butt of jokes and scathing criticism, and become a liability for a White House struggling to improve its image in an election year.
Since Sunday, the incident has distracted attention from President Bush's activities, such as his visit Wednesday to Ohio to promote his health care proposals.
It has also served to underscore criticism of Cheney and the administration as secretive and raised new questions about their credibility.
Cheney said he is still haunted by the shooting.
"The image of him falling is something I'll never ever be able to get out of my mind.
I fired, and there's Harry falling.
It was, I'd have to say, one of the worst days of my life at that moment," said Cheney, who was interviewed in his ceremonial office in the old Executive Office Building next door to the White House.
The vice president broke with allies who had suggested that Whittington was at fault for wandering unannounced into Cheney's line of fire.
"I'm the guy who pulled the trigger that fired the round that hit Harry.
You can talk about all of the other conditions that exist at the time but that's the bottom line, and it was not Harry's fault," Cheney said.
"You can't blame anybody else.
I'm the guy who pulled the trigger and shot my friend."
Whittington was in stable condition at a hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas, officials there said.
He is under observation after one of the pellets Cheney shot Saturday moved to his heart, causing inflammation and restricting blood flow in what doctors described as a minor heart attack early Tuesday.
Cheney's hastily scheduled interview was a change in course by the vice president, whose office shared few details about the accident.
It came as prominent Republicans and public relations specialists were criticizing the White House for its handling of the story.
Marlin Fitzwater, who served as White House press secretary for Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush, faulted Cheney for the approach in an interview with Editor & Publisher, saying he "ignored his responsibility to the American people."
Fitzwater told the magazine's Web site that he was "appalled by the whole handling of this."
Cheney defended his decision to stay silent about the accident until the next day, acknowledging that senior White House aides had "urged us to get the story out."
He argued that, for the sake of accuracy, he wanted to wait until Whittington's condition was clear before contacting reporters.
(Begin optional trim) Trevor Parry Giles, a political communication specialist at the University of Maryland, said in choosing to speak to Fox, a network seen as more sympathetic to the administration than other news outlets, Cheney had chosen "a perfect venue" for him.
But Parry Giles added that the interview "will only fuel the suspicions that people already have about him, that he is unwilling to open himself to criticism."
"I don't know that it will help him in terms of the public perception," Parry Giles said.
(End optional trim) Democrats and liberal groups criticized Cheney for limiting his remarks on the matter to one session with a network they called biased in his favor.
Sen Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, noted that Cheney has not had a news conference to field questions from reporters in three and a half years.
"He ought to have one to clear the air not only on this issue, but more importantly on the many other issues that have been shrouded by a veil of secrecy," Schumer said in a statement.
Republicans rallied to Cheney's defense.
"The constant second guessing of what the vice president should have said and when he should have said it is an unnecessary diversion from the many issues facing our nation," said Sen Lindsey O. Graham, R S.C.
Asked whether he would go hunting again in the future, Cheney, an avid outdoorsman, said, "I'll have to think about it."
"The season is ending," he added.
"I'm going to let some time pass over it and think about the future."
Democrats in Congress on Tuesday accused Vice President Dick Cheney of a pattern of secrecy, and demanded that he "level" with the public, after keeping mum about accidentally shooting an associate over the weekend.
Cheney has been criticized for waiting a day before disclosing a hunting mishap Saturday in which he shot his 78 year old hunting companion, Harry Whittington, in the neck, chest, and face.
Asked at a press conference for her reaction about how the White House has handled the incident, US Senator Hillary Clinton called the Bush administration's failure to be more forthcoming "troubling."
"A tendency of this administration from the top all the way to the bottom is to withhold information ,to refuse to be forthcoming about information that is of significance and relevance to the jobs that all of you do, and the interests of the American people," Clinton said.
"Putting it all together, going back years now, there's a pattern and it's a pattern that should be troubling," she said at a press conference calling for a more robust federal response to the Hurricane Katrina disaster.
The former first lady continued: "The refusal of this administration to level with the American people on matters large and small is very disturbing, because it goes counter to the way our constitutional democracy ,is supposed to work."
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid at a press conference Tuesday said the secretive tendency goes beyond Cheney, pervading the entire Bush the White House.
"I think the reason it took the vice president a day to talk about this is part of the secretive nature of this administration," the top Senate Democrat said.
"They keep things pretty close to the chest."
"I think it's time the American people heard from the vice president, in a real meeting just like we're having here," said Reid, who called the George W. Bush presidency "the most secretive administration in modern history."
"In the last many, many decades, there's no administration more secretive than this," he said.
Cheney has not commented publicly about the accident, which took place on the 50000 acre Armstrong Ranch in Texas on Saturday, although he issued a statement Tuesday saying that his "thoughts and prayers" were with his friend, and that he stood ready to help Whittington in any way.
"The vice president said that his thoughts and prayers are with Mr Whittington and his family," the statement said.
Allegations that he is obsessively secretive have dogged Cheney since the early days of the Bush presidency, including his refusal during the administration's first term to reveal the participants on energy task force he led.
The vice president also has been criticized for a possible role in helping craft the administration's controversial secret domestic wiretapping policy.
Meanwhile, his chief of staff, Scooter Libby, has been implicated in secretly leaking the name of a CIA officer to discredit her husband an action some recent news accounts suggest may have been sanctioned by Cheney.
Senator Chuck Schumer said Tuesday the time has come for the vice president to hold a press conference which Schumer said would be Cheney's first in some four years to clear the air.
"In light of the recent shooting accident and all the questions surrounding his role in the leaking of classified national security information through his Chief of Staff Lewis Libby, there are many questions that Americans have for VP Cheney," Schumer said in a press release.
The 78 year old lawyer shot by Vice President Dick Cheney in a hunting accident over the weekend suffered a minor heart attack early Tuesday from birdshot lodged in his heart, hospital officials in Texas said.
The lawyer, Harry Whittington, was moved back into the intensive care unit at Christus Spohn Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas, to be monitored for up to a week in case the birdshot shifted or additional pellets in his body moved into other organs, the officials said at a televised news conference.
Dr David Blanchard, the emergency room chief, estimated that Whittington had more than five but "probably less than 150 to 200" pellets lodged in his body.
Blanchard said that the hospital's cardiologists were optimistic that the pellet in Whittington's heart would not travel farther and that he would be able to function normally.
They said they did not consider the other pellets in his body problematic.
Cheney's office, in its first official announcement about the incident, released a statement shortly after 2:30 p.m. Eastern time saying that the vice president's "thoughts and prayers are with Mr Whittington and his family" and that Cheney had spoken by telephone to Whittington an hour earlier.
"The vice president wished Mr Whittington well and asked if there was anything he needed," the statement said.
"The vice president said that he stood ready to assist."
The statement added that Whittington's spirits were "good," but "obviously his situation deserves the careful monitoring that his doctors are providing."
The downturn in Whittington's health significantly changed the tone of the White House reaction to the hunting accident.
In Texas, Carlos Valdez, the district attorney in Kleberg County, said a fatality would immediately spur a new report from the local sheriff and, most likely, a grand jury investigation.
Cheney's aides said he first learned of the change in Whittington's condition when he arrived at his West Wing office about 7:40 a.m. on Tuesday, shortly after doctors in Corpus Christi said that they had picked up an irregular heartbeat from Whittington during their morning rounds.
Doctors said that the pellet, which they had known since the accident was near Whittington's heart, had evidently moved into the heart muscle, causing "some quivering" called atrial fibrillation.
Whittington, who had been shot by Cheney on Saturday and moved out of intensive care on Monday, was immediately put back into intensive care.
The account given Tuesday by doctors caring for the Texas lawyer accidentally shot by Vice President Dick Cheney last weekend raises serious questions about how and when a pellet entered his heart and what tests were done to establish where the pellet was lodged, doctors not connected with his case said.
Although the public was told for the first time on Tuesday that a shotgun pellet from a hunting accident had lodged in the lawyer's heart, one of his doctors said that "we knew that he had some birdshot very close to the heart from the get go," but not its precise location.
Such evidence would have come from standard chest X rays and a CT scan if one was performed shortly after his admission to a hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas.
Earlier accounts described as minor the pellet wounds that the lawyer, Harry M. Whittington, suffered in the face, neck, chest and ribs.
Cheney sprayed Whittington, 78, with six to 200 pieces of birdshot, the doctors said Tuesday.
One pellet apparently moved to damage his heart, causing two problems: an abnormal heart rhythm, atrial fibrillation, and a minor heart attack that were detected early Tuesday morning, the doctors said in a news conference at Christus Spohn Hospital in Corpus Christi.
Their account left open the source of the birdshot that migrated to the heart and how it got there.
Dr O. Wayne Isom, the chairman of heart and chest surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College, said it was unlikely that a pellet would migrate to the heart through the bloodstream, as some have assumed from the account of the Texas doctors.
The reason, Isom said, is that the pellet would have to enter a vein, travel to and through the lung vessels that go to the heart, and then lodge in heart tissue, not in one of its chambers.
The pellets were approximately 5 millimeters, about the size of a BB, and larger than most blood vessels, said Dr David Blanchard, director of emergency services at the hospital.
A more likely explanation, Isom said, is that the pellet lodged in or touched the heart when Whittington was shot.
Doctors use different X ray techniques to determine the position of a pellet in the heart.
But the account of the Texas doctors was unclear regarding which ones they performed and when.
Dr Peter Banko, the Texas hospital's emergency department medical director, said doctors there did an ultrasound, a CT scan and a cardiac catheterization, which provide two dimensional images.
Banko said the hospital had a 64 slice CT scan that could provide three dimensional images, but he did not say that the doctors performed the more sophisticated one on Whittington, or if so, when.
Doctors try to synchronize such CT X rays with the heartbeat to avoid blurring from motion, said Dr Jeffrey P. Goldman, a specialist in heart CT scans at Manhattan Diagnostic Radiology.
But, Goldman said, doctors cannot synchronize a CT scan in patients with atrial fibrillation.
Metal in a pellet can cause a different kind of blurring in CT scans.
But the Texas doctors did not say that they performed a 64 slice CT scan after they learned Whittington had a pellet near his heart and before he developed the abnormal heart rhythm.
Goldman said that "until you do the test you don't know how much blurring there is."
Isom said patients could develop atrial fibrillation two to three days after stitches were placed in a heart or it was injured.
The Texas doctors did not say how they determined that Whittington had had a heart attack.
Two standard tests are from electrocardiograms and measuring enzymes.
But injuries to the heart can cause a rise in enzymes that may not necessarily represent a heart attack.
The Texas doctors and the White House doctors with whom they discussed Whittington's case did not respond to a request for interviews.
When the White House press secretary, Scott McClellan, entered the press room Tuesday morning and suggested he was wearing an orange tie to avoid a stray shot from Vice President Dick Cheney, it seemed to signal an effort to defuse the accidental shooting story with a laugh.
But by midday, it was clear that the staffs of the president and the vice president had failed to communicate.
Just after arriving at work around 7:45 a.m., Cheney learned that the man he shot, Harry Whittington, was about to undergo a heart procedure because his injuries were more serious than earlier believed, Cheney's spokeswoman said.
No one in Cheney's office passed the word to McClellan, senior officials at the White House said, adding that the press secretary never would have joked about the shooting accident if he had known about the turn of events involving Whittington.
It was the latest example of the degree to which Cheney's habit of living in his own world in the Bush White House surrounded by his own staff, relying on his own instincts, saying as little as possible had backfired since the accident in Texas on Saturday.
Cheney's staff members have kept their comments to chronological details and to repeating Cheney's written statements.
The tension between President Bush's staff and Cheney's has been palpable, with White House officials whispering to reporters about how they tried to handle the news of the shooting differently.
McClellan, while being careful not to cross Cheney or his aides directly, has made a point of reminding reporters of how he dealt with Bush's bicycle accident last summer, when the president collided with a policeman at the G 8 summit.
"I immediately briefed the press on how the accident had happened, and the condition of the police officer," who was taken to the hospital with minor injuries, McClellan said.
His message was clear: There was a procedure for conveying this kind of news, and it was not followed in this case.
Several White House officials said no one among the White House staff, including the chief of staff, Andrew H. Card, felt empowered to dictate how news of the shooting accident would be handled.
Presumably the Bush himself could have declared how the news would be disseminated, something he does often on policy matters.
Until this week, the periodic disconnect between Cheney's office and the rest of the White House has been the source of grumbling, but rarely open tension.
A Texas sheriff's office has cleared U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney of any wrongdoing in a shooting accident at a ranch in the state Saturday, the USA Today newspaper reported Tuesday.
Cheney accidentally shot fellow hunter Harry Whittington while they were hunting quail at the Armstrong Ranch, in southern Texas.
The Kenedy County Sheriff's Office near the ranch interviewed both men after the Secret Service called to notify them shortly after the shooting, the report said.
The sheriff's office said investigation revealed that there was no alcohol or misconduct involved in the incident, which "was no more than a hunting accident."
Cheney did violate one small legal requirement, the report said.
Cheney's office said Monday that while Cheney had a 125 U.S. dollar non resident Texas hunting license, he lacked a required 7 dollar stamp to hunt upland game birds such as quail.
In a statement, his office said Cheney has mailed a 7 dollar check for the stamp.
The White House worked on Monday to explain why it took almost 20 hours for the public to first learn of the accident.
"The first priority was making sure that Harry Whittington, Mr Whittington, was getting the medical care that he needed," White House spokesman Scott McClellan said.
President George W. Bush and White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove were told of the shooting Saturday night but deferred to Cheney on providing information to the public, a report in Tuesday's The Washington Post said.
The Post report said even some White House officials thought Cheney mishandled the responses and opened the administration to criticism that it was withholding important public information.
Whittington, 78, an Austin lawyer and longtime Republican activist, was in stable condition at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial in Corpus Christi, Texas, news reports said.
Cardinals from around the globe began their secret conclave to elect a new pope Monday and later cast their first ballots, failing to reach agreement on a successor to Pope John Paul II.
Shortly after 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. EDT), black smoke emerged from a metal chimney atop the tile roof of the Sistine Chapel the traditional signal that the cardinals have voted but that no new pope has been elected.
The smoke momentarily appeared white the sign that a pope has been chosen and a crowd in St. Peter's Square burst into applause.
The smoke then turned unmistakably black, indicating that, as expected, more than one ballot would be needed before the conclave finished its work.
The first vote came more than two hours after the cardinals had locked themselves inside the Sistine Chapel following a solemn oath taking in which they pledged to maintain the conclave's traditional secrecy.
Earlier, the putative front runner to succeed John Paul, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, inveighed against ideological fashions and urged his fellow cardinals to hold fast to church doctrine.

Cardinals from around the globe began their secret conclave to elect a new pope Monday, filing into the Sistine Chapel in a solemn procession hours after the putative front runner to succeed Pope John Paul II, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, inveighed against ideological fashions and urged his fellow cardinals to hold fast to church doctrine.
Wearing crimson robes and caps, the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church swore collective and individual oaths of secrecy before taking their places to begin the conclave in the chapel beneath the renowned frescoes of Michelangelo.
As they entered the chapel, they filed past the Vatican's Swiss Guards in ceremonial uniforms.
Led by Ratzinger, the cardinals pledged "secrecy regarding everything that in any way relates to the election of the Roman Pontiff and regarding what occurs in the place of the election," They swore "not to break this secret in any way, either during or after the election of the new Pontiff, unless explicit authorization is granted by the same Pontiff," and they promised to resist any intervention by "secular authorities" or anyone else in the election of the pope.
After the oath taking, television camera operators who were recording the scene live and all others were ordered out of the chapel, and its wooden doors were closed.
Hours before the conclave, Ratzinger delivered a blunt sermon at St. Peter's Basilica.
His homily at the traditional Mass for the election of a pope amounted to a campaign speech for orthodoxy, continuity with John Paul's papacy and staunch resistance to cultural pressure for change in the 1.1 billion member Roman Catholic Church.
The German cardinal, who turned 78 on Saturday, described the church as a "little boat of Christian thought" buffeted by waves of Marxism, liberalism, libertinism, collectivism, radical individualism, atheism, agnosticism and syncretism.
"How many winds of doctrine have we known?" he asked.
"How many ideological currents, how many fashions of thought?"
"To have a clear faith according to the church's creed is often labeled fundamentalism, while relativism letting ourselves be carried away by any wind of doctrine is made to appear the only attitude acceptable in today's times," he said.
"A dictatorship of relativism is established that recognizes nothing as definitive and that leaves as the final standard only one's own ego and desires."
Italian newspapers, without naming any sources in the College of Cardinals, have speculated that Ratzinger will enter the conclave Monday afternoon with about 50 votes.
A total of 117 cardinals under age 80 are eligible to vote, but two are ill, bringing the expected number of electors to 115.
Two thirds, or 77 votes, are needed for election in the early rounds of voting.
"I thought it was Ratzinger saying, in effect, what you see is what you get," the Rev. Richard John Neuhaus, editor of the journal First Things, said of the German cardinal's homily.
"It was vintage Ratzinger calm, deliberate, precise, incisive."
The cardinals in red robes and white miters formed a crescent in front of the altar, which rests atop the tomb of St. Peter and under a huge bronze canopy, or baldachin.
"Obviously they're all sitting there thinking, what would this man be like as pope?"
Neuhaus said.
The cardinal described by some as the most likely alternative to Ratzinger in the initial voting is Carlo Maria Martini, also 78, the retired archbishop of Milan.
If neither can reach the two thirds threshold, the field could open to numerous possible candidates.
Among the most frequently mentioned are Cardinals Dionigi Tettamanzi of Milan, Angelo Scola of Venice, Camillo Ruini of Rome, Francis Arinze of Nigeria, Ivan Dias of India, Christoph Schoenborn of Austria, Claudio Hummes of Brazil, Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina and Oscar Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga of Honduras.
The cardinals arrived by foot and by car Sunday at the Domus Sanctae Marthae, the Vatican guesthouse where they will sleep and eat during the conclave.
All were dressed in their traditional red trimmed black cassocks, their waists wrapped in scarlet sashes and their heads bobbing beneath scarlet skullcaps.
Already forbidden to speak to reporters, they were to take a vow of complete secrecy upon entering the Sistine Chapel on Monday.
There, under Michelangelo's depiction of a stern Christ delivering the Last Judgment, they will mark their ballots at long tables covered with golden cloths.
Most conclaves in the past century have lasted only three or four days.
But if the cardinals remain deadlocked for more than 12 days, they can change the rules and elect the pontiff by a simple majority an innovation introduced by John Paul that has never been tried before.
The ballots are burned in an old stove, and when someone wins, a chemical will be added to turn the smoke white.
On Sunday, some of the cardinals celebrated Mass at churches they are nominally assigned to in Rome.
None was tipping his hand.
During a sermon at the church of San Giovanni della Pigna, Arinze told the congregation that the next pope "should be a preacher" and "a shepherd who sacrifices himself for the people of God."
At the church of San Andrea delle Fratte, Cardinal Ennio Antonelli, the archbishop of Florence, said: "The new pope has already been chosen by the Lord.
We just have to pray to understand who he is."
VATICAN CITY On the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, where the next pope will be introduced to the world, a red curtain now hangs open, as if waiting for a cardinal to arrive and pronounce the news in Latin: "Habemus Papam."
Tourists and journalists Sunday trained their eyes and their cameras on the T shaped chimney above the Sistine Chapel, where, sooner or later, white smoke will signal the election of a pope.
And the 115 cardinal electors those under age 80 Sunday left apartments and hotels and seminaries around Rome and moved into the Domus Sanctae Marthae, the $20 million residence where they will stay while participating in the conclave that begins Monday.
The cardinals, who stopped granting on the record interviews more than a week ago, have offered few indications as to whom they will choose to replace John Paul II, who died April 2 after a 26 year papacy.
Representing 52 countries, the most diverse group in history, the cardinals say they believe the choice will be informed by the Holy Spirit.
They plan to gather at 10 a.m. (4 a.m. EDT) Monday in St. Peter's Basilica for a "Mass for the election of the Supreme Pontiff."
Then, at 4:30 p.m. (10:30 a.m. EDT), the cardinals are scheduled to gather in the Vatican palace and process into the Sistine Chapel, where they are to swear an oath, pledging secrecy, and to hear a meditation delivered by a retired cardinal, Tomas Spidlik.
And then, the election begins.
The cardinals will choose whether or not to cast a first ballot Monday afternoon, after Monday, they are scheduled to vote twice each morning and twice each afternoon until they elect a pope.
Many Vatican watchers believe there is no cardinal who currently enjoys the support of 77 cardinals, the two thirds' majority traditionally required for the election of a pope.
But attention in Vatican City is focused on one cardinal who is sure to influence the selection, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of Germany, as well as about two dozen others who are considered "papabile," or qualified to become the 265th leader of the Catholic Church, which has 1 billion members.
"This is a hard decision and a very heavy decision," said Sister Mary Ann Walsh, a spokeswoman for the US Conference of Catholic Bishops.
"They have to make the choice based on the needs of the church and the needs of the wider society."
Ratzinger and several Italian cardinals are among the potential kingmakers at the conclave, viewed by many analysts as able to influence the selection of the next pope, even if they themselves are not likely to be elected.
Among them are Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the former archbishop of Milan, who is highly regarded by moderates but is considered unlikely to become pope because he is 78 and has Parkinson's disease, and Cardinal Camillo Ruini, the vicar general for Rome and the longtime president of the Italian bishops' conference.
Several Italian cardinals are also among the most discussed candidates for the papacy.
Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi of Milan has emerged as a favorite of moderates, despite his ties to the conservative group Opus Dei, because of his interest in social justice, while Cardinal Angelo Scola of Venice, the son of a truck driver who became an accomplished theologian, is liked by conservatives.
But many Vatican watchers are focused on the possibility of a Latin American pope, because about half of the world's Catholics live in that region.
Cardinal Claudio Hummes of Sao Paolo demonstrated his concern for labor by offering shelter to striking metalworkers, Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires is a Jesuit priest who prefers to travel by bus and refused to live in the local archbishop's mansion, and Cardinal Oscar Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga of Tegucigalpa, Honduras, is an advocate for the poor who drew critical attention when he blasted US newspapers, including The Boston Globe, for their coverage of the clergy sexual abuse crisis.
He called the coverage "a persecution of the church" and said it was characterized by "a fury which reminds me of the times of Diocletian and Nero and, more recently, Stalin and Hitler."
Among the long shot possibilities are Cardinal Ivan Dias of Bombay, a longtime Vatican diplomat, Cardinal Marc Ouellet of Quebec, a crusader against same sex marriage in Canada, and Cardinal Ennio Antonelli, the archbishop of Florence, who Sunday said in a homily: "The new pope has already been chosen by the Lord.
We just have to pray to understand who he is."
Ratzinger, who was the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith during the John Paul II papacy, is admired by many for his defense of orthodoxy, but is also controversial for approving the disciplining of numerous theologians.
Ratzinger recently approved a teaching ban against the Rev. Roger Haight, formerly of the Weston Jesuit School of Theology in Cambridge, because Ratzinger deemed a book Haight wrote as containing "serious doctrinal errors" about the role of Jesus in the salvation for non Christians.
Ratzinger has enjoyed a boomlet in support in part because many people thought he did a good job delivering the homily at John Paul II's funeral, and in part because he was a close adviser to the pontiff.
"His performance at the funeral certainly solidified his reputation, and if he's not elected himself, I don't think anyone can be elected over his objections," said John Peter Pham, a professor at James Madison University.
But Ratzinger turned 78 Saturday, which Vatican analysts say could be a concern because, even though Ratzinger appears healthy, the cardinals might want to avoid the prospect of another frail, ailing pope in the short term.
"I think it's going to be a fairly challenging conclave there's never been a leading candidate, and the reason is that there are a whole number of opinions, and so much depends on what the cardinals find to be the major issue facing the church," said the Rev. Keith Pecklers, professor of theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.
Sunday, crowds of tourists milled about a rainy St. Peter's Square, visiting the basilica, taking pictures of the chimney, and talking expectantly about the week ahead.
"I would like them to choose someone who will continue where the old man has left off not to favor any continent, but to be a universal person," said Stan Alfwani, a 34 year old seminarian from Nairobi.
Alfwani said he hopes the next pope will pay particular attention to "inculturation," making sure that the church is assimilated into different cultures, including those of Africa.
Yasuhiko Masuoka, 67, of Tokyo said he, too, is hoping for a pope who will carry on John Paul II's policies.
But Masuoka also said he would like the cardinals to make another bold geographic choice, as they did with John Paul II, who, as a Pole, was the first non Italian pope in 455 years.
"This time they should choose a pope from Latin America, because it will show a more cosmopolitan image to the world," Masuoka said.
Even non Catholic visitors said they are paying close attention to the goings on.
"John Paul II was very good for all religions, and we hope that whoever will replace him will do the same," said Mohammed Salem, 49, of Mauritania, a Muslim tourist who praised John Paul II's outreach to Islam.

Cardinals from six continents made their solemn procession to the Sistine Chapel on Monday to convene the new millennium's first conclave a secret and sacred gathering to elect a pope who will guide the world's 1.1 billion Roman Catholics into a new era.
Clad in crimson vestments and caps, the 115 voting "princes" of a church stung by priest sex abuse scandals and an exodus of the faithful walked slowly from the Apostolic Palace to sequester themselves inside the chapel decorated with frescoes by Michelangelo.
They were to take an oath of secrecy and hear a meditation before deciding whether to take their first vote or wait until Tuesday.
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger a powerful Vatican official from Germany who often has been mentioned as a leading candidate for pope recited a prayer at the palace before the cardinals chanted the Litany of the Saints as they made the short walk to the chapel.
The cardinals were led by altar servers carrying two long, lit white candles and a metal crucifix.
Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church convene in the Sistine Chapel this afternoon for a session that could produce the first ballot for a successor to Pope John Paul II, although such swift resolution seems unlikely.
The last conclave in 1978 took eight ballots over three days to choose John Paul.
And the cardinals have much to ponder after the third longest papacy in history.
This conclave feels the full weight of the church's modern challenges, including the influence of Islam, competition from evangelical Christians, the fallout from priest sex scandals, the roles of women and the need to reconcile Vatican teachings that ban condom use with worries about AIDS.
The cardinals also must seek a global pastor with enough charisma to flourish in an image driven age.
For the first time, credible papal contenders come from at least three distinct regions: Europe, Africa and Latin America.
On a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon, the red robed princes of the church made their way into the Vatican compound where they will stay until they elect a new pope.
Some drove themselves, others were chauffeured.
A Mass at 10 a.m. today will be their last official public appearance until they have a new leader.
The cardinals drew lots last week for rooms in the $20 million "Domus Sanctae Marthae" (St. Martha's House), a hotel built by John Paul II and operated by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent DePaul.
From there, they will go to the Sistine Chapel twice daily unless the first ballot provides a two thirds majority for a candidate.
For the first time ever, cardinals will be allowed to move about Vatican City freely once the voting starts, though they are forbidden to talk to anyone who hasn't been sworn to secrecy.
The penalty is severe excommunication.
According to rules put in place by John Paul II in 1996, the 115 cardinals eligible to vote may have one ballot on the first day of the conclave, as the sequestered gatherings are known.
Cardinals traditionally have used their first vote to honor mentors and admired leaders, according to John Allen, author of "Conclave," a book about the process of electing a pope.
The elaborately detailed rules for election of a supreme pontiff for the 1.1 billion member church are based on rituals going back centuries.
"Behind every single word in the constitution for election of a pope, you'll find historical reasons we do it that way," said Charles Burns, retired Vatican archivist.
On Saturday, Vatican officials allowed a pool of reporters to enter the Sistine Chapel, now set up for the election.
Cardinals will sit in plain wooden chairs at six long tables in a room decorated with some of the world's most famous artwork including Michelangelo's ceiling.
The "scrutineers," three randomly selected cardinals who will count the votes, face Michelangelo's monumental "Last Judgment."
For the next few days, the world's attention will be focused on the chapel roof, watching for the white smoke that indicates a successful election.
This year, bells also will ring when a pope is elected.
Black smoke from burning ballots with wet straw will appear once each morning and afternoon if no one is selected.
If no cardinal wins a two thirds majority, 77 votes, after the third day, the cardinals will pause for a day for prayer and discussion, as John Paul ordered.
Voting resumes for seven ballots, followed by another pause, then seven more and another pause, then seven more.
If there is still no pope, John Paul said, the cardinals may resort to a simple majority, or 58.
Such a turn would come around May 1.
If the conclaves of the last century are any guide, a pope should be elected by the end of the week.
The longest conclave took 14 ballots, lasted five days and produced Pope Pius XI in 1922.
The shortest a day elected Pius XII in 1939 (three ballots) and John Paul I in 1978 (three or four ballots).
The idea of a conclave, which literally means "with key," was started by church people as a means of inconveniencing the cardinals to make them speed up the process.
Today it also provides a means of preserving secrecy in an age of new technology.
John Paul II's 1996 rules require that two "trustworthy technicians" make sure that no audiovisual equipment is installed.
Cardinals are prohibited from written correspondence or telephone conversations with anyone besides one another and workers who have taken an oath of secrecy.
They also are forbidden from watching television, listening to radio or reading newspapers and magazines.
The cardinals have been under a self imposed ban on interviews with the news media, but Italian newspapers have regularly reported how possible papal candidates are faring, what factions are forming and even, from the Turin newspaper "La Stampa," what the cardinals were packing in their suitcases.
(Some packed CDs and earphones, others put in snacks, according to the report.)
Speculation continues to focus on German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger who, as dean of the college of cardinals, will lead today's Mass.
But at least a dozen other names are regularly mentioned.
Ratzinger, a respected theologian known as a polarizing church figure while head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, is 78.
Cardinals could select him as a "caretaker pope" who would presumably serve a shorter reign than the 26 years John Paul served.
Other presumed front runners include a slew of Italian cardinals, including Dionigi Tettamanzi, Angelo Sodano and Carlo Martini, Latin Americans Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina, Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga of Honduras and Claudio Hummes of Brazil, a Nigerian, Francis Arinze, and an Indian, Ivan Dias.
Yet papal elections have been famously unpredictable, with unexpected winners and presumed front runners often facing surprising fates.
Indeed, John Paul II was a surprise choice to many when he was elected in 1978.
He was the first non Italian pope in 455 years, and many analysts say the Italians are desperate to reclaim the papacy.
Italy has the biggest national group, but the bloc of 20 cardinals is not big enough for them to pick a pope on their own.
Latin America has 20 voting cardinals and nearly half the church's followers.
Some analysts believe that to recognize the importance of its Latin American flock, the church will need to name the first pope from the other side of the Atlantic.

In a historic gathering steeped in intrigue, cardinals from six continents on Monday open their first conclave of the new millennium to elect a pope who will inherit John Paul II's mantle and guide the world's 1.1 billion Roman Catholics into a new era.
Representing 52 countries, the 115 crimson robed "princes" of a church stung by priest sex abuse scandals and an exodus of the faithful were to celebrate a midmorning Mass at St. Peter's Basilica before sequestering themselves in the Sistine Chapel at 4:30 p.m. (1430 GMT).
There, seated atop a false floor hiding electronic jamming devices designed to thwart eavesdroppers, they were to take an oath of secrecy, hear a meditation from a senior cardinal and decide whether to take a first vote or wait until Tuesday.
"The new pope has already been chosen by the Lord.
We just have to pray to understand who he is," Florence Cardinal Ennio Antonelli, considered by some to be a dark horse candidate, told believers who gathered for Sunday Mass at his titular church in Rome.
Thousands of pilgrims and tourists were expected to converge on St. Peter's Square to watch the chapel chimney for the white smoke that ultimately will tell the world that the church's 265th pontiff has been elected.
The famous stove in the chapel also will bellow black smoke to signal any inconclusive round of voting.
Although the conclave could last for days, a pope could be chosen as early as Monday afternoon if the red capped prelates opt to begin casting ballots after their solemn procession from the Vatican's Apostolic Palace to the chapel.
If they decide to hold off a day, they will hold four rounds of voting two in the morning, two in the afternoon on Tuesday and every day until a candidate gets two thirds support: 77 votes.
If they remain deadlocked late in the second week of voting, they can vote to change the rules so a winner can be elected with a simple majority: 58 votes.
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls said smoke from burned ballot papers enhanced by special chemicals likely could be seen at around noon (1000 GMT) and around 7 p.m. (1700 GMT) on each day of voting by the cardinal electors, all of whom are under age 80.
At some point soon after the new pope is chosen, the Vatican also will ring bells.
On Sunday, the cardinals moved into the super secure Domus Sanctae Marthae, a euro26 million (US$20 million) hotel that John Paul had constructed inside Vatican City so they could rest in comfort in private rooms between voting sessions.
Swiss Guards, their gaily colored uniforms covered by dark rain gear, saluted the prelates as they were whisked to the residence in limousines.
The daily La Stampa said cardinals gearing up for a stressful stretch of days had packed CD players and headphones in their bags along with prayer books and snacks to nibble on in their rooms.
Conspicuously missing from their quarters were cell phones, newspapers, radios, TVs and Internet connections all banned in new rules laid down by John Paul II to minimize the chances of news influencing their secret deliberations and to prevent leaks to the outside world.
The Vatican's security squad swept the chapel for listening devices, and cooks, maids, elevator operators and drivers were sworn to secrecy, with excommunication the punishment for any indiscretions.
No conclave in the past century has lasted more than five days, and the election that made John Paul II pope in October 1978 took eight ballots over three days.
He died April 2 at 84 after a pontificate that lasted more than 26 years, history's third longest papacy.
Cardinals faced a choice that boiled down to two options: an older, skilled administrator who could serve as a "transitional" pope while the church absorbs John Paul's legacy, or a younger dynamic pastor and communicator perhaps from Latin America or elsewhere in the developing world where the church is growing who could build on the late pontiff's popularity over a quarter century of globe trotting.
The prelates agreed after John Paul's funeral not to talk publicly about the process, but the world's news media have been rife with speculation centering on about two dozen candidates considered "papabile," Italian for pope material.
The name with the biggest buzz was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, a powerful Vatican official from Germany who was to recite an opening prayer in Latin that the voters be guided "in our hearts in love and in patience."
Among the issues sure to figure prominently in the conclave: containing the priest sex abuse scandals that have cost the church millions in settlements in the United States, coping with a chronic shortage of priests and nuns in the West, halting the stream of people leaving a church whose teachings they no longer find relevant, and improving dialogue with the Islamic world.
Cardinal Salvatore Pappalardo, an Italian who at 86 is too old to vote, told Italian state radio Sunday he was confident the conclave would be guided to the right man.
"Providence sends a pope for every era," he said.
Text of the oath taken by the 115 cardinals voting in the conclave to elect a new pope.
The dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, read the following in Latin: "We, the cardinal electors present in this election of the Supreme Pontiff promise, pledge and swear, as individuals and as a group, to observe faithfully and scrupulously the prescriptions contained in the Apostolic Constitution of the Supreme Pontiff John Paul II, Universi Dominici Gregis, published on 22 February 1996.
We likewise promise, pledge and swear that whichever of us by divine disposition is elected Roman Pontiff will commit himself faithfully to carrying out the munus Petrinum of Pastor of the Universal Church and will not fail to affirm and defend strenuously the spiritual and temporal rights and the liberty of the Holy See.
In a particular way, we promise and swear to observe with the greatest fidelity and with all persons, clerical or lay, secrecy regarding everything that in any way relates to the election of the Roman Pontiff and regarding what occurs in the place of the election, directly or indirectly related to the results of the voting, we promise and swear not to break this secret in any way, either during or after the election of the new Pontiff, unless explicit authorization is granted by the same Pontiff, and never to lend support or favour to any interference, opposition or any other form of intervention, whereby secular authorities of whatever order and degree or any group of people or individuals might wish to intervene in the election of the Roman Pontiff."
Each of the cardinal electors, according to the order of precedence, then took the oath: "And I, (NAME), do so promise, pledge and swear."
Placing his hand on the book of the Gospels, each cardinal added: "So help me God and these Holy Gospels which I touch with my hand."
Black smoke rose from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel Monday evening as cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church signaled that they had voted inconclusively in their first attempt to elect a successor to Pope John Paul II.
For a few moments, the first wisps of smoke looked white to the many spectators drawn to St. Peter's Square in the Vatican and hopes rose that a pope had already been chosen.
Soon, however, the smoke turned decisively black as it wafted from a stovepipe chimney, blowing in the winds at dusk.
The cardinals are to vote again at their conclave on Tuesday.
Earlier Monday, the cardinals retreated behind the heavy wooden doors of the Sistine Chapel and began the tradition laden and secret ceremonies to elect one of their number the 265th pope.
In solemn procession, walking slowly in pairs, they proceeded into the chapel as a choir chanted the Litany of Saints, passing between a pair of Swiss guards in full regalia.
After taking their seats behind long tables, the cardinals were read an oath of secrecy and obedience by their dean, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.
Their birettas, red hats that symbolize the power of their offices, sat on the tables in front of them.
Then they lined up and one by one put their hand on the Gospel and swore to obey.
The entire pageant was televised live, a first in conclave history and in keeping with the tradition of John Paul II, who used television throughout his papacy to promote the faith.
Even in death, his image was broadcast as he lay in state inside St. Peter's Basilica.
"Extra omnes!" cried Piero Marini, the master of papal liturgical ceremonies or "Everyone out!"
He and a theologian chosen to deliver an inspirational message remained.
The rules called for them to leave after the address.
At that point, the cardinals were to decide whether to hold a first round of voting Monday night or not.
Earlier in the day, they heard another message.
Ratzinger, who will be a powerful force in the conclave, took the occasion of a morning Mass dedicated to the election to denounce anyone who would stray from traditional Catholic doctrine.
The 114 other cardinals sat in quarter circles in front of him.
It was the last public rite before the conclave.
"A dictatorship of relativism is being built that recognizes nothing as definite," Ratzinger said, "and which leaves as the ultimate measure only one's ego and desires."
For 25 years, Ratzinger served as John Paul's theological right hand and watchdog as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.
In his writings and public statements, Ratzinger has often sought to uphold the primacy of Catholicism, saying no other religion offered a path to salvation.
"Relativism," he has said, implies wrongly that other faiths are equally valid.
The idea was strongly expressed in a document the congregation issued in 2000, Dominus Iesus, which provoked angry responses from other religious leaders.
In his homily Monday, Ratzinger said that Christians were tossed on the waves of Marxism, liberalism and even "libertinism," of radical individualism, atheism and vague mysticism.
He also decried the creation of "sects" and how people are seduced into them, using a term church leaders often employ to refer to Protestant evangelical movements.
"Having a clear faith, according to the Credo of the Church, is often labeled as fundamentalism," he said.
"Yet relativism, that is, letting oneself being carried 'here and there by any wind of doctrine,' appears as the sole attitude good enough for modern times."
Many of the cardinals, draped in bright red vestments and wearing white mitres, watched intently as Ratzinger spoke on a platform below Bernini's bronze baldacchino.
Several others among them two thirds of the cardinals voting for pope are septuagenarians appeared to doze.
Ratzinger, 78, spoke Italian in heavily accented German, his voice creaky at times and interrupted by coughs.
Several church officials said he had been suffering from a cold.
The cardinal has emerged as a front runner in the election for the next pope, or at least the reference point for a bloc of support generally oriented toward a more conservative position.
He has been a major force among the cardinals since John Paul's death on April 2, celebrating the funeral Mass and leading the cardinals' regular daily meetings.
Commentators agreed that while the cardinal had been saying similar things for decades, hearing them expressed, and so sharply at that, just before the conclave was unexpected.
But there were different interpretations of his intent.
At the funeral, the cardinal showed his pastoral side, said John Peter Pham, a former Vatican diplomat and author of a book about papal succession.
At the Mass Monday, "he's giving evidence that he also has, if you will, the 'vision thing,' that he has definite ideas of where the natural progression of John Paul's theological legacy is," Pham said.
"Whether that's a campaign statement or requirement of what the next guy must have that remains to be seen."
The message is that John Paul's goals must be maintained, he said.
"Either as a candidate or a grand elector, he's definitely in a very strong position, and he wouldn't have made this statement if he was standing alone," Pham said.
Alberto Monticone, a professor of modern history at Lumsa Catholic University in Rome, called the comments "a very clear indication of what in his view the attitude of the next pope should be an attitude of struggle against these evils of the world."
It was likely that most of the cardinals were well familiar with Ratzinger's thinking, and his belief that the church's first priority should be to shore up the doctrinal walls.
"It's very honest," said the Rev. Gerald O'Collins, a theologian at the Gregorian Pontifical University in Rome.
"That's what he thinks."
"Some of the cardinals would not agree with his summation," he said.
"Other things like war and peace and hunger are high on the agenda of other cardinals."
After attending the Mass, the Rev. Raymond J. de Souza, chaplain at Newman House at Queens University in Kingston, Ontario, said that Ratzinger's homily was an "exhortation" to the cardinals to go into the conclave keeping in mind that the primary responsibility of a pope is to preserve the faith passed on from the apostles and not to dilute or experiment with it.
"If the faith is strong, then the church can take on these other issues," said de Souza, who writes a syndicated column.
Professor Hans Kueng, a theologian at the University of Tubingen, who has tangled with Ratzinger, said he heard similar views many years ago from him.
"His ideology is a medieval, anti Reformation, anti modern paradigm of the church and the papacy," he said.
Tens of thousands of faithful had been standing on the cobblestones for hours Monday, all eyes fixed on the narrow stovepipe jutting from the Sistine Chapel, when a curl of smoke whisped into the chilly evening air.
A gasp of disbelief spread quickly through the crowd.
"Is it black?" asked an American priest.
"It's white!" cried a Roman clerk.
A Colombian priest grabbed two strangers in a bear hug, screaming, "It's a pope!"
But within seconds, jubilation gave way to resignation when the chimney began belching decidedly black smoke.
Paz Angelica Casillas, a honeymooner from Mexico, stopped jumping up and down and released her new husband from an embrace.
"I feel like crying," said Casillas, 25, from the town of Tepatitlan.
"We wanted so much for it to be white."
But the world's 1.1 billion Roman Catholics were to spend another night without an earthly leader.
The black smoke signaled that no man had received two thirds of the vote from the 115 cardinals sequestered in the chapel.
White smoke would have meant the world had a new pope.
Thousands of pilgrims began their stakeout in St. Peter's Square early Monday, and as the sun sank in the sky the square began to fill.
By 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) there was a lopsided crowd of tens of thousands, grouped on the south side of the square from which the chimney is visible.
Lines of television cameras were all pointed at the same angle.
Pilgrims trained their cell phone cameras at the chapel roof.
Nuns sat in circles, praying and thumbing through rosaries.
"This is history," said Hernan Aracena, 19, wrapped in a Venezuelan flag.
"As time goes by, this will be one of those moments where you say, 'I was there.'"
Firefighter Lance Smaw dialed home to Mesa, Arizona, to tell his wife Colleen that he was in place.
"We're sitting in the square, waiting for the smoke to come from the chimney," he reported.
"Words cannot describe this place."
Smaw, 35, flew into Rome with three friends Monday morning, leaving Colleen to take care of the kids.
"She's taking one for the team," he said.
"It's just a part of history and a part of a new tomorrow, a new start," he said.
"Not many people have the chance to do something like this."
At the edge of the large column lined square, people paused at a newsstand selling the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, which on Monday featured a four page spread with photos of each of the 115 voting cardinals one of whom almost certainly will be the new pontiff.
Although the conclave can elect any baptized Catholic male as pope, that has rarely been done.
Many of those in the square said they were praying for God to help the cardinals choose their new leader.
"Now what we are all hoping for is that the Lord illuminates the cardinals ,that the Lord through them makes the decision," said Rev. Luis Serrano, a 28 year old priest from Isla Margarita, Venezuela, who is studying theology in Rome.
"It is a very strong burden, choosing the pope who will guide the church."
Sister Monica, a 27 year old Carmelite nun from Ragusa, Italy, said she was confident they would make a wise choice.
"I strongly believe that the Holy Spirit will be the 116th (elector), and the most important one," she said.
"It will be He who will decide it all."
Before the cardinals entered the Sistine Chapel and declared "extra omnes" Latin for "all out" they held a final Mass, which was broadcast on four giant screens in the square.
Thousands of people turned out, many weeping as they absorbed the solemnity of the occasion.
Rwandan nuns in blue habits, Filipino monks in gray robes and tourists in T shirts mixed together, shaking hands and hugging in the sign of peace.
Tears streamed down the faces of Leila Mota and Mariana Dias as they embraced tightly.
"For the rest of my life, I'll keep this moment in my heart," said Dias, a 27 year old architect from Natal, Brazil.
"The emotion is so strong, the faith is so great."
Sobbing, she said she could feel John Paul's presence.
"I've seen Masses here on television, but I never imagined when I got here I'd feel him so close to me," she said.
Many of the pilgrims said they would come to the square every day until a cardinal cries from a Vatican balcony "Habemus papam" "We have a pope" however long it takes.
"This is the first conclave of the new millennium," said Sister Jolanta, a 29 year old Polish nun.
"This election involves not only the church, but all of humanity."
When Pope John Paul II arrived at Opus Dei headquarters one March day 11 years ago, even members of the conservative lay religious movement long accustomed to Vatican favor saw the visit as a singular moment in the group's ascendancy within the Roman Catholic Church.
The pope had come to pay his respects to Bishop Alvaro del Portillo, the prelate of Opus Dei, who had died that day.
"He came over to pray before the body of Don Alvaro, which is a very unusual thing to have a pope come over to your house to pray," said the Rev. John Wauck, a professor at the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross, an Opus Dei institution in Rome.
Now with its papal benefactor gone, Opus Dei's influence under the next pope and its role in choosing the new pontiff have become hot topics in a city awash in speculation as the world's cardinals meet behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel to elect John Paul's successor.
Opus Dei, or "Work of God," was founded in Spain in 1928.
It is based on the idea that Catholics, male and female, can live a sanctified life without being priests or nuns.
Many of its 85000 worldwide members work in legal, medical, financial and media professions and profess unquestioned fidelity to the church's teachings and loyalty to the pope.
But critics have called the group elitist, and it is depicted as a villainous secret society in Dan Brown's best selling novel, "The Da Vinci Code."
Officially, Opus Dei has stressed that it is above the fray.
Its prelate, Bishop Javier Echevarria, has called for prayer, not politicking.
He has pledged the group's loyalty to whomever the cardinals elect.
"We already love with our whole soul the successor of John Paul II, whoever he may be," Echevarria wrote to the organization's members.
"Let us renew our desire to serve the pope, for it was only to serve the church that God wanted Opus Dei."
Others note that, for the first time, two of the 115 voting cardinals Julian Herranz of Spain and Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne of Lima, Peru, are members of Opus Dei, giving the group the ability to work inside the conclave.
"They have a chance to lobby the other cardinals from an inside position," said an official with a lay organization with close ties to the Vatican.
"Opus Dei has international connections, they know many cardinals, are appreciated by some.
They are entitled to talk to cardinals, to invite them to dinner, all with authority."
Several European cardinals are known to be sympathetic to Opus Dei, among them Cardinal Camillo Ruini, the Italian prelate who runs the Diocese of Rome on behalf of the pope, and a contender to succeed John Paul.
It was Ruini who last year opened proceedings to declare Opus Dei's del Portillo a saint.
But recently, several Italian newspapers breathlessly reported that the two Opus Dei cardinals were throwing their support behind the candidacy of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, a German born traditionalist who has served as chief enforcer of church doctrine for two decades.
Opus Dei flourished during John Paul's pontificate.
In 1982, he took the unprecedented step of making Opus Dei a personal prelature of the church, answerable not to local bishops in the dioceses where it operated, but to the pope alone through the Sacred Congregation of Bishops at the Holy See.
In another sign of the group's influence, the pope placed Opus Dei's founder, the Spanish priest Josemaria Escriva de Balaguer on the fast track to sainthood in 1992, leapfrogging over Pope John XXIII.
In 2002, Escriva was canonized before a crowd of 300000 in St. Peter's Square, becoming Saint Josemaria a mere 27 years after he died.
The Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit and associate editor of his religious order's magazine, America, said it was undeniable that Opus Dei had a stake in the election of the new pope.
"They would not have grown so quickly and have gained the influence they have were it not for John Paul," he said.
"Given that they're ,responsible only to the pope, that is a sword that cuts both ways.
If you have a pope who is favorable to you, that's terrific.
If you have a pope who does not see things the way Opus Dei does, that's more problematic."
Opus Dei officials have greeted the speculation about its role in choosing a new pope with a mixture of political realism and amusement.
"Opus Dei has no candidate," Wauck said.
He said he thought the interest was due in no small part to "The Da Vinci Code," whose depiction of Opus Dei is disputed by the group as inaccurate and misleading.
In an interview before the pope's death, Herranz, one of the Opus Dei cardinals, was asked whether an Opus Dei member could become pope, given that its reputation is negative in some quarters.
Herranz said the organization had been subjected to negative publicity, but that such attacks were attacks on Christianity as a whole, not just Opus Dei.
"Opus Dei has become a victim of Christian phobia," Herranz said.
But, he said, "more people today love Opus Dei than don't.
And we have a saint now, our founder Escriva, so more people understand the good works and spiritual doctrine of Opus Dei."
Critics of Opus Dei have said the church's decision to make Escriva a saint was disturbing in view of his friendship with Spain's late fascist dictator, Francisco Franco.
Opus Dei spokesman Brian Finnerty said that, during those decades, Opus Dei included both backers and opponents of Franco.
Escriva hewed to the theologically conservative stances shared by John Paul, including strict adherence to the church's teaching on sexual and moral issues.
He also spoke out against "godless" communism.
As for the future, Opus Dei officials say they are not worried.
Their status in the church as a personal prelature is cast in canon law and is not subject to a particular pope's goodwill.
To alter Opus Dei's status, a new pope would have to change the canon law, and not even liberals in the church expect that to happen.
"From the pope's vantage point, what's not to like?"
Martin, the Jesuit priest, asked.
"First, you have all these dedicated lay Catholics.
Secondly, you have Opus Dei's affluent members donating money to the Vatican.
And you have Opus Dei members adhering to the magisterium (official church teachings) as strictly as possible."
The conservative Roman Catholic group Opus Dei, which enjoyed firm support from the late Pope John Paul II, welcomed Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger's election Tuesday as his successor.
Opus Dei's prelate, Bishop Javier Echevarria, issued a statement pledging support for the new pontiff.
"This is a time of great joy," Echevarria said.
Opus Dei has what is called a "personal prelature", meaning it does not answer to a local bishop.
Echevarria said "the new pope knows the mission of the prelature and knows he can rely on the joyful dedication of the priests and lay people who compose it to serve the church."
Cardinals sequestered in the Sistine Chapel to elect a pope use an iron stove and its narrow metal chimney to announce their decision.
Black smoke means they have failed, white smoke means they have succeeded.
It's unclear when the tradition began, but smoke signals have been used continuously since at least 1878.
There is little record of color confusion until the 1958 conclave, when the damp straw that the cardinals had added to their burning ballots apparently failed to catch, and the initial smoke was white.
There was some confusion Monday when the first wisps of smoke appeared white to some observers.
But it quickly became clear that it was black.
The Vatican said after Pope John Paul II's death that special chemicals would be added to help avoid confusion.
Archbishop Piero Marini, master of ceremonies for liturgical celebrations, also has said when a new pope is chosen, the Vatican will ring the bells of St. Peter's Basilica, in addition to burning the ballots, "to make the election of the pope clearer."
But when the bells rang Tuesday and black smoke poured from the chimney, people in St. Peter's Square were further confused.
It soon became clear that the bells were simply tolling because it was noon.
In past centuries, conclaves were often held in the town where the last pope died, leaving the cardinals to come up with a means of communication on the spot.
They sometimes rang bells to signal a successful election.
Smoke was a logical choice because church tradition calls for the cardinals to burn their ballots after each vote to maintain secrecy about the conclave.
Rome Cardinals from 52 nations, signaling their first vote with a puff of black smoke, began Monday night the process of selecting the 265th leader of the world's oldest dynasty the Roman Catholic Church.
The stream of black smoke from the chimney over the Sistine Chapel meant the 115 voting red robed "princes" of the church had not reached any conclusion in their search for a successor to Pope John Paul II and would return to the chapel this morning for more balloting.
White smoke would have meant a new pontiff.
Tens of thousands of faithful watched from St. Peter's Square millions more on television as smoke poured from the chapel's chimney.
"It seems white,No, no, it's black!" reported Vatican Radio as the first pale wisps slipped out from the narrow metal pipe and then quickly darkened.
Few expected a hasty decision.
The cardinals have a staggering range of issues to juggle, from bioethical and medical issues to the church's relations with Islam, Judaism and other Christian churches.
The conclave began as the cardinals filed into the Sistine Chapel, the magnificent chamber adorned by Michelangelo in the 16th century and swept last week for electronic listening devices.
It was the first time in more than a quarter of a century that church leaders have gathered to elect a supreme pontiff.
And, for the first time ever, television cameras broadcast the opening ceremonies and the cardinals' procession into the chapel live into St. Peter's Square, and around the world.
After their procession into the chapel, the cardinals walked up to a small wooden table and placed their right hands on a large Bible, swearing to uphold the rules of the conclave and to keep its proceedings secret.
There is no clear front runner among the 115 cardinals as to who will replace John Paul to become the next pope and lead the 1.1 billion member church in the new millennium.
The day of solemn ritual began in the morning in St. Peter's Basilica with a special Mass for the Election of the Roman Pontiff, attended by thousands of faithful and all of the 115 cardinals.
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the dean of the College of Cardinals, played a major role in the pre conclave Mass just as he did during the late pope's funeral Mass 10 days ago.
In a stern homily delivered to a packed church, Ratzinger said "being an adult means having a faith which does not follow the waves of today's fashions or latest novelties."
It was classic Ratzinger.
He, along with John Paul, has spent more than two decades reining in the purported liberal excesses of the Second Vatican Council, the sweeping church reforms in the 1960s that brought the Roman church into the modern world.
"Having a clear faith, based on the creed of the church, is often labeled today as a fundamentalism," Ratzinger said in his homily.
"Whereas relativism, which is letting oneself be tossed and swept along by every wind of teaching, looks like the only attitude acceptable to today's standards," he said.
"We are moving toward a dictatorship of relativism which does not recognize anything as for certain and which has as its highest goal one's own ego and one's own desires."
Ratzinger's sermon was greeted with a spattering of applause, including polite acknowledgment from a dozen of the assembled cardinals.
But there was sustained applause at the end of the two hour Mass as the cardinals some of them smiling filed past Michelangelo's Pieta, the famous sculpture of Mary holding the body of Jesus Christ.
It was the last public event before the cardinals were sequestered into the conclave.
On the steps of the basilica, John and Bonnie Glossinger of Mill Valley paused to reflect on the morning's historic events.
"It was very impressive," said John Glossinger, was who on a business trip to Munich and just happened to be in Rome this week with his wife.
"All of us just stood there in awe," Bonnie Glossinger added.
The smoke from the Sistine Chapel in the last moments of twilight Monday indicated there was a first ballot vote that resulted in no one receiving the two thirds' majority required to become pope.
Voting is conducted under a strict veil of secrecy.
The ballots are burned with chemical additives creating black or white smoke.
In recent conclaves, the single evening vote on the first day of the gathering has been a largely ceremonial affair.
Ratzinger, 78, a conservative German cardinal and the chief enforcer of Catholic orthodoxy during John Paul's reign, was thought to be in line for a sizable number of those votes.
Vatican insiders also predicted that Cardinal Carlo Martini, the archbishop of Milan and a comparatively liberal church leader, would receive a block of votes of his own from those opposed to Ratzinger.
Martini, who turned 78 in February, is not seen as a serious papal contender, partly because of his relatively liberal views and partly because he suffers from Parkinson's disease, the same ailment that led to John Paul II's demise.
Serious balloting is to start today, with two votes in the morning and two in the afternoon.
Monsignor Charles Burns, an Irish priest and archivist for the past 35 years at the Vatican Secret Archives, said the tradition of locking up the cardinals dates back to the 13th century.
The cardinals, he said, were taking months to elect the new pope spending more time hunting and feasting than in serious deliberation.
"It wasn't to keep people out," he said.
"It was to keep the cardinals in."
It took the conclave nearly three years to elect Pope Gregory X in 1271.
The election came only after a mob tore the roof off the building where the cardinals met, exposing them to the elements, and put them on a diet of bread and water to force a decision.
This year's conclave is not expected to last that long, even though Pope John Paul built a new hotel, Santa Marta, for the cardinals on Vatican grounds, giving them more comfortable accommodations.
Many "Vaticanistas," those on the permanent papal press corps, predict it will take two to three days to elect a new pope.
Cardinals were deadlocked Tuesday in their search for a new leader of the Roman Catholic Church, as black smoke emerging from a Vatican chimney signalled they had failed in two new votes to elect a pope.
To the disappointment of the thousands of people gathered on Saint Peter's Square, the smoke puffing out of the copper chimney above the Sistine Chapel was emphatically not the white they had been hoping for to signal a new pope.
For a brief moment there was heart stopping confusion as the smoke appeared white, and the crowd surged forward toward the Vatican balcony already decked out in purple curtains for the new pope's first public appearance.
Again, as after the first ballot late Monday, the plumes turned black and the crowd subsided.
"We really thought we had it," said Brother Eldi, a monk from Brazil after rushing forward toward the basilica.
But less than 15 minutes later more smoke emerged from the chimney, sowing confusion until it too turned black.
Vatican television said it was likely the inconclusive ballots were burned in two batches, one for each unsuccessful round.
Tuesday's signals mean that the 115 cardinals sequestered in the splendour of the Sistine have now failed in three votes to agree on a successor to John Paul II as the 265th leader of the world's 1.1 billion Roman Catholics.
Under a Vatican timetable, the prelates are to convene twice a day, in the morning and the afternoon, and vote twice in each session.
In theory, the white smoke signalling a successful election could occur at any time during those hours.
The cardinals had earlier trooped back into the Sistine Chapel from their secluded Santa Marta residence.
Once inside, they prayed before resuming their deliberations.
After the mourning and public emotion over the death of John Paul II, when millions of pilgrims packed into Rome and hundreds of state leaders attended his funeral, the election of his successor is once again keeping the world in suspense.
Vatican watchers, rebuffed by the hi tech secrecy surrounding the debate, were reduced to speculating Tuesday on the course ahead.
"Black smoke, time to negotiate," headlined the daily Corriere della Sera, citing the only outward indication so far available.
"The conclave is looking for agreement after the Martini Ratzinger duel," the paper said, referring to the leaders of opposing camps apparently led by moderate Italian Carlo Maria Martini and the arch conservative German Joseph Ratzinger.
If they cancel each other out as many expect, other possible popes include Dionigi Tettamanzi, the archbishop of Milan who is seen as less conservative than Ratzinger.
Bookies have also listed the likes of Nigeria's Francis Arinze, Jean Marie Lustiger of France, Claudio Hummes of Brazil and the Honduran, Oscar Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga as possible compromise candidates.
Predicting an outcome as early as Tuesday, the Corriere della Sera said the cardinals were likely to have broken out into groups, possibly determined by common languages, with "delegates" from the two camps as well as a third Latin American current.
Whoever is elected pope will take the Church into a new era at a time when Roman Catholicism faces stern doctrinal and moral dilemmas, with conservatives keen to uphold the late pope's strict stance on abortion, contraception, the celibacy of priests and the ordination of women.
But many in the Church are pressing for a relaxation of certain strictures, notably to allow condoms in the fight against AIDS but also on issues such as allowing clerics to marry to encourage more to join the dwindling priesthood.
To ensure the utmost secrecy during the voting process, the Sistine Chapel normally packed with tourists admiring the magnificent frescoes including Michelangelo's Last Judgment has been swept for bugs and a special system installed to scramble any mobile telephone communications.
Even the Santa Marta residence has been stripped of televisions, radio and newspapers, and extra precautions have been taken to ensure the cardinals do not cross paths with any Vatican official or member of the public.
Joseph Ratzinger, a renowned theologian and provocative hard line enforcer of Catholic Church doctrine for the past two decades, was chosen Tuesday to succeed his friend and close ally Pope John Paul II.
Ratzinger, 78, became Pope Benedict XVI, the 265th leader of the world's largest and most powerful Christian institution.
The swift election of the German born Ratzinger was a vote for continuity of John Paul's policies, signaling an endorsement of the church's most conservative teachings.
The new pope will lead a church in crisis, strongly divided after John Paul's 26 year reign and in sore need of healing.
Despite John Paul's personal magnetism, many of the church's 1 billion members are disaffected.
The faith is losing ground in many parts of the world to other religions and is under threat from radical Islam and secularism.
Minutes after his name was read out to crowds in St. Peter's Square, Ratzinger stepped onto a balcony overlooking the multitude and described himself as "a simple, humble worker in the vineyard of the Lord."
"The fact that the Lord can work and act even with insufficient means consoles me," said the new pope, dressed in flowing white robes and the scarlet papal cape and golden stole, "and above all I entrust myself to your prayers."
Meeting secretly for less than 24 hours, Roman Catholic cardinals locked inside the Sistine Chapel elected Ratzinger on the fourth ballot, then burned the papers on which each had disguised his handwriting and penned a name.
White smoke puffed from a chimney on top of the chapel, signaling to the world that one man had received at least 77 votes, the required two thirds majority for victory.
Details were emerging on how the cardinals made their decision.
While many observers had suggested Ratzinger was too polarizing a figure at this critical juncture in church history, several cardinals appeared to have fallen into line behind the image of a strong leader who represented unambiguous moral authority.
On the morning of his election, Ratzinger had breakfast with four cardinals from Asia and Africa.
He knew them all by name and spoke to them in shared languages, according to Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, who was present.
Ratzinger's tough minded advocacy of Christian identity and the primacy of Catholicism might have appealed to cardinals in parts of the developing world where holders of the faith are under attack and at war with militant Islam or totalitarian regimes.
Over the years, Ratzinger has silenced dissent within the church and labeled other faiths "deficient."
At the same time, Ratzinger, who grew up in Hitler's Germany, often is described by admirers as humble and kind.
Everyone agrees on his acute intellectual prowess.
George Weigel, one of John Paul's biographers, praised the decision.
"The cardinals chose the best known and most respected of their number, a man they each know as a great listener and a sympathetic listener," Weigel said.
"This was not only a tremendous affirmation of the past (26 and a half) years, it was a vote of confidence in Joseph Ratzinger as the man best fitted to give an evangelical thrust to this papacy, a new dynamism in the first decade of the 21st century."
A subdued Belgian Cardinal Gottfried Danneels, possibly the most progressive member of the college, said he hoped Ratzinger's taking of the name Benedict signaled a shift in the German prelate's focus.
"Cardinal Ratzinger remains and will continue to remain the same person," he told a group of reporters Tuesday night.
"But for the moment he is universal pastor of the church.
He is not anymore the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith,When you are a pope, you have to be the pastor of everyone and everything which happens in the church."
Reaction to the election of the oldest pope in two centuries was mixed, both in a St. Peter's Square packed with people eager to hear the news and around the world.
"It is obvious that in today's world with its multitude of opinions, not everyone, even in our own church, could and wanted to follow him," acknowledged Cardinal Karl Lehmann, also of Germany.
"But his theological work was always respected, even by people with differing opinions."
(Optional add end) Since John Paul died April 2 at age 84, Catholics everywhere had waited expectantly to learn who would assume the throne of St. Peter.
The announcement of the new pope was dramatic.
White smoke, indicating a successful election, puffed from a skinny chimney atop the Sistine Chapel at 5:50 p.m., and many onlookers started to cheer.
But the great bell of St. Peter's, which the Vatican had said would ring to coincide with the white smoke, remained still.
Finally, after about five minutes of suspense, the bell began to toll.
Applause and chants of "Viva il Papa" rang out.
People from across Rome converged on St. Peter's Square, running through streets and bridges over the Tiber River to join the swelling crowd.
After about half an hour, Chilean Cardinal Jorge Arturo Medina Estevez, the senior deacon, emerged from behind crimson velvet draperies onto the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square.
In five languages, he greeted "brothers and sisters" and then announced in Latin: "Habemus papum."
"We have a pope."
With a flourish he announced the first name, in Latin, Josephum, followed by a pause for dramatic effect.
And then: Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinalem Ratzinger.
The new pope appeared on the balcony, dressed in the papal vestments.
It was another false alarm but for more than a minute Tuesday, thousands of pilgrims in Saint Peter's Square thought the world had a new pope and ran toward the basilica hoping to be the first to catch a glimpse of him.
"We really thought we had it," said Brother Eldi, a brown robed Capuchin monk from Brazil, camera at the ready.
The puff of light grey smoke later to turn black indicating that the cardinals holding a secret conclave in the Sistine Chapel had again failed to elect a pope emerged just as the basilica's bells was striking the noon hour.
The tolling bells deepened the confusion, since a successful vote is to be accompanied by bells as well as white smoke.
"It was a great emotion," said Carlos Francisco Alejo Oramas, a seminary student from Mexico.
"There were the bells as well."
Eldi's fellow monk, Brother Leonel from Nicaragua, was content with the deadlock in the chapel.
"It reflects the fact that God works slowly but surely," he said.
"This too is the wisdom of the Church, that it doesn't rush things."
Many of the pilgirms, clergy, ordinary tourists and Romans said they would be back Tuesday afternoon when another smoke signal is expected, the result of burning the cardinals' inconclusive ballots and discarded notes.
"I hope they'll elect a pope today, because I have to leave tomorrow," said Manuel Delmestro from the northern Italian city of Turin.
Mike Briggs from Richmond, Virginia, said he had promised his colleagues back home to return with a picture of the white smoke.
"If I go back without it, I'm history," said Briggs.
The same excitement swept the crowd of more than 20000 Monday evening, when many believed the first puffs of grey smoke announced the election of the 264th successor of Saint Peter.
Some have traveled from across the world to stand in the square waiting for the 115 cardinals to announce their choice to succeed pope John Paul II, who died April 2 aged 84.
Father Robert McCulloch, who works as a missionary in Karachi, Pakistan, said he has always wanted to be at the Vatican during the conclave.
"Think of how many people have stood here on this square for hundreds and hundreds of years waiting for a new pope," said the Australian priest.
"You can really feel the bells of history ringing."
Nearby, the Ostzisk family from western Germany, also travelled specially for the conclave.
"It's a historic moment," said Agnes Ostzisk, who plans to stay in a tent with her husband and daughter for the duration of the conclave.
Meanwhile vendors have caught on to the new needs of the crowd: rather than rosaries, many were selling binoculars Tuesday.
As white smoke streamed from the slender chimney on the roof of the Sistine Chapel where the cardinals met to elect a new pope, the crowd of tens of thousands filling St. Peter's Square surged forward.
They shouted with excitement: "Avemos Papa" (We have a pope.)
Some cheered, some sang.
Many whipped out cell phones and typed in the words "white smoke."
But when Chilean Cardinal Jorge Arturo Medina Estevez announced that the new leader of the world's billion Catholics was Josef Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, electricity seemed to give way to matter of factness.
"We don't know much about him, except that he's quite closely linked with John Paul II," said Ursula Kelly of Ireland's County Derry who was in Rome with her husband for their 15th wedding anniversary.
"But we're just so glad to see it."
Some groups applauded, some cheered, but the overwhelming sentiment was that a larger figure still loomed over the scene Pope John Paul II, who died earlier this month.
"It's a hard act to follow.
He is the only pope I've known," said Paul Anderson, 25, a resident adviser in Loyola University of Chicago's semester abroad program in Rome.
Ratzinger seemed to sense the shadow as well.
When he emerged onto the marble balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square, the first sentence he uttered as Benedict XVI was an acknowledgment of his predecessor's power.
"After the great Pope John Paul II, the cardinals elected me, a simple, humble worker in the vineyards of the Lord," he said.
He raised his arms, turning from side to side, clasped his hands together and blew a kiss to the crowd, which filled the vast square and spilled into adjoining streets.
The new pope appeared stiff and reserved.
Cardinal Justin Francis Rigali of Philadelphia, who was looking down at the same crowd from one of the adjacent balconies at the Vatican, described a scene of majesty as he looked out over St. Peter's Square.
"I was on the balcony to the right, and what a view it was!
All these tens of thousands of people and the wonderful welcome they gave the new pope.
You heard them chant 'Benedicto, Benedicto.'
So it started off well," he said.
Silvana Dal Mas, an elderly sister of the Little Daughters of the Heart of Jesus, who had come to Rome for the conclave and elbowed her way to the front of the crowd, had said she would prefer a Latin American pope, but when Ratzinger was named she quickly adjusted her sights.
"I am happy," she said, looking up at the balconies filled with cardinals.
"People think the Germans are hard, but I come from near the border with Austria, and when the Germans love, it's sincere.
This pope will,," she paused.
"He will work very well."
Mario Marazziti, spokesman and a founding member of the Saint Egidio Community a Catholic social movement that works with the poor and refugees raced to St. Peter's Square when he heard news of the white smoke.
He found himself surprised by the new pope's demeanor.
The usually stern Ratzinger seemed awestruck, even timid as he stood on the balcony of the basilica, looking out at the crowd that had assembled to greet him.
"I think he was uncertain, he was intimidated tonight," Marazitti said Tuesday.
"He used minimalist words.
And all of us today are the children of John Paul II who regard this strong and timid man ,I was moved, I found it tender."
Most excited about his election were groups of young people who had been devoted to John Paul and were eager to transfer their affections to a new spiritual leader.
Bree Dail, 23, who attends Christendom College in Front Royal, Va., snagged a seat in the front row on both Monday and Tuesday along with a handful of her fellow students so that she could watch the new pope from close up.
For much of the day, she had prayed the rosary with her friends, hoping that the cardinals would make their choice.
When she heard Ratzinger's name, she leapt up, shouting and cheering although she, like so many others, could not help but connect him to the previous pope.
"They gave us the best, he (Ratzinger) has the heart of the holy father," she said.
"We are happy, we are ecstatic, it's like we have a father."
The day was overcast and chilly.
Dark clouds scudded across the sky, making it hard to tell whether the initial curl of smoke rising at dusk from the Sistine Chapel was gray tending to black or gray tending to white.
As the crowd called out "Bianco, bianco" a priest, his cell phone glued to one ear, came out on one of the terraces that sit atop the majestic colonnade surrounding St. Peter's Square and gestured frantically at the bell tower.
John Paul had decreed that in addition to sending up white smoke, the Vatican should ring the bells to announce a papal election.
The piazza that had only scattered groups of people earlier in the day appeared suddenly to have filled to bursting.
A group of Spanish nuns leapt onto chairs and began to chant "we have a pope."
An older nun reproved them.
"You don't know for certain yet," she said.
So when the great bell finally began to sound, its ring was overwhelmed by the roar of the crowd, relieved and excited that the election of a new pope was real.
Some waved papal flags, others flags from their home countries Germany and Honduras, Mexico and the United States.
As people waited, there were lulls in the cheers and some began to sing Italian hymns or chant prayers in Latin.
Vatican staff priests, nuns and lay workers came out on the roof of the buildings surrounding St. Peter's to watch the ceremony.
News and television photographers staged themselves between the statues that crown the colonnade.
As the cardinals prepared to introduce the new pope, acolytes unfurled a velvet banner with the seal of John Paul and hung it in front of the balcony.
Then, the grand glass doors behind the papal balcony were opened and a long, deep red curtain let fall, making more dramatic the new pope's entrance as it was pushed aside to make way for him.
The voting cardinals gathered on adjoining balconies, their scarlet cassocks and skullcaps contrasting sharply with the white marble, creating a vivid tableaux, but also a moment of sober ceremony as they watched one of their own move into the most elite realm in Christendom.
After a greeting and a few words, Ratzinger said: "I entrust myself to your prayers," as the crowd chanted his new papal name.
With the dusk deepening and a damp wind rising, he ducked back inside the Vatican.
With the new pope's departure, the crowd began to drift off.
A group known as "Papa Boys," an informal youth group that sprang up during John Paul's jubilee year, rallied a large circle of young Catholics to sing.
Many said they were hoping the new pope would reappear.
Many who stood on the periphery of the swaying crowd of teenagers and twentysomethings had more questions than answers.
"We'll see if he has enough charisma to face this crisis of faith that we have in the church with people drifting away," said Elena Fonte, 35, a lawyer.
"I still think of John Paul II as pope, not of Ratzinger as pope."
Times staff writers Sebastian Rotella and Geraldine Baum contributed to this report.
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Tuesday called the choice of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as pope an "honor" for Germany.
Ratzinger's election is "a great honor for our whole country," Schroeder told reporters.
Schroeder said Ratzinger, who will be known as Pope Benedict XVI, was a renowned theologian across the world, and said he looked forward to him attending World Youth Day in Cologne, Germany, in August.
German President Horst Koehler added: "That a fellow countryman has become pope fills us with a special joy in Germany and also a little pride."
Pope Benedict XVI may travel less than his globetrotting predecessor, but few expect him to act like a caretaker pope.
Rather, the 78 year old pontiff is expected to pursue an activist agenda, topped by a mission to revitalize the Catholic faith and identity where it is threatened by secularism, particularly in Europe.
But after persuading two thirds of the College of Cardinals to elect him, the new pontiff must now lead a 1 billion member flock that is deeply divided over the church's direction and his own promise to stay the course.
How he will persuade Catholics that he is pastor to them all is uncertain.
The mixed reaction to the election of Cardinal Joseph Ratzlinger reflects his familiar role as a lightning rod for the harshest criticism leveled at John Paul's 26 year reign.
It was Ratzinger whose Vatican doctrinal office silenced or reprimanded more than 100 Catholic theologians, according to some estimates.
He epitomized a centralization of authority in the Vatican under John Paul, at the expense of local bishops, while enforcing church doctrine against married priests, women in the priesthood, remarriage for divorced Catholics, and homosexual liaisons.
Catholics around the world welcomed Ratzinger's election as an act inspired by God.
Many others said they were in shock.
"This is a disaster," said Rea Howarth, co director of the Quixote Center, a Catholic lay organization based in Brentwood, Md., that is involved in human rights work in Latin America.
"The church has lost so much credibility.
Now I'm afraid that more Catholics will just turn their backs and walk away."
"Ratzinger is a polarizing figure, who seems to prefer combativeness to compromise and compassion," said Mary Grant, a spokeswoman for Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.
But some prominent critics of Ratzinger said they were hoping for something different in Pope Benedict.
The new pontiff held out what some saw as an olive branch in the way he explained the inspiration for his name: Pope Benedict XV, who ran the church during World War I, had given himself to "peacemaking, reconciliation and harmony," the new pope said.
That explanation, said Cardinal Gottfried Danneels of Belgium, "gives me some hope" that Ratzinger will listen to demands from bishops for more "collegiality," or democracy, in church governance.
The Rev. Hans Kung of Germany, who was stripped of his authority by Ratzinger to teach at Catholic universities for questioning church teachings, called Ratzinger's election "an enormous disappointment" but added: "The papacy is such a challenge that it can change anyone,Let us therefore give him a chance."
Kung noted that Pope John XXIII, who reigned from 1958 63, had started as a conservative but turned more progressive.
Still, the overriding message of Ratzinger's election, on the second day of secret voting in the Sistine Chapel, was continuity with John Paul.
"Of all the men in that room, Cardinal Ratzinger was certainly the smartest and the one who most represented John Paul II's theology and view of the world," said Father Thomas Reese, editor of the New York based Jesuit magazine America.
"They picked the man who would carry on with that legacy."
In an editorial last week, Reese warned the cardinals that "a church that cannot openly discuss issues is a church retreating into an intellectual ghetto."
He said the next pope must be open to a priesthood that admits women and married men.
After Ratzinger's election, Reese said it was clear that such issues "will simply remain off the table."
"He sees his first task as protecting the traditional identity of Catholics in the world against an infinite sea of threats," said John Allen, who wrote a biography of Cardinal Ratzinger.
Opening the priesthood, for example, "might create a slippery slope down which the church risks losing its identity," the author said.
"Obviously, the keystone of the Ratzinger pontificate will be one of preserving traditional teachings rather than tinkering with them," Allen added.
The new pope is expected to stress "culture of life" issues, doing battle against gay marriage, euthanasia and stem cell research.
He would ensure that theological speculation is contained within narrow limits.
His governing metaphor for the church of the future is the mustard seed, it might have to be smaller to be faithful what he calls a "creative minority."
His focus on Europe is a reaction, in part, to setbacks the Vatican suffered last year when the European Union refused to mention the continent's Christian roots in its new constitution, a decision both John Paul and Ratzinger publicly criticized.
Ratzinger's papacy could differ from John Paul's in some important ways.
He is likely to spend more time at the Vatican, whipping the Curia, or Vatican bureaucracy, into line with his goals of a more rigorously indoctrinated clergy, an improvement of the liturgy and a renewal of missionary work.
Like most conservatives, he is averse to big government and might streamline the church's central apparatus.
And while the late pope championed outreach to leaders of other faiths, Ratzinger has said it is of utmost importance to maintain Catholicism as a superior religion.
In the 2000 document "Dominus Iesus" (Lord Jesus), Ratzinger asserted Catholic primacy and branded other faiths, including Christian denominations, as deficient.
The document incurred the wrath of Protestants, Anglicans, Jews and others.
Ratzinger dismissed the protests as insignificant, further angering his critics.
Last year, Ratzinger said Turkey should not be allowed to join the European Union because, as a predominantly Muslim country, it was "in permanent conflict" with Europe.
The debate has washed over the church, with many struggling over whether fundamental differences between the two religions whose believers are in conflict in parts of the world can be bridged for the sake of dialogue and on the basis of shared moral values.
Many cardinals from Asia and Africa, where Catholicism is a minority religion, admired Ratzinger's assertive promotion of the faith.
Although voting was secret, several Vatican watchers speculated that significant numbers of cardinals from those continents joined with their conservative peers in Europe to give Ratzinger the majority he needed.
George Weigel, an American biographer of the late pope, said Ratzinger had won enough support among Third World cardinals to isolate a progressive bloc from Europe and the United States that had opposed his candidacy.
"Popes don't invent Catholicism anew," Weigel said, dismissing the idea liberal American Catholics inspired by church reforms of the 1960s could sway the new pontiff.
"The Catholic Church isn't going to alter fundamental points of doctrine and moral teaching.
If people want to keep fighting the battles of 40 years ago, that's their choice, but the church is moving on."
Once cardinals choose a leader for the church, the new pope is swept into a tradition steeped ritual formally accepting his mission, donning white papal vestments and greeting the crowds from a balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square.
The chain of traditional events: THE ACCEPTANCE After the vote, cardinals burst into applause for the new pope.
As dean of the College of Cardinals, Germany's Joseph Ratzinger was designated to ask if the man chosen accepts, but since the cardinal chosen was Ratzinger, it was not immediately clear who posed the question.
A decree by John Paul II urged the winner not to refuse the office "for fear of its weight.")
The pontiff then responds "accepto" Latin for "I accept."
THE NAMING The pope is asked to announce a papal name.
He is free to pick from any of his 264 predecessors, use his own first name or come up with something new.
Ratzinger's choice of Benedict XVI will be closely scrutinized for clues about the future tone of his papacy.
At some point, cardinals kneel before the pope to honor him.
THE DONNING OF PAPAL VESTMENTS The pontiff is led out of the Sistine Chapel to a dressing chamber nicknamed the "Room of Tears," because some popes have been overcome by emotion there.
He is offered a choice of vestments small, medium and large that have been hand sewed by Rome tailors.
Vatican nuns will make possible adjustments.
THE ANNOUNCEMENT When the pope was ready, the protodeacon Chilean Cardinal Jorge Arturo Medina Estevez stepped onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica overlooking St. Peter's Square and proclaims, "Habemus papam!"
"We have a pope!"
Medina then announced the pope's name, reading his first name out in Latin and his family name in its normal form.
The new pontiff stepped out on the balcony and raised his hands, clasped together.
Afterward, the pope might ask the cardinals to return to the conclave and share a meal.
John Paul II did, and even passed around glasses of champagne.
It's crunch time on a major piece of immigration legislation and all sides are stepping up the pressure.
The Real ID Act, which restricts illegal immigrants from getting driver's licenses and tightens asylum laws, is expected to be approved or rejected by House and Senate negotiators Thursday.
Proponents of the measure including a group of immigration control activists in town for a week of lobbying said they were cautiously optimistic, especially after the White House endorsed it in a letter to House and Senate conferees earlier this week.
"We feel pretty good about it," said Carlos Espinosa, spokesman for Rep Tom Tancredo, R Colo., a leading critic of illegal immigration.
Jeff Lungren, a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee, said that negotiations on the Real ID Act "are going well" and involved the leadership in both chambers.
But Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D Nev., said that Democrats have been "completely shut out of the backroom negotiations" in "yet another example of the Republican leadership's abuse of power."
"This legislation would make sweeping, controversial changes to our laws with respect to the environment, refugees, judicial review, the states' power to make decisions about their own laws, and other issues," Reid said.
"This legislation has never been considered by the Senate.
It has not been subjected to any hearings, debate, amendments, or any votes at all by this body."
Other opponents of the immigration measure including immigrant advocates, religious groups, human rights organizations, the National Conference of State Legislators, and the American Civil Liberties Union were trying hard to stop it.
Several of the groups were planning a telephone conference call on Thursday to urge lawmakers to drop the legislation from a larger emergency spending bill.
"This country has been known to have safe haven for people, and we're fearful that, with this measure, that won't happen," said Judith Golub, senior director of advocacy and public affairs of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.
House and Senate negotiators are working to reconcile two versions of the emergency spending bill, one of which includes the immigration provisions.
The bill is urgently needed to fund military operations and rebuilding efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as tsunami relief efforts in Asia.
The Real ID Act was added to the spending bill in the House in an effort spearheaded by Rep James Sensenbrenner, R Wis., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
The Senate version did not include the immigration provisions.
The bill would require people applying for or renewing driver's licenses to confirm their legal status in the United States.
The residents of states that don't comply won't be allowed to use the driver's licenses as identification to board planes or apply for Social Security and other benefits.
Proponents say the measure would stop foreign terrorists from obtaining driver's licenses which they could use to travel in the United States and would also stop terrorists from taking advantage of U.S. asylum laws.
Opponents say that the Real ID Act is an anti immigrant measure that would not improve security and hasn't been vetted through the congressional process.
Critics say the measure would result in more dangerous roadways, with thousands of illegal immigrants driving without licenses or insurance.
In addition, the American Civil Liberties Union says that a provision in the bill to link state driver's license databases would create a de facto national ID card and a "show us your papers" society.
The driver's licence issue has energized groups upset about illegal immigration.
Some are in Washington this week for a six day lobbying effort on various immigration topics.
It includes a gathering of 18 radio talk show hosts from around the country.
At a press conference Tuesday hosted by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that advocates reducing immigration, Rep Dana Rohrabacher, R Calif., said that illegal immigration is "threatening to our very survival as a nation" because it brings down wages and "destroys our health care and education system."
"They don't deserve a drivers license, they deserve to be driven to the border," and thrown over, said Rohrabacher, a nine term lawmaker who chairs a science subcommittee.
The comment drew raucous applause and cheers from the crowd of about 150 people.
WASHINGTON Congress is poised to pass a law that would make sweeping changes to the nation's system for issuing driver's licenses by imposing stringent requirements on states to verify the authenticity of birth certificates, Social Security cards, legal residency visas, and bank and utility records used to obtain a license.
House Republicans attached the bill to a must pass supplemental spending package for troops in Iraq without first putting it through the usual legislative scrutiny of hearings and debate.
Should it emerge intact from House Senate negotiations over the spending package, it could be law next month.
Touted as an antiterrorism measure, the "Real ID Act" would also overturn laws in nine states that allow illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.
If a state does not comply with any provision of the law, its residents would no longer be able to use their driver's licenses for federal identification purposes, such as for boarding a plane.
The law, some say, would effectively turn the new driver's license into a national identification card.
Its chief champion, House Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, says the measure would help prevent terrorists from fraudulently gaining official documents that would allow them to enter the country and move freely.
Another set of provisions would significantly raise the standard of proof that asylum applicants must meet when claiming that they have been persecuted on ethnic, religious, or political grounds.
It would also grant greater discretion to Homeland Security officials to reject asylum seekers and curtail the ability of appeals courts to issue stays of deportation orders and review rejected cases.
Terrorists have "used almost every conceivable means of entering the country," Sensenbrenner said in a statement provided by an aide.
"They have come as students, tourists, and business visitors.
They have also been legal permanent residents and naturalized US citizens.
They have snuck across the border illegally, arrived as stowaways on ships, used false passports, and have been granted amnesty.
Terrorists have even used America's humanitarian tradition of welcoming those seeking asylum.
We must plug these gaps."
But many critics of the Real ID Act say that it goes too far and that its language is riddled with problems that might have been corrected through the normal legislative review process.
"This bill has not received a single hearing in either chamber of Congress, so the challenges it presents for states have never received any attention," said Cheye Calvo of the National Conference of State Legislatures.
"It does much more than just deny driver's licenses to illegal immigrants."
State legislators and governors say that the Real ID Act would lead to horrific delays at motor vehicle bureaus, that it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars more than Congress thinks, and that it would impose an unrealistic three year deadline for having the verification system in place.
Moreover, civil libertarians argue that by creating uniform national standards for driver's licenses and requiring states to pool driver information in a national database, the bill is a back door move to creating a national identification card, which they oppose on privacy grounds.
And immigrant advocates fear the asylum changes are too draconian and will hurt people with legitimate claims of persecution.
But Sensenbrenner is pushing hard to keep the measure on the final Iraq spending bill, and his opinion carries special weight in Congress.
Republican leaders promised him last December that the Real ID Act would get a quick hearing in 2005 after he agreed to remove it from a major intelligence overhaul bill that the Bush administration needed to pass.
Moreover, political observers say the Bush administration is unwilling to antagonize Sensenbrenner because, as Judiciary Committee chairman, he will hold sway over President Bush's proposal to reform the immigration system by establishing a system of guest worker visas.
"They're going to stick it on the supplemental, and it's going to stay on there," Senate minority leader Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said Monday.
"It's a terrible piece of legislation,They put it on a supplemental, which they knew you couldn't stop.
I've had a senator come to me and say, 'We're going to filibuster this.'
I said, 'Get real.
It's not going to happen.
It's a defense bill."'
Six Republican senators last week expressed similar concerns when they signed a letter asking Senate majority leader Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, not to let the Real ID Act appear in the final bill.
They were led by Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, a lawmaker close to evangelical Christian groups who are particularly concerned about the asylum provisions.
"Legislating in such a complex area without the benefit of hearings and expert testimony is a dubious exercise and one that subverts the Senate's deliberative process," said the letter, which was also signed by Republicans John McCain of Arizona, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, John Sununu of New Hampshire, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, and Richard Lugar of Indiana.
Jeff Lungren, a Sensenbrenner spokesman, Monday rejected the notion that the bill could use further debate, arguing that the policy proposals contained in the Real ID Act have been public since Sensenbrenner tried unsuccessfully to include them in the 2004 intelligence overhaul law.
"Since that intelligence bill passed about five months or so ago, this issue has continued to be at the forefront," Lungren said.
"Just because some senators have chosen not to address it and to ignore it doesn't mean that we don't need to have these provisions and bolster our border security now."
Cory Smith, who has been tracking the asylum provisions for Human Rights First, called Lungren's comments "disingenuous."
"I'm sure at some place somewhere years ago something about asylum was brought up, but there were no hearings on this," he said.
"There has not been careful consideration of these serious changes to asylum law and immigration policy."
Calvo and Lungren also sparred over how much the driver's licensing provisions would cost.
Lungren pointed to a $100 million estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.
But Calvo said the real amount is more likely to be between $500 million and $700 million when the cost of such items as new equipment to tap into national databases is included.
Tim Sparapani, ACLU legislative counsel, said the Real ID Act's rules would result in a de facto national identification card because it would require states to pool driver data in a national database.
"When you condition travel on an identification card and create an internal registry of citizens and a way to track them, that is entirely contrary to most Americans' understandings of the way their country works and should work," Sparapani said.
(BEGIN ITAL)Recommendation: Secure identification should begin in the United States.
The federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification, such as drivers licenses.
(END ITAL) The 9/11 Commission Report, quoted above, is clear.
Creating a nationwide secure system of identification is an important national security issue.
This is not the first time Congress has been told that a secure national identification system was needed to cure one problem or another.
Congress may pass a bill or two this year that nods in the direction of a national identification system.
Unfortunately, it likely will take another commission report before lawmakers get behind a nationwide identity program.
In 1995, the bipartisan Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, concluded that immigration laws and employer sanctions could never be enforced without some form of secure national ID cards and with an accompanying database of citizens and others who are in the country legally.
Congress long has ignored notices that the United States needs a standardized method to be able to identify and track people who commit crimes in one state and easily take up residence and new identities in another state.
Not only do criminals often avoid justice because of a lack of standardized identification, citizens also avoid court orders for child support, custody laws and many other situations simply by skipping out to another state.
Meanwhile, voter fraud could be reduced with secure national IDs.
In recent years, identity theft has become a burgeoning criminal industry thanks to the lack of a nationwide secure system of identification.
Such a system could help curb identity theft.
Another documented national growth industry involves easily obtained fake identification papers.
These inexpensive identity papers can include bogus Social Security cards, birth certificates, check cashing cards and driver's licenses all available in most cities on both sides of the U.S. Mexico border.
The 9/11 Commission Report called for a secure, standardized national identification system as a way to reduce the threat of terrorism and improve homeland security.
That's a valid consideration, of course, since national security must always be at the top of the list of national priorities.
Terrorism and homeland security issues aside, however, the principle of the rule of law erodes in the United States when the government fails to enforce the law that prohibits U.S. employers from hiring workers who are illegally inside the United States.
This was the conclusion of the Jordan commission report on immigration reform.
Without a standardized, secure national system capable of telling citizen from noncitizen, U.S. employers routinely are let off the hook when job applicants show them any number of easily obtained fake identity papers or valid identity cards that offer no proof of citizenship.
The Real ID Act (H.R. 418), which Congress likely will pass this year, requires states to verify the legal residency of driver's license applicants under threat of having the state's licenses banned for such federal uses such as boarding airplanes or cashing checks.
The act includes standardization, which is good.
Problems with this approach include yet another unfunded federal mandate, not to mention a shift in immigration responsibility to state agencies that aren't trained or equipped for the duty.
Another proposal that could pass Congress this year calls for the Social Security Administration to replace all current paper Social Security cards with plastic cards that include a digitized photo with an "encrypted machine readable electronic identification strip."
Congress recognizes the problem.
That's a start.
It should bite the bullet and pass a federal national ID system.

Immigrant rights groups on Wednesday attacked the Senate's passage of new driver's license rules aimed at preventing terrorism, saying they won't secure the nation and reflect surging hostility toward the foreign born in the United States.
"This is clearly an anti immigrant bill that's going to have a very harmful impact on the Latino community and all immigrant communities," said Michele Waslin, director of immigration policy research at the National Council of La Raza.
"It doesn't make us one iota safer.
Not a single immigrant is going to be returned to his or her home country if they're denied a driver's license."
The REAL ID Act would require states to verify that people who apply for a driver's license are in the country legally.
It would also make it harder for immigrants to gain amnesty, and easier to override environmental laws to build a barrier along the Mexican border in California.
The provision was folded into an emergency military spending bill that earmarks $82 billion (euro63.65 billion) for the war in Iraq.
It was approved by the House last week and now goes to President George W. Bush, who is expected to sign it.
Immigrants' advocates say the measure is the latest example of America's increasingly hostile climate toward foreign born residents, an atmosphere dramatically worsened by the terror attacks of Sept 11, 2001, and continually fueled by the ongoing war in Iraq.
"America is a country of paradoxes: We are a country of immigrants, yet we attack immigrants," said Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Council on Civil Rights, a coalition group in Washington, D.C. that in March sent a petition signed by 64 member organizations calling on legislators to vote against the act. "The REAL ID Act is the most blatant attack on immigrant rights since the last major overhaul of immigration law in 1996," he said.
Henderson and other advocates said the more than 10 million undocumented immigrants already in the country with more arriving monthly demonstrate the pressing need for comprehensive immigration reform.
Such changes are being drafted by several senators and are expected to include a proposed guest worker program that would allow immigrants already in the United States to work legally.
"Rather than spending our time diddling about with issues of who's going to drive and who's not going to drive in this country, we should address the whole question of immigration reform," said Cesar Perales, president of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, based in New York.
Opponents also complained that the immigration measures were combined with an emergency measure for military spending, forcing a rushed vote with no Senate hearings amid heavy political pressure.
"This wasn't vetted, and it was attached to this political must pass bill," said Christine Gleichert, legislative director for the American Arab Anti Discrimination Committee.
"We know senators and members of Congress can't and won't vote against funding for our troops, but this provision should not have been attached to it.
They sold it as part of national security."
All but one of the 19 hijackers in the Sept 11 attacks had some form of U.S. identification, some of it fraudulent, the Sept 11 commission found.
The commission recommended the federal government set standards for birth certificates and other identification documents, including driver's licenses.
Congress created a panel to negotiate new driver's license standards, but the new rules supersede the panel.
Advocates say the new measure could actually backfire because many undocumented immigrants' personal information will no longer be kept in state databases, making it much harder to track them.
They also say that, with fewer licensed drivers, they expect an increase in drivers who lack auto insurance.
Some states have voiced opposition to the REAL ID Act, and there are early signs that some may refuse to implement it for lack of funding, among other issues.
The measure gives them three years to meet the new standards.
In addition, state legislators and courts have already begun to craft their own rules on the issue.
In Utah and Tennessee, new laws mandate that undocumented immigrants turn over their driver's licenses and get new driving cards, which are not valid as official identification and cannot be used to board a plane.
On Tuesday, a state judge in New York ruled that the Department of Motor Vehicles may not deny licenses to those who cannot prove they are citizens.
State officials plan to appeal.
"In the short term, there will be lots of confusion," Henderson said.
"There was a broad coalition of groups that opposed the REAL ID Act ,and they'll continue to look at implementation.
Our view is that provisions of this law will prove largely unattainable."
Same day driver's licenses could become a thing of the past under legislation near final approval in Congress, the National Conference of State Legislators said Tuesday.
The measure, which restricts illegal immigrants from getting driver's licenses and tightens U.S. asylum laws, was approved by House and Senate negotiators Tuesday.
It is part of an $82 billion emergency spending bill to fund military operations and rebuilding efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as tsunami relief efforts in Asia.
It is expected to pass the House within days and the Senate next week.
Cheye Calvo, director of the Transportation Committee of the National Conference of State Legislators said the driver's license measure would cause chaos and backlogs in thousands of department of motor vehicle offices across the country, making the nation less secure.
"I don't think Congress really knows what they are mandating," he said.
"This bill imposes significant new burdens that will affect all Americans, anyone who has to go to the DMV is affected by this bill."
Some state DMV offices showed a lower level of concern about the legislation, saying that they already comply with many of the provisions, but that implementaion of the entire proposal could be time consuming and costly.
Proponents of the measure, dubbed the REAL ID Act, dismissed Calvo's predictions as exaggerations from a special interest group and say that the bill would stop foreign terrorists from obtaining driver's licenses that they could use to travel in the United States.
Jeff Lungren, a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee, which spearheaded the REAL ID Act, said that the states that will be most affected are the ones doing poorly in verifying identification documents, including nine "problem" states Wisconsin, Oregon, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Washington, Hawaii and Montana.
If the states refuse to comply with the new law, they "will become even more of a haven for terrorists and illegal aliens to get their driver's licenses," he said.
The bill would require people applying for or renewing driver's licenses to confirm their legal status in the United States.
The residents of states that don't comply won't be allowed to use the driver's licenses as identification to board planes or apply for Social Security and other federal benefits.
Calvo said that language currently in the bill would require states to verify the authenticity of each identification document including birth certificates and utility bills, with the original sources.
This would require states, within three years, to upgrade 3000 departments of motor vehicle offices, train workers, and add employees to handle all the extra phone calls to utility companies, immigration offices, and 30000 vital records offices, some of which are small and don't have any full time employees, he said.
The National Conference of State Legislators has estimated that this effort would cost $500 million.
"State budgets, in many cases, are already in dire straits.
And without federal funding to accompany the federal requirements, some of the provisions will be difficult, if not impossible, for state motor vehicle administrators to implement," said Jason King, public affairs director with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators.
Lundgren said that the estimates are not based on fact and that the Congressional Budget Office estimated the effort would cost $100 million in five years.
(Begin optional ad) Susan Sports, public information officer with the Georgia Department of Motor Vehicle Safety, said that the state already verifies legal U.S. residency and Georgia residency and that employees are trained to spot fake documents.
"We have a very secure Georgia driver's license to begin with," she said.
Georgia does not, however, verify each birth certificate with the original source, instead relying on the certification on each document, she said.
Such a process could take time and states would hope for federal funding to help, Sports said.
It took about a year to implement a real time verification system for Social Security numbers, she added.
Tom Vinger, spokesman with the Texas Department of Public Safety, said that the department was monitoring the REAL ID legislation "with great interest," but he didn't want to comment until a final bill was passed.
"We're not really sure what's going to come out and how it's going to affect us," he said.
"If it passes, obviously, it's going to change they way we do business, exactly how is yet to be determined."
Frank Panela, spokesman for the Florida Department of Highway Safety & Motor Vehicles, said that Florida has no problem with the REAL ID Act, because the state already implements most of the new rules.
"We are already way ahead of the game," he said.
Florida has a document identification system for Social Security cards, passports, immigration documents and other documents that have certain security features.
Fred Stratmann, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Motor Vehicles, said that the state would have "minor implementation issues" to comply with the new measure, including upgrading computers to store digital copies of identification documents.
"Ohio is in very good shape in implementing what the law requires," he said.
(End optional ad) Opponents of the legislation also say that it could push more Americans to obtain passports for identification, if states can't comply with the difficult mandates.
First time passports for adults could cost as much as $97, including security fees.
The Real ID Act was added to the spending bill in the House in an effort spearheaded by Rep James Sensenbrenner, R Wis., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
The Senate version did not include the immigration provisions.

Immigration reform is back on the table with a vengeance.
Last month, House Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner succeeded in attaching his Real ID Act to a must pass Iraq appropriations bill.
Now that spending measure is coming up in the Senate, and though it's unclear how the upper chamber will handle the congressman's proposal, members are girding for an all out fight over immigration.
The Sensenbrenner legislation, tagged as a security measure, is a hodgepodge of provisions: one aimed at finishing a few miles of fence on the border near Tijuana, another raising barriers to asylum seekers who claim they are fleeing abuse in their home countries.
But the section likely to create the most controversy would make it more difficult for states to issue driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.
Already under attack from both the right and the left, it has also provoked calls for still tougher measures, including a national ID card.
The bill's history in the House, where it passed on a 261 161 vote, holds crucial lessons for to them.
And we will not put an end to the illegal influx until we find a way to prevent employers from hiring unauthorized workers.
The unavoidable answer albeit deeply unpopular in this country is a credible "employer verification" system: one that replaces existing fraud prone employment practices with a better way of ensuring that businesses hire only legal residents.
And even some policymakers who favor a temporary worker program are beginning to think this might require some sort of employee ID.
Most Americans detest that idea, to put it mildly.
We relish our privacy, we bristle at government interference in business and obviously any effort to prevent hiring one kind of worker will mean monitoring all hiring.
Though the idea of creating national databases has grown more acceptable since 9/11, the mere mention of worker ID cards is still enough, in most circles, to end all discussion of an employment based strategy.
It's hardly surprising that the last time we tried an employer based approach penalties against businesses that hire illegal workers are part of the landmark Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) that Congress passed in 1986 it was so watered down as to be all but irrelevant.
Still, unappealing as it may sound, an employer verification system is e currently allowed): updated Social Securit y cards, driver's licenses, temporary worker's visas and green cards.
But any employee need produce only one.
The cards would have to have photos.
Ideally, the Department of Homeland Security would coordinate with the Social Security Administration so that the only other information required would be a Social Security number, which in the future could be embedded in all four types of cards.
As with credit card verification, responses would have to come in real time, and employers would learn only one thing about employees: whether they are authorized to work or not.
Existing databases would have to be vastly improved: The 10 year old pilot program that some businesses already use to verify workers' identities still produces far too many false hits, though the number is declining.
As with credit histories, employees who were denied work would have access to their records and an easy to use appeals process.
Equally important, the new system must be phased in over time.
We might start with temporary workers only, or with one sector say, agriculture.
Companies especially small companies that wished to continue with the current paper based method would be permitted to do so.
Any expansion of the program would be tied to proof that it was working well.
And of course it would hardly make sense except in the context of immigration reform that provided U.S. industries reliant on foreign laborers with enough legal workers to function and grow.
None of this will be easy, and the public is right to be skeptical.
But in the long run, if it's done properly, a program of this kind would benefit everyone.
Employers would get the workers they need with much less trouble the current paper based system is notoriously cumbersome and more peace of mind.
Authorized immigrants would welcome a card they could rely on, and they would face less discrimination than they are currently exposed to.
As for American workers, we would have no less privacy than we have now.
We already provide this information when we get hired for a new job.
The only difference under the new system is that it would happen electronically.
As it is, most Americans defy the law every day, many of us several times, benefiting one way or another from the work of illegal immigrants.
We all say this is unacceptable, we say we want change.
But ending the illegality is going to take more than a few miles of new fence.
Do we want a working system, economically realistic but also airtight?
Are we prepared to do what it takes to secure our borders and restore the rule of law?
Think about it think about both the costs and the benefits the next time you use your credit card.

Applicants for state issued driver's licenses in the United States will be required to produce four types of identification when the Congress approves a plan to discourage illegal immigration, the USA Today newspaper reported Thursday.
Most who apply for new licenses and presumably, those seeking renewals would have to prove that they are in the United States legally, possess document of their social security number and home address and show a photo ID.
Motor vehicle department employees then would have to verify the documents with federal databases, a potentially lengthy process that could mean an end to same day license renewals.
Each year, about 70 million people in the United States apply for new driver's licenses or renewals.
In most of the states now, the new drivers are typically required to produce proof of age and one or two other forms of ID, usually including a photo.
Less is required for those renewing licenses, and a few states, including Maryland, allow renewals by mail.
The House is likely to pass the Real ID Act as early as Thursday and the Senate next week, as an attachment to an 81 billion dollar emergency spending bill to the military in Iraq and Afghanistan.
If states did not comply within three years, their driver's licenses could not be used as ID to board a plane or to enter certain federal buildings.
Along with extra security at airports and workplaces, the act could represent the most significant differences in daily lives to stem from post Sept 11 security concerns, according to the report.
A MISTAKEN ID BILL CONGRESS IS in danger of passing legislation that could damage immigration policy under the false pretense of enhancing national security.
The Senate should block this ill conceived proposal and take a more measured look at immigration reform.
House Republican James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin says his bill, the Real ID Act, will keep terrorists from crossing US borders.
In a January column he writes: "The goal of the Real ID Act is straightforward: it seeks to prevent another 9/11 type attack by disrupting terrorist travel."
But the rhetoric promises more protection than the bill delivers.
A key feature of the bill is the denial of driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.
But most of the illegal immigrants who get licenses in the nine states that grant them are trying to earn a living, not commit terrorist acts.
The real challenge is figuring out how to manage undocumented drivers.
Mass deportation is unlikely because many of these drivers are essential to America's economy.
They are vital in various industries, including the business of getting food into grocery stores.
Sensenbrenner's bill would compel states to add security features to all driver's licenses and create a license database that other states could access.
This would essentially create a national ID card, an idea that should be thoroughly debated on its own, not slipped through a back door.
If it passes, the Real ID Act could cause delays in motor vehicle registry offices as states scramble to meet the new requirements.
Residents of states that fail to comply could find that their licenses are useless as IDs at airports, grounding people unless they have passports to use as identification.
The Real ID Act would also demand more proof from asylum seekers.
Government officials could ask for "corroborating evidence."
This is overkill.
Many victims of torture and abuse are unlikely to be able to provide such evidence, especially if they come from countries where law enforcement officials are blind to, or complicit in, abuses.
Sensenbrenner calls for more barriers and surveillance technology along the southern US border.
Illegal immigration should be discouraged.
But this bill ignores the real need for laws that let immigrant workers travel safely and legally between the United States and Mexico.
Sensenbrenner introduced the Real ID Act in January.
Last month the House attached the act to an emergency spending bill for Iraq and other needs, forcing the Senate to consider it.
House and Senate conferees are meeting now to reconcile their versions of the spending bill.
They should leave the Real ID Act on the cutting room floor.
It offers false security instead of intelligent reform.
New driver's license rules tucked in a military spending bill will create national identification cards for Americans and stick state governments with the bill, Republican Sen Lamar Alexander said.
Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, joined Democrats and state officials in railing against the White House backed driver's license rules and other immigration measures before the Senate approved the $82 billion (euro63.79 billion) spending bill 100 0.
The House approved it last week.
Several states fear the new rules will be costly, provide little protection against invasions of privacy and identity theft, and make getting a driver's license a bigger headache for Americans.
The rules are aimed at stopping illegal immigrants from getting driver's licenses to prevent them from boarding planes or entering protected federal buildings.
States will have three years to meet the new standards that include verifying applicants are American citizens or legal residents.
The House had included the rules and other the immigration provisions in its version of the bill paying for the U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The Senate did not, but negotiators included them in the final bill.
Alexander and other lawmakers said the rules established in the REAL ID Act will have unintended consequences.
Driver's license examiners trained to decide whether a person can parallel park will have to determine whether an applicant is an al Qaida terrorist, he said.
"It's possible that some governor may look at this and say, 'Wait a minute.
Who are these people in Washington telling us what to do with our driver's licenses and making us pay for them, too?'"
Alexander said.
Some states have threatened to challenge the new driver's license orders in court and even disobey them.
Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, vice chairman of the National Governors Association, has said "if more than half of the governors agree we're not going down without a fight on this, Congress will have to consider changing" the rules.
Huckabee also is a Republican.
"If you think a trip to the division of motor vehicle is a bad experience today, wait until the REAL ID takes effect," Sen Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said.
All but one of the 19 hijackers in the Sept 11, 2001, attacks had some form of U.S. identification, some of it fraudulent, the Sept 11 commission found.
The commission recommended the federal government set standards for birth certificates and other identification documents, including driver's licenses.
Congress created a panel to negotiate new driver's license standards, but the new rules supersede the panel.
The new rules were written by Rep James Sensenbrenner, House Judiciary Committee chairman, who failed in attempts to include similar provisions in an intelligence reorganization bill signed by President George W. Bush last year.
He was promised he could add them to the first bill guaranteed to get congressional approval.
Sensenbrenner's spokesman Jeff Lungren said the rules do not create a national ID card but are "merely settings standards for the states" and building on states' ongoing efforts to boost driver's license security.
The bill allows the Homeland Security secretary to provide grants to states to help defray costs, but it includes no money for them.
Lungren said that will be addressed in appropriations bills.
A bill that would enact hotly contested immigration rules, including one that would bar illegal immigrants from getting driver's licenses, is marching toward approval with the backing of the White House.
The provisions are attached to an emergency spending bill that would provide $81 billion for military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
A bipartisan House Senate conference committee is expected to agree on a compromise version of the bill today, each chamber is slated to vote on the measure within the next two weeks and then send it to President Bush for his signature.
The immigration provisions, which were introduced as the Real ID Act in January, include new identification requirements for people seeking driver's licenses, toughened standards for immigrants seeking asylum in the United States, and money to complete a three mile stretch of border fencing near San Diego.
The House version contains the immigration provisions but the Senate's version does not.
Lawmakers from both parties, as well as civil liberties groups and immigration advocates, decry the addition of the provisions to the must pass supplemental bill.
Supporters of the provisions know that it would be politically unwise for anyone to vote against a bill that sends money to American soldiers.
Furthermore, high level lobbying by the Real ID measures' author, Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep James Sensenbrenner, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and the White House helped silence discussion of handling the provisions as separate legislation.
In a letter to Congress dated Monday, Joshua Bolten, director of the Office of Management and Budget, strongly encouraged Congress to include the immigration provisions and said the legislation would "strengthen the ability of the United States to protect against terrorist entry into and activities within the United States."
Some experts say the president's support for the tough immigration provisions sends mixed messages.
He also is pushing a temporary guest worker program to make it easier for illegal immigrants to work in the United States and is working hard to improve U.S. Mexico relations.
"We think that the long term future of North America is more ties between communities, but when we see fences going up, it seems to send the wrong message," said Nestor Rodriguez, co director of the Center for Immigration Research at the University of Houston.
Some lawmakers, including Houston Republican Rep John Culberson, a staunch advocate of stronger immigration controls, are completely dedicated to making sure the provisions remain in the bill.
"Stopping the flood of illegal immigrants and protecting our borders is my single highest legislative priority," Culberson said.
"We need action now, and the only sure way to enact immigration change is to attach it to an emergency spending bill."
Indeed, Culberson said he and his allies in the House would vote against the military spending bill if the immigration provisions are removed.
"We would bring it down if we need to," he said.
"I would in two heartbeats.
I am fed up with the complete lack of enforcement of our immigration laws."
The bill would set national standards compelling states to issue driver's licenses only to those lawfully in the country.
Nine states currently allow illegal immigrants to get licenses.
Residents of states that don't comply with the law would not be allowed to use their driver's licenses as federal identification, needed to board commercial aircraft, for example.
The license changes have raised several concerns.
Civil liberties groups worry the move takes the country closer to a national ID card.
Some states feel the changes present a bureaucratic burden and some experts say illegal immigrants will continue to drive, but without insurance.
The provisions also would raise the standard of proof that asylum applicants must meet if they claim that they have been persecuted on ethnic, religious or political grounds in their home countries.
The asylum rules are unnecessary, said Joseph Vail, a former immigration judge and director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Houston Law Center.
"The standards are already extremely high," he said.
"There is not one example of a terrorist having been granted asylum.
The end result will be that qualified asylum seekers will be denied asylum."
The bill would pay for supplies, services, training and facility improvements for U.S. troops overseas and also fund various programs, such as those that buy back weapons from foreign insurgents and counter drug efforts in Afghanistan.
This editorial appeared in Wednesday's Los Angeles Times: In the absence of a national citizen's ID card, which we're not against, we're all for Washington establishing some uniform standards for state issued driver's licenses.
It's too bad, however, that some in the Congress led by House Judiciary Committee Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R Wis. have hijacked this post Sept 11 imperative with their tiresome anti immigrant crusade.
Last month, the House passed Sensenbrenner's Real ID Act, which would prohibit federal agencies from accepting for any official purpose state issued identification cards or driver's licenses that could have been issued without verifying the recipient's immigration status.
Never mind that 11 states, mindful that the main purpose of a license is to certify that someone is capable of driving a vehicle, already offer licenses to illegal immigrants.
Also included in the bill are several unnecessary provisions that would make it more difficult for deserving people to seek asylum in the United States.
The measure is now before the Senate, attached to the supplemental funding bill for the war in Iraq.
The Senate would be wise to strip these "Real ID" provisions from the legislation.
Sensenbrenner claims that this is all about fighting terrorism, but he cannot be serious in thinking that the security of the United States would be guaranteed by requiring al Qaida operatives to prove their legal status before obtaining an American driver's license.
What this congressional measure does guarantee is less safety on the nation's roads, the result of fewer licensed and insured drivers.
Not giving licenses to undocumented workers to drive to work would only make sense in Sensenbrenner's parallel universe, where the United States doesn't rely heavily on imported labor.
Allowing a driver the possibility to apply for a license to drive to work means that person's photograph, address and proof of insurance will be on file at the local DMV.
And that is something to make us all feel safer.
The asylum provisions contemplated in Sensenbrenner's bill would unnecessarily raise the bar for granting asylum to people fleeing persecution.
Although it is true that more than a decade ago the nation's asylum laws were abused, the regulations enacted in 1994 by the Clinton administration clearly restrained any further abuse.
The numbers tell the story: Before 1994, the average number of applicants hovered around 143000 annually, in 2003, there were about 46000.
Sensenbrenner has indicated that he won't consider any immigration legislation if Real ID is not enacted into law.
Neither the Senate nor the president can afford to allow him to establish the terms of this debate.
After a late night debate on the politically sensitive issue of immigration, the California Assembly on Wednesday passed a bill to extend driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.
The measure would clear the way for California to create a distinct driver's license, with a unique design and color, for people who cannot prove legal citizenship in the United States.
The license could be used only for driving and would not be valid identification for other purposes such as opening a bank account or boarding an airplane.
The bill, SB 60 by Democratic Sen Gil Cedillo, would also allow roughly 800000 people in California who have applied to federal immigration officials for legal residency to get a California driver's license starting as soon as March 2006.
The bill passed 42 34.
Cedillo's bill passed the Senate in June on a 22 16 partisan split.
Now the Senate is expected to approve recent amendments and send it to the governor, who is under pressure from Republicans to veto the measure.
Cedillo said he included several elements in the bill aimed at overcoming objections from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who last year vetoed a Cedillo driver's license bill.
But before the state Assembly took up the new bill Wednesday, there were no indications that the changes would satisfy the governor.
The governor's office has consistently said Schwarzenegger does not want to take any action until the federal government finishes deciding its requirements for state licenses changes spawned by concern that terrorists or other criminals could get such documents.
Congress gave states the option to create distinct driver's licenses for illegal immigrants under the Real ID Act passed in May.
That sweeping law will require most states to change the information they include on driver's licenses, the documents they require to issue a license and how they store driver's license data.
Before adopting their own new laws, most states are waiting to see what regulations the federal Department of Homeland Security issues to implement the Real ID Act.
Those regulations are expected next year.
On the Assembly floor, Democrats argued that the bill would improve highway safety in California by ensuring that most drivers are licensed, trained and insured.
"This is a good bill because I believe it's the right thing to do because individuals are here and they're driving and that's the reality," said Democratic Assemblyman Jerome Horton.
Republicans argued that the bill would reward people for breaking the law.
Assemblyman Doug La Malfa asked how he could teach his children to follow rules "when the California state Legislature is making rules that cause people to not have to obey the law."
But the 90 minute debate focused less on the details of the bill than on the politically sensitive issue of immigration.
"Illegal immigration is an enormous cost to this state," said Republican Assemblyman Mark Wyland.
"And what this does is propose to legitimize that."
Democratic Assemblyman Alberto Torrico argued that undocumented workers, through taxes taken from their wages, "put in more than they're taking out."
"The reward is not the driver's license," he said.
"People come to this country because of the jobs and the economic opportunity and to get what every one of us wants for our children ,a better life."
About 9500 Burmese refugees scheduled to be resettled from Thailand to the United States this year are in limbo because their indirect support for armed rebels opposed to their repressive government has put them in technical violation of American anti terrorism law, government officials say.
The Burmese are the largest of several groups, including refugees from Cuba, Vietnam, Liberia and Somalia, whose admission to the United States has been jeopardized by a provision in the USA Patriot Act that denies entry to anyone who has provided material support to a terrorist or armed rebel group.
The provision applies even if that support was coerced or the aims of the group in question match those of American foreign policy.
The law broadens the definition of terrorist groups to include organizations that do not appear on the State Department's list of designated terrorist groups, effectively barring refugees loosely linked to armed groups that have resisted authoritarian governments like those in Burma and Cuba.
Some of the refugees paid taxes to rebel groups that controlled their communities.
Others offered food or small sums to relatives or acquaintances in groups with ties to rebels or were forced to provide such support, refugee resettlement officials say.
Homeland Security and State Department officials have been working for several months to define guidelines for a waiver to the statute that would allow the resettlement of the refugees, who are fleeing religious, ethnic and political persecution, and refugee officials said they were hoping for a resolution soon.
But with thousands of families stranded in refugee camps overseas, officials from the United Nations and Republicans and Democrats in Congress have begun warning in recent weeks that the law is leaving refugees increasingly at risk.
The law has already delayed the resettlement of 146 Cubans who offered support to armed opponents of Fidel Castro in the 1960s, 200 Burmese refugees housed in Malaysia, 30 Hmong refugees in Thailand, 11 Vietnamese Montagnard refugees in Cambodia, and a small number of Liberians and Somalis, U.N. statistics show.
The United Nations is still awaiting a formal decision on the fate of the 9500 Burmese refugees in Thailand.
U.N. officials and members of Congress said the refugees posed no known security risks to the United States.
By tagging them as having links to terrorists, the United Nations says, the Bush administration will make it difficult to find other countries willing to accept them.
It may also lead countries providing the refugees with temporary shelter to reconsider their welcome.
The delay in issuing a waiver to the statute has led the United Nations to suspend the American resettlement of hundreds of Colombian refugees, many of whom were forced to make payments to rebel forces, and of 1300 Burmese refugees housed in Malaysia, who made donations to ethnic groups linked to armed opponents of the Burmese government.
It has also prevented some 500 asylum seekers in the United States from being granted permanent refuge here.
Many of those cases are being appealed.
"Until this issue is resolved, many deserving refugees and applicants for asylum fleeing religious, ethnic or other forms of persecution will be unfairly denied or postponed from achieving safe haven," Reps. Christopher H. Smith, R N.J., and Ileana Ros Lehtinen, R Fla., said in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff last week.
The Patriot Act, which was passed in 2001 and is being reauthorized by Congress, has been increasingly applied to refugees in the past two years.
So has the Real ID Act, which further broadened the definition of terrorist groups when it was passed last year.
"That procedure should ensure that terrorists do not abuse refugee status or the asylum laws of the United States," Smith and Ros Lehtinen wrote.
"However, the procedure should also properly weigh situations in which individuals are acting under duress or are legitimately resisting illegitimate and tyrannical regimes."
Sens Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, both Democrats, wrote a similar letter last week.
Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, said his agency was working with the departments of State and Justice to resolve the problem.
"Part of the consternation over this issue is that this process is taking some time," he said.
"The process is made difficult because of the need to balance national security with our deep commitment to assisting refugees and providing a safe refuge."
Those affected by the law include a Colombian woman forced by rebels to hand over livestock.
The rebels killed her husband and raped her before she escaped the country.
Because her forced support for the rebels would bar her from admission to the United States, the United Nations resettled her in another country.
Researchers from the Human Rights Program at Harvard Law School, who traveled to Thailand and Malaysia, interviewed scores of additional refugees.
Two of them one who gave a hat to a cousin who belonged to an opposition group and another who was taxed a basket of rice annually by the group are among the Burmese who still hope to find refuge here.
Lawyers at the Homeland Security Department have also argued that the laws now bar the United States from admitting Afghan refugees who supported the Northern Alliance in its battle against the Taliban or South Africans who supported the African National Congress when it was deemed a terrorist group.
The lawyers made that case in January as they tried to persuade a panel of judges to deny asylum to a Burmese woman who had donated money to an opposition group.
The woman, a Christian who has been detained in Texas since she entered this country in 2004, said she had been persecuted in Burma for her religious beliefs and her ethnicity.
The woman, who asked for anonymity because her case is pending, is still in detention, awaiting the judges' decision.
"I am still hoping," she said in a telephone interview on Friday.
Sen.
Gil Cedillo, D Los Angeles, and Democratic lawmakers who supported his immigrant driver's license bill are in deep and dangerous denial.
Apparently they missed how Congress preempted states on this issue.
Five months ago Congress approved the Real ID Act to guide states in issuing driver's licenses that the federal government would recognize as valid identification to get on an airplane, apply for Social Security, even enter a post office.
Like it or not, and we don't, Congress has turned the driver's license into a national identity card.
Our Legislature cannot change or contravene federal law.
Cedillo claims his measure conforms with the Real ID Act.
He cannot know that.
The regulations aren't expected to be issued for another year.
So, SB 60 would require California to redesign its driver's licenses to comply with a federal law that has no regulations yet for implementing it.
The California Department of Motor Vehicles opposed SB 60 for that reason.
As the DMV wrote to Cedillo, "It would be premature at this juncture to enact California law that directs this department to initiate a secondary license procedure until the (federal) rule making process is concluded."
For those reasons, the governor made it clear he would not sign SB 60.
Serious budgetary issues justify that decision as well.
It would cost California millions to create a new driver's license procedure two years ahead of what the federal law allows, and in the end the regulations would almost certainly invalidate those efforts.
We sympathize with Cedillo's goal.
Driver's licenses ought to validate people's ability to drive competently, not their immigration status.
Without a valid driver's license, undocumented immigrants cannot register cars or buy auto insurance.
But they still drive, and that means the ranks of unlicensed and uninsured drivers in California and nationwide have swelled.
But Cedillo and his supporters in the Legislature can't override the federal law.
The fight belongs in Congress.
An anti terrorism law creating a national standard for all driver's licenses by 2008 isn't just upsetting civil libertarians and immigration rights activists.
State motor vehicle officials nationwide who will have to carry out the Real ID Act say its authors grossly underestimated its logistical, technological and financial demands.
In a comprehensive survey obtained by The Associated Press and in follow up interviews, officials cast doubt on the states' ability to comply with the law on time and fretted that it will be a budget buster.
"It is just flat out impossible and unrealistic to meet the prescriptive provisions of this law by 2008," Betty Serian, a deputy secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, said in an interview.
Nebraska's motor vehicles director, responding to the survey by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, said that to comply with Real ID her state "may have to consider extreme measures and possibly a complete reorganization."
And a new record sharing provision of Real ID was described by an Illinois official as "a nightmare for all states."
States use a hodgepodge of systems and standards in granting driver's licenses and identification cards.
In some places, a high school yearbook may be enough to prove identity.
A major goal of Real ID which was motivated by the Sept 11, 2001 attacks, whose perpetrators had legitimate driver's licenses is to unify the disparate licensing rules and make it harder to fraudulently obtain a card.
The law also demands that states link their record keeping systems to national databases so duplicate applications can be detected, illegal immigrants caught and driving histories shared.
State licenses that fail to meet Real ID's standards will not be able to be used to board an airplane or enter a federal building.
The law, which was attached to a funding measure for the Iraq war last May, has been criticized by civil libertarians who contend it will create a de facto national ID card and new centralized databases, inhibiting privacy.
State organizations such as the National Governors Association have blasted the law as well.
Many states will have to amend laws in order to comply.
The August survey by the motor vehicle administrators' group, which has not been made public, asked licensing officials nationwide for detailed reports on what it will take to meet Real ID's demands.
"If you begin to look at the full ramifications of this, we are talking about billions and billions of dollars.
Congress simply passed an unfunded mandate," said Barry Steinhardt, director of the technology and liberty project at the American Civil Liberties Union.
"Every motorist in America is going to pay the price of this, of the Congress' failure to do a serious exploration of the cost, the complexity, of the difficulty."
The survey described a multitude of hurdles.
Some examples: The law demands that states mine multiple databases to check the accuracy of documents submitted by license applicants.
Several states questioned how that will work, especially with confirming birth certificates.
Some states' ancient computing systems will have to be overhauled in order to link to other networks.
Minnesota runs a 1980s era mainframe system.
Many states don't make drivers prove they are legally in the country, but the law will now demand such documentation.
It also calls for states to run license applications through a federal database known as SAVE that was launched by a 1986 law aimed at preventing illegal immigrants from receiving federal benefits.
One problem, though, is that the "SAVE database is notoriously unreliable ,months behind," said South Carolina's response to the survey.
Real ID requires that a license show someone's principal residence.
But state officials object that a mailing address makes more sense for many people for "snowbirds" who spend time in two states, for example or for public officials who want to protect their privacy.
The law calls for a person's "full legal name," no nickname or abbreviations, on licenses.
Cards have to be redesigned and databases must be reprogrammed to make room for extremely long names, likely up to 125 characters.
That's not an easy process.
Real ID demands that all driver's licenses or ID cards have pictures that can be read by facial recognition technology.
That would end many states' practice of letting people with certain religious beliefs request not to have a picture.
"If you take any one of these things individually, you see a significant problem," Steinhardt said.
"There are literally hundreds of these problems embedded in Real ID, and the statute doesn't give you a way out.
It's black and white.
No exceptions, no reality check.
"In many respects it's a statute that ignores reality."
Mexican President Vicente Fox on Friday condemned the intensification of anti immigrant measures adopted by the United States, including the construction of a wall along the common border.
Fox, whose country is one of the main sources of illegal migration to the United States, said in a statement that "walls are useless."
Fox said that in cases of violence, the Mexican Foreign Ministry will reinforce the denunciations in international fora on violations of human rights of Mexicans in the United States.
US President George W. Bush issued the Real ID Act, which restricts asylum, bans the issuing of drivers licenses to illegal aliens and plans the construction of a wall in southwest United States, along with the Mexican border.
The nation's governors told Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, on Monday that the new law expanding the role of state motor vehicle departments to include national security responsibilities was presenting enormous financial and logistical challenges that could take many years to meet.
Some governors suggested that the problems might prove so onerous that Congress might need another approach.
The law, known as the Real ID Act, gives states three years to begin verifying whether someone seeking or renewing a driver's license is in the country legally.
"Real ID has raised a lot of concerns," said Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee, a Democrat who was part of a bipartisan chorus of criticism made by the governors to reporters after the meeting.
"People who pass these laws don't necessarily take into account what it takes to implement them in the states.
Some people expressed the opinion that if you want to have a national ID card, fine.
You need to issue it, not try to get it done in 50 states."
The governors met privately with Chertoff on the final day of the National Governors Association's summer meetings.
Chertoff, speaking to reporters after his 40 minute meeting, described it as part of "an ongoing discussion" with the governors about how to put new programs into practice and to improve existing ones.
"Everybody's opinion is different," he said.
"We'll find a common plan to work for everybody."
While the governors said they appreciated Chertoff's words, many seemed nonetheless daunted by the need to restructure motor vehicle agencies.
Under the new law, workers would need to be trained for added responsibilities that involved document verification and use of sensitive federal databases.
Many governors were critical of how the law was forced on them with no consultation.
Congress approved the measure in May as part of a bill providing $82 billion more for the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"It was attached at the last minute, and it was poorly thought through," said Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a Republican who became the new chairman of the governors association.
Part of the governors' objection was based on costs.
Congress appropriated $100 million for the effort, but Gov. Mark Warner of Virginia, a Democrat and the outgoing chairman, said upgrading the motor vehicle department in his state alone could cost that much.
In a rebuff to California officials and environmentalists, the Bush administration cleared the way Wednesday for completion of a 14 mile long border fence that will run through coastal wetlands to the Pacific Ocean near San Diego.
Exercising the first waiver of environmental laws since Congress in May gave him the authority to do so, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said that completing the last 3 1/2 miles of the fence at a cost of about $32 million would allow the U.S. Border Patrol to create a security corridor between it and the existing border fence.
The zone would include two new fences and two new roads for use by border agents, plus stadium style lighting and surveillance cameras.
In the process, said Border Patrol Chief David Aguilar, the agency would be able to shrink the area agents need to physically patrol from 2000 acres to 200 acres.
"Bottom line, this is about border security," Aguilar told reporters.
"We're addressing the vulnerabilities here" in closing a border to potential terrorists.
Compressing the amount of territory the government patrols, he said, also will deter illegal immigration by creating "certainty of arrest in that zone."
The Border Patrol chief pledged that his agents would be "good stewards of the environment," and he blamed much of the area's degradation on traffic from border crossers who take cover in the wetlands and litter the area with trash.
With Chertoff's announcement, the department formally waived enforcement of environmental and other laws that had delayed the project or threatened to.
In a statement issued by his office, Chertoff promised to "act in an environmentally responsible manner consistent with the security needs of our nation."
But environmentalists who fought the project say the government is planning to use soil from a nearby mesa to fill in a canyon, nicknamed Smugglers Gulch, with enough dirt to fill two Hoover Dams.
They believe it will trigger severe ecological hardships.
"This will cause a tremendous amount of damage to the Tijuana estuary, particularly downstream," said Jim Peugh, chairman of the conservation committee for the San Diego Audubon Society.
"The waiver means they don't have to respect water quality or endangered species or labor or child safety laws.
It's a very chilling precedent."
Federal officials have come to San Diego and "talked, but they don't listen," Peugh said.
He argued that the border could be protected "without cutting off the tops of the mesas to fill in the canyon.
The problem is they insist on a straight freeway across the canyons.
They have chosen to do it in an environmentally damaging way."
Litigation has dogged the project since Congress approved the border fence in 1996.
Last year, the California Coastal Commission which regulates coastline development refused to grant permits to complete the fence, saying the harm to sensitive habitats outweighed security benefits.
Peter Douglas, the commission's executive director, said Wednesday's federal action trumped state law.
"This is a clear victory for the politics of fear," he said.
"They were intent on circumventing all the environmental protections we spent decades putting into place.
They were able to get through the back door what they couldn't get through the front.
And there's nothing we can do about it except mourn the day."
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has called for a balanced approach in completing a border infrastructure system that weighs both environmental and security considerations.
"The federal government appears to have gone to great lengths to allay and avoid environmental concerns, including public hearings and numerous studies, and Californians appreciate that," Schwarzenegger's office said in a statement Wednesday.
Outraged by what they saw as obstructionism by environmentalists, congressional Republicans passed the Real ID Act in May, giving the Homeland Security secretary authority to waive any legal requirements that he, in his discretion, "determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction" of barriers, like border fences, under his jurisdiction.
Hailing Chertoff's move Wednesday, Rep Duncan Hunter, R Calif., castigated "the dilatory efforts which have restricted this national security element for so many years."
Rep F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R Wis., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, likewise decried those who "stymied (the project) by litigation and obstructionism."
The majority of Californians support a guest worker program for illegal immigrants and do not believe that they are taking jobs from the state's residents, according to a statewide poll released Thursday.
In addition, those surveyed hold a more positive view of illegal immigrants than in previous years, the nonpartisan Field Poll reported.
Last month, 47 percent of those surveyed said they believe that undocumented immigrants are having a "favorable impact" on the state, compared to 19 percent in 1982.
Voters and nonvoters, however, hold dramatically different views on the subject.
About 36 percent of voters said they believe illegal immigrants have a favorable impact on the state, compared to 64 percent of nonvoters.
The poll comes a week after the U.S. Senate began debating a series of immigration reforms.
The House passed legislation in December that emphasized employer sanctions and tighter enforcement along the border.
The Republican Party also has endorsed a guest worker program, which President Bush has said needs to be a central part of immigration reform.
The Field Poll reported that 65 percent of people surveyed last month said they supported a temporary worker program, which would provide legal status for undocumented laborers.
And 70 percent said they believed illegal immigrants are generally doing jobs others don't want.
Poll director Mark DiCamillo said Thursday's poll results reflect the increasing population of noncitizens in the state.
"The demographics of California now are very different than the demographics of California 20 years ago," DiCamillo said.
California's improving economy and low unemployment also were factors in the survey results, he said.
According to the poll, public attitudes toward undocumented immigrants obtaining drivers' licenses are also changing.
Of those surveyed, 44 percent said they believe illegal immigrants should be able to get licenses, compared to 35 percent one year ago.
But again, there are stark differences between those who are registered to vote and those who are not.
Only 33 percentof voters support licenses, compared to 61 percent of nonvoters.
The federal Real ID Act signed into law on May 11 last year required states to replace current drivers' licenses with forgery proof identification cards by 2008, but Congress gave states the option to create distinct licenses for illegal immigrants.
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed such a bill last year.
The poll was based on a random telephone survey of 500 California adults conducted in both English and Spanish over a two week period in February, according to the director.
The sample included 337 registered voters and 163 who were not registered to vote.
The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.
At a hearing in the state Senate last week, California legislators got their first close look at how the controversial federal Real ID Act will affect the state budget and ordinary Californians.
It was unsettling.
Approved by Congress last year, the Real ID Act requires states to radically change the way they issue driver's licenses if they want their residents to be able to use that document as valid identification to board airplanes, enter federal buildings, and apply for a federal job, Social Security or any other federal benefit.
State officials who have met with a working group in Washington about implementation say the law will likely be phased in over a five year period, beginning in 2008.
That means not all 24 million licensed Californians will have to turn in their driver's licenses at once.
That's a big relief.
Still, applicants seeking their first license in California or trying to get the old one renewed will find the task more difficult and expensive.
At minimum, California will be forced to suspend its convenient renew by mail option that more than 2 million state drivers used last year.
That will mean longer lines at the Department of Motor Vehicles.
Besides presenting a birth certificate, applicants will also have to produce two documents to prove they actually live where they claim.
(Federal regulators are expected to exempt most people born before 1935.)
The state's cost of implementing could go as high as $500 million, with individual license holders expected to pay more, possibly double the current $26 license fee.
When Congress approved the Real ID Act, it was billed as a necessary tool to fight global terrorism.
Whether it does that is an open question.
But it's clear that the new tool won't be cheap or easy to use.
A Canadian judge on Wednesday acquitted two Sikh men accused of murdering 329 people in an Air India jet bombing off the coast of Ireland in 1985.
In a stunning verdict which reduced some relatives of victims in the court to tears, Justice Ian Bruce Josephson threw out eight counts of murder and conspiracy against Ajaib Singh Bagri and Ripudaman Singh Malik.
The judgements came after a 20 year investigation, and a 19 month trial into the world's worst airborne terror strike prior to the attacks of September 11, 2001.
A Canadian judge announced Wednesday that Sikh businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik and sawmill worker Ajaib Singh Bagri were not guilty of conspiracy and murder in the 1985 Air India bombing that killed 329 people.
Justice Ian Bruce Josephson of the British Columbia Supreme Court said he simply did not believe the testimony of witnesses who linked the men to the bombing.
Calling them inconsistent, he said the accounts surfaced too late to be credible.
He did, however, accept the Crown Court's theory that there was a conspiracy to bring down two Air India flights by planting bombs in suitcases that were placed on planes leaving the Vancouver airport.
Bagri and Malik, who had been on trial since April 28, 2003, were charged with first degree murder over the death of 329 people as well as a variety of other charges connected with the bomb that blew up Air India Flight 182 on June 23, 1985.
The flight exploded and crashed off Ireland's Atlantic coast, on its way from Canada to India, via London.
All 329 people on board, mostly Canadians, were killed.
The two men were also accused of causing a separate bombing at Tokyo's Narita airport.
Two baggage handlers died just 54 minutes before Flight 182 exploded when a bomb went off inside a suitcase they were transferring to another Air India plane, Flight 301.
Canada's prosecutors alleged the bombings were an act of vengeance against the government of India following a 1984 raid on the Golden Temple at Amritsar, the holiest shrine for Sikhs.
Twenty years after a bomb on an airliner en route from Toronto to New Delhi blew up off the Irish coast, killing 329 people, a judge on Wednesday acquitted the two Indian born Canadian Sikhs charged in the explosion.
The unexpected end after 19 months of testimony trial leaves the worst case of mass murder in Canadian history and the bloodiest attack on civilian air aviation before Sept 11, 2001, an unsettled mystery.
The decision by a British Columbia Supreme Court judge that the government had not made a conclusive case after two decades of investigations costing more than $80 million represented a rebuke to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canada's federal intelligence agency.
Nearly all the physical evidence was lost 7000 feet below the ocean.
The most credible potential witnesses were either murdered, died of natural causes, or were apparently intimidated from testifying or lied on the stand.
The few important prosecution witnesses, who testified that they had heard the defendants confess, were deemed unreliable and biased by Justice Ian Bruce Josephson.
The judge declared that justice would not be achieved "if persons are convicted on anything less than the requisite standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt."
Prosecutors left open the possibility of an appeal and the police said that they stood by their investigation but that the case remained open.
The only person convicted of any role in the June 23, 1985, explosions has refused to cooperate and several other people suspected in the plot have never been charged.
The two defendants, Ripudaman Singh Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri, were proponents of a separate Sikh state, but they denied involvement in the bombings.
All 329 people on board Air India Flight 182, most of them Canadian Hindus, died in the explosion.
Eighty victims were under 12 years old.
Another bomb, in luggage being transferred between other planes, exploded less than an hour earlier, killing two baggage handlers at Narita Airport in Tokyo.
Josephson said in his verdict that he was convinced both bombs originated from flights that had left Vancouver.
Prosecutors said the bombings were part of terrorist actions in retaliation for the Indian army's 1984 storming of the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Sikhism's holiest shrine in an effort to capture armed Sikh separatists inside.
The suspected mastermind in the bombings, Talwinder Singh Parmar, was killed in 1992 while in Indian police custody.
Another suspect, Hardial Singh Johal, was arrested but died of natural causes in 2002.
The only person punished for the crimes so far is Inderjit Singh Reyat, who was convicted in 1991 of making the Tokyo bomb who was convicted in 2003 for involvement in the other bombing.
His refusal to cooperate with prosecutors was a setback for them.
The trial had a Rip Van Winkle feel to it.
Over the past two years, 115 witnesses described scenes and events that tested their memories and recalled a time when airline security was remarkably lax.
A judge here acquitted two Canadian Sikhs on Wednesday of engineering a plan to put bombs on Air India flights 20 years ago, leaving unanswered who was responsible for Canada's worst mass killing and the largest act of air terrorism before Sept 11, 2001.
Ending a four year case, the judge found that the assortment of former girlfriends, paid informers and fallen out business partners central to the prosecution were not credible enough to convict a millionaire Vancouver businessman and a Sikh activist of murder.
His finding shocked family members of the victims.
"We are devastated that the true perpetrators of this crime are free today," said Ed Madon, who was 8 when his father died aboard the Air India plane brought down in 1985 over the Atlantic Ocean.
"The Canadian justice system has failed us."
The verdict was a blow to government efforts to counter allegations that imported political passions simmering within the country's many immigrant communities could be a source of terrorism.
Prosecutors asserted that angry Sikhs in British Columbia planted the bombs to retaliate against the Indian government's attack on a Sikh temple in Punjab in 1984.
One bomb brought down an Air India Boeing 747, killing all 329 aboard as it neared the coast of Ireland on June 23, 1985.
The second exploded luggage being transferred to an Air India flight at Tokyo's airport, killing two baggage handlers.
In both cases, the bags were loaded onto flights out of Canada that connected to Air India flights.
After years of what victims' families called official neglect, authorities belatedly mounted the most complex and costly investigation in the country's history.
But it failed to crack the secrecy among the immigrant community.
Provincial court Justice Ian Bruce Josephson upheld much of the government's theory of the crimes but ruled that investigators had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt who carried them out.
"We are very disappointed today," said Sgt. John Ward of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
But he said, "We are still investigating this matter.
We will not stop."
Family members said that because of the inconclusive verdict, a public inquiry is now needed as to who carried out the terrorist acts and how the fledgling Canadian Security Intelligence Service failed to pursue the case 20 years ago.
"Only a public inquiry can investigate the failures of the system," said Susheel Gupta, who was 12 when his mother was killed.
"This was murder, pure and simple.
If the murder of 329 people doesn't deserve a public inquiry, what does?"
Investigators had a prime suspect under surveillance before the bombings.
But reports that came out 19 years later showed that they often lost track of the suspect, ended surveillance hours before the bombs were placed, and erased wiretapped conversations that could have led to earlier arrests.
"This sends the message that someone can come into Canada, set bombs on planes and kill people, and get away with it," said Dave Hayer, a provincial legislator.
His father, a Canadian Sikh journalist who condemned the bombings, was assassinated in 1998, reportedly by Sikh radicals.
The bombings were a chilling harbinger of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
In Canada, they provoked similar surprise that foreign conflicts could bring violence to distant, relatively secure countries, and similar postmortem findings that investigators had missed warnings and clues before the attacks.
"It should have been a wake up call," said Reg Whitaker, a political scientist at the University of Victoria.
The Air India bombings were among the first to feature the kinds of threats from small, shadowy radical groups that now face the world, he said.
"In the 1980s, the world was still in the Cold War.
We were still looking for Russian networks," he said.
"Terrorism was not identified as it is now, in terms of an attack on the homeland that could reach into the lives of everyday people."
The case against the two accused, a millionaire businessman named Ripudaman Singh Malik and a preacher and sawmill worker, Ajaib Singh Bagri, took years to build.
In part this was because of official fumbling that the Toronto Globe and Mail newspaper later called "staggering."
The two men were associates of Talwinder Singh Parmar, a Sikh who authorities said led a militant group from his home in Burnaby, B.C.
After India's raid on the Sikhs' holy Golden Temple, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service suspected that Parmar had been involved in a plot to kill Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
They put Parmar under surveillance but repeatedly lost him.
"Anyone in the back seat of a car wearing a beard and turban looks like the next guy," a CSIS agent said in a report that was made public last year.
Agents tailed the wrong cars, and residents called police to complain about not so secret spies loitering near Parmar's house.
As agents argued with one neighbor, their suspect drove away unnoticed.
Family members said Wednesday that those lapses must now be investigated.
"The Canadian justice system has mocked all of us," said John Chatlani, whose mother died in the bombing over the Atlantic.
"Someone needs to be held accountable."
Parmar, who Josephson said was the probable mastermind of the plot, returned to India and was killed in 1992 in what police there said was a confrontation with authorities.
The charges against Malik and Bagri were largely based on comments they allegedly made in the years after the bombings.
A third man, Inderjit Singh Reyat, was sentenced to 10 years in 1991 for buying materials for the Tokyo bomb and five years in 2003 for his role in the bombmaking that brought down Air India Flight 182 off the coast of Ireland.
Geoffrey Gaul, a prosecution spokesman, said government lawyers would see whether there were grounds to appeal Josephson's ruling.
The verdict in the Air India bombing trial in Canada, is unfair but has come too late to matter, some relatives in India of victims of the 1985 bombing said Thursday.
"It's been 20 years now and the world had forgotten the bombing," said Muktaben Bhat, 70 year old mother of Bombay businessman and theatre actor Parag Bhat who was killed in the blast along with his wife Chand and six month old son Siddhant.
"The verdict has come too late, but I am shocked as it is unfair," she told AFP.
Bhat, who had attended some of the hearings of the trial in Vancouver in 2003, said she was convinced the two accused were guilty of the crime and the "not guilty" verdict had stunned her.
Her daughter Manjiri was in the court when the verdict was delivered Wednesday.
"There were small instances and a chain of events that linked the two accused to the crime.
I am shocked and hurt as to how they can be let off," said Bhat.
"The trial was conducted in a bullet proof court room and so much money was spent on it by the Canadian government.
We all knew that the two were guilty.
Anyway what can we say as a lot of time has passed now."
Parag was Bhat's only son and his body was not found.
"My son, his wife and their son had gone for a vacation to Canada.
They never came back.
I have no one to succeed my family as Parag was the only son I had," said Bhat who lost her husband a few years ago after a long illness and now stays alone in suburban Bombay.
The widow of S.S.
Binder, co pilot of the ill fated Air India Flight 182, also felt the verdict had come too late.
"Too much time has passed since the crash," Amarjit Bhinder told the Indian Express newspaper.
Indian born Ajaib Singh Bagri and Ripudaman Singh Malik saw charges against them dismissed after a judge in Vancouver ruled the prosecution in a near two year trial had not proven its case against them beyond reasonable doubt.
The pair were cleared of eight charges each of murder and conspiracy in the bombing of the plane and a blast less than an hour earlier in Tokyo which killed two baggage handlers.
The June 23, 1985 attack in which 329 people died represented the world's worst aviation terror strike prior to September 11, 2001.
Loud gasps rippled through the courtroom packed with about 70 relatives and friends of bombing victims as Justice Ian Bruce Josephson acquitted first Malik and then Bagri.
Sobbing uncontrollably, one woman fled outside, while most of the other relatives sat dazed and broke into tears.
They had waited nearly 20 years for the verdict, and many had travelled to the western Canadian city from India, the United States and throughout Canada hoping for convictions.
After a two year trial, a Canadian judge on Wednesday acquitted two Indian born Sikhs of murder and other charges in the deaths of 331 people killed in the bombings of an Air India plane over the Atlantic and at Tokyo's airport 20 years ago.
British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Ian Josephson said the prosecution's witnesses were not credible.
Josephson found Ripudaman Singh Malik, 58, and Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, not guilty on all eight charges each man faced, including first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
On June 23, 1985, Air India Flight 182 from Montreal to London, carrying luggage and passengers originating in Vancouver, exploded and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Ireland.
All 329 people on board, mostly Canadians, were killed.
An hour earlier, a bomb in baggage intended for another Air India flight exploded in the Tokyo airport, killing two baggage handlers.
Canadian prosecutors claimed that the two explosions were the result of one conspiracy, an act of revenge by Sikh separatists for the 1984 raid by Indian forces on the Golden Temple at Amritsar, the holiest site in their religion.
Ripudaman Singh Malik was found not guilty Wednesday in the deaths of 329 people who perished when Air India Flight 182 was brought down by a bomb 20 years ago in Canada's worst case of mass murder.
Justice Ian Josephson was still to pass judgment on Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, who along with Malik had faced charges of first degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and attempted murder in the downing of Flight 182.
The two men were also charged in an explosion at Japan's Narita airport that killed two baggage handlers on the same day.
About 100 people began lining up outside the B.C. Supreme Court building under tight security and in a steady rain trying to get seats to hear Justice Ian Josephson's verdict.
Venomous demands for justice besieged Canada's government Thursday, after two Sikhs were cleared of killing 329 people in a 1985 Air India jet bombing.
Loved ones of victims, the press and foes of Prime Minister Paul Martin's government demanded to know why there were no murder convictions after a 20 year probe which cost 100 million dollars (82 million) Families of passengers who perished, in both Canada and India, proclaimed a "mockery of justice" and demanded a government investigation.
Canada's newspapers Thursday reflected a wave of shock at the acquittals of two Sikh men Ajaib Singh Bagri and Ripadaman Singh at the British Columbia Supreme Court.
Toronto based Globe and Mail devoted its front page to the headline "innocent" and the names of the 329 victims, 135 of them children, plus two baggage handlers killed in Tokyo in a related attack.
There were few critics of the judge, who found that the prosecution in the case, in Vancouver, the origin of two suitcase bombs, had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the two men were guilty.
"But Canadians can and should know what happened, how the investigation was handled, why it took so long to make arrests and whether Canada's police and intelligence communities have learned from it," the Toronto Star said in a hard hitting editorial.
Deputy Prime Minister Anne McLellan, said in the immediate aftermath of the verdict that she could "not see any benefit" to calling a public inquiry.
But relatives who lost loved ones on Wednesday lined up in a press conference in Vancouver to blast the Canadian police system and secret services and the government.
"The perpetrators of this crime are free men today, they have made a mockery of the Canadian justice system, said Eddie Maddon, whose father Sam died in the tragedy.
"The Canadian justice system has made a mockery of all of us," said John Chatlani, whose mother, brother and sister died.
Lata Pada, whose husband and two daughters died aboard the jumbo said the verdict "flies in the face of what we believe Canada to be, a fair society ,the government needs to be held accountable for this betrayal."
Relatives in victims in India also turned their fire on Canada.
"If the two accused who were narrowed down after a lot of investigation are not the culprits, then who is it," asked Bollywood actor Vijayendra Ghatge whose sister Sangeeta died in the mid air tragedy.
"Initially after the verdict I was disappointed, but now we relatives of the victims feel that justice needs to be done and there should be further, deep investigation," Ghatge told AFP.
Two Sikh men walked free after a judge Wednesday acquitted them of massacring 329 people in a 1985 Air India jet bombing, in the worst single airborne terror strike before September 11, 2001.
Loved ones of victims gasped in shock, as the judge threw out eight counts of murder and conspiracy each against Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, and Ripudaman Singh Malik, 58.
The dramatic judgements followed a near two year trial on prosecution claims that the two men planted the bomb, and another device which exploded on the ground in Tokyo, to punish India for its crackdown on Sikhs in the early 1980s.
"Despite the horrific nature of the alleged crimes, there can be no lowering of the standard of proof from that required in any criminal trial," said Justice Ian Bruce Josephson in the British Columbia Supreme Court.
The evidence had fallen "markedly short" of the standard required to convict the men, said Josephson, who heard the case in a specially constructed blast resistant courtroom without a jury.
Shellshocked prosecutors were left to ponder whether there was ground for appeal, and to defend their decision to bring the case to court.
"It is premature to say at this stage what will transpire," said prosecution spokesman Geoffrey Gaul.
But Josephson's verdict was so withering, and questioning of key witness testimony so acute, that the feasibility of an appeal was in question.
Malik and Bagri, orthodox Sikhs who immigrated to Canada from Punjab, were accused of conspiring to plant suitcase bombs on two aircraft.
Prosecutors claimed the two men worked with a Sikh group to build suitcase bombs on Vancouver Island, then planted the explosives on two flights from Vancouver that connected with Air India planes.
One bomb exploded in the hold of Air India Flight 182 over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Ireland on June 23, 1985.
All 329 people aboard the jumbo jet died.
Just 54 minutes earlier, another bomb had exploded at Japan's Narita airport, killing two baggage handlers transferring suitcases to Air India Flight 201.
Bagri, a free man for the first time in four years, told reporters outside court that he had been accused of horrendous crimes.
"I had absolutely no involvement in any of these criminal acts.
The loss of so many innocent lives resulting from these events was an enormous tragedy."
But for relatives of those who perished on the Air India plane, there was only the agony of reopened wounds, 20 years on, and demands for the true culprits of the outrage to be brought to justice.
"I can't believe it, I can't believe it," one man cried in court.
Another man, Rattan Singh Kalsi, who lost his daughter in the tragedy on June 23, 1985, was crying along with his wife.
"They should not have brought the case to court.
We were suffering but now we are suffering more."
Rumi Shross, who lost a friend in the disaster, said he could not comprehend the verdict.
"I have no words to describe it, how difficult it is," he told CBC television.
"I lost a very dear friend 20 years ago, my mind is totally blank ,329 innocent lives were lost."
Canada's Deputy Prime Minister Anne McLellan said it was too early to say whether a public inquiry was needed, despite calls from victims' families who argue the police and security services botched the case.
Aside from the acquitted Bagri and Malik, a third man, Inderjit Singh Reyat was convicted in the Narita explosion and sentenced to 10 years, before he was charged with the bomb on Flight 182.
In 2003, just before the trial was to begin, Reyat pleaded guilty to manslaughter, and is serving a five year sentence.
Another immigrant to Canada, Tarwinder Singh Parma, was the alleged mastermind of the plot and died in a 1992 police shootout in India.
During the trial, prosecutors contended that Malik, a millionaire Vancouver businessman, and Bagri, a rural millworker, were part of a radical Sikh group based on Canada's west coast.
Its mission was to punish India for its crackdown on Sikhs in the early 1980s and the army's attack on the Sikh Golden Temple at Amritsar, prosecutor Robert Wright told the court.
A Canadian judge acquitted two Indian born Sikhs of killing 331 people two decades ago in the bombings of an Air India plane over the Atlantic and a Tokyo airport.
The verdict ended a two year trial in Canada's worst case of mass murder.
British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Ian Josephson said Wednesday that the prosecution's key witnesses were not credible.
The bombings were the deadliest terrorist strikes before the Sept 11 attacks.
"Words are incapable of adequately conveying the senseless horror of these crimes," said Josephson, who heard the case without a jury at the defendants' request.
"Hundreds of men, women and children were entirely innocent victims of a diabolical act of terrorism."
Spectators in the courtroom, including dozens of victims' relatives, gasped when the verdicts were read.
Some started wailing.
"Why did they even have this trial?" said Rattan Singh Kalsi, 75, of London, Ontario, whose daughter was aboard the Air India plane.
"We were suffering anyway.
Now we will suffer more."
The defendants Ripudaman Singh Malik, 58, and Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55 were immediately released.
Malik smiled as he swept through a crowd of reporters surrounded by police to a waiting car.
"If these men are not guilty.
Then who killed all those innocent travelers?" asked a sobbing Mukta Bhat, who lost son, daughter in law and 6 month old grandson in the attack.
"Who will answer for all our years of pain?"
Like many others across India, Bhat, 73, of Bombay, stayed up past midnight Indian time to learn the verdict.
Air India Flight 182 from Montreal to London, originating in Vancouver, exploded and crashed off Ireland on June 23, 1985.
All 329 people on board, mostly Canadians, were killed.
An hour earlier, a bomb in baggage intended for another Air India flight exploded in the Narita airport, killing two baggage handlers.
Speaking on behalf of the families, Susheel Gupta, who lost his mother on the flight, called on the Canadian government to conduct a public inquiry into the case.
"This was murder pure and simple," he said.
"Murder.
Murder in any system demands justice."
"Through no fault of their own in traveling to India and no fault of ours, our loved ones never came home."
Prosecutor Robert Wright maintained that the bombing was revenge by Sikh separatists for a deadly 1984 raid by Indian forces on the Golden Temple at Amritsar, the holiest site in their religion.
Bagri, a "militant Sikh terrorist," gave a speech in New York that urged the killing of Hindus in the drive for a separate Sikh state of Khalistan, Wright said.
In a July 21, 1984, speech at Madison Square Garden, Bagri said: "Until we kill 50000 Hindus, we will not rest."
In their opening statements starting April 28, 2003, lawyers for Bagri and Malik said prosecutors had a weak case that hinged on the testimony of three star witnesses and bomb experts.
Josephson dismissed the credibility of prosecution witnesses, including a woman who said Malik told her of a plan to smuggle two bombs on flights from Vancouver that would be transferred to two Air India jets.
Josephson said the testimony of the woman, who claimed she and Malik were in love, was at the heart of the case against Malik.
But on greater examination, he said: "I find that she has not been truthful with the court and that I am unable to rely on her."
The woman remains in a witness protection program.
Josephson gave similar assessments about many of the other major prosecution witnesses.
The star witness against Bagri had testified the accused told him, "We did this," when talking about the bombing outside a New Jersey gas station.
Josephson, however, said the man was motivated by self interest.
He was willing "to engage in deception and lies, even under penalty of perjury, whenever he believed it would advance his self interest," he said in dismissing the evidence.
Reporters were barred from identifying any of the witnesses.
Investigators believe the Air India bombing was masterminded by Talwinder Singh Parmar, leader of the extremist Babbar Khalsa group that advocates creating a Sikh state called Khalistan in India's Punjab region.
Parmar was killed by Indian police in 1992.
Malik worked as a taxi driver after arriving in Canada from India in 1972 and built up business holdings, becoming a driving force behind the Vancouver area Khalsa Credit Union with assets of more than US$1 million.
Bagri arrived in Canada in 1968, according to court documents, and was a mill worker.
A third man in the case, alleged bomb maker Inderjit Singh Reyat, pleaded guilty Feb 10 to one count of manslaughter and was sentenced to five years in jail.
After Reyat's guilty plea, Malik and Bagri chose a trial by judge.
Reyat previously served a 10 year sentence for his 1991 conviction in the Tokyo airport bombing.
A fourth man, former Vancouver Sikh Temple president Hardial Singh Johal, was arrested but not charged in the case.
He has since died.
Canadian prosecutors began wrapping up their final arguements here Monday in the trial of two Sikh immigrants from India charged with conspiring to bomb Air India passenger jets in 1985, resulting in the deaths of 331 people.
The two Sikh immigrants, Ajaib Singh Bagri and Ripudaman Singh Malik, are each charged with eight counts of murder and conspiracy in the bombing, the deadliest single terrorist act until the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.
Prosecutors have argued that Bagri and Malik were among a group of orthodox Sikh immigrants to Canada who, in the turbulent 1980s, waged a campaign against India for its crackdown on religious Sikhs.
Bagri's lawyer says his client was the innocent victim in the case.
Prosecutor Robin Wright said his team will drive home an arguement that the pair were part of a plot to check two suitcase bombs onto Air India aircraft departing Vancouver.
He said proof of their guilt ranges from providing financial assistance to a man convicted in the case, attempting to interfere with police investigations and admissions to people they trusted.
Two bombs blew up on June 23, 1985, with the first killing two baggage handlers at Japan's Narita airport as they transferred baggage to an Air India plane.
The second bomb killed 329 passengers aboard Air India Flight 182 off the Irish Coast.
"There is no doubt these people were murdered," said Wright, adding that the only explanation for the bombing was "political and religious zealotry."
The case against Bagri and Malik relies on key witnesses who say the accused confessed details of their involvement, circumstantial evidence, and motives.
Prosecutors say both men were part of a group of extremist Sikhs bent on avenging India's attack on the Sikh Golden Temple at Amritsar in 1984.
The prosecution team will spend the next three weeks finalizing their case before Justice Ian Bruce Josephson.
Josephson is hearing the complicated trial alone without a jury.
Earlier this month, defence teams for both accused wrapped up their closing arguments.
The judge is expected to reserve his ruling in the case, possibly for several months.
Final arguments in the murder trial of two Sikhs charged with the 1985 bombing of an Air India jumbo jet concluded, ending one of the most exhaustive and expensive trials in Canadian history.
The trial against a millionaire and a mill worker charged with multiple counts of conspiracy and first degree murder hinges on the testimony of three star witnesses and contradicting bombing experts.
British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Ian Josephson announced Friday he will deliver a decision on March 16, 2005.
The case has called 115 witnesses since it began in April 2003.
With a specially built courtroom, the trial cost more than US$100 million (euro75 million).
Ripudaman Singh Malik, a 57 year old millionaire, and Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, are charged with planting bombs that exploded June 23, 1985, aboard Flight 182, killing 329 people, and 53 minutes earlier at Tokyo's Narita Airport, killing two baggage handlers.
Alleged bombmaker Inderjit Singh Reyat has already pleaded guilty to manslaughter and is in prison.
Perviz Madon lost her husband, Sam, on Flight 182.
She and her son, Eddie, have attended the trial regularly.
"I think the waiting is going to be hard," she said of the case going to the judge.
"Let's just hope the wait will be worth it."
The prosecution alleges the motive was revenge against the Indian government's 1984 attack against separatists who had taken refuge in the Golden Temple of Amritsar, Sikhism's holiest shrine.
The attack also led to the 1984 assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards.
The prosecution said the accused were zealots driven by a desire to create an independent Sikh state of Khalistan in the Punjab region of northern India and wanted to teach the Indian government a lesson.
"All Sikhs ,felt a terrible sacrilege had been committed against their religion," prosecutor Joe Bellows said during closing arguments.
While the defense maintains there is no evidence Malik was interested in Indian politics, Bagri's political motivation appeared more concrete.
A month after the temple raid, thousands of Sikhs gathered at Madison Square Garden in New York City where Bagri reportedly told The World Sikh Organization: "Until we kill 50000 Hindus we will not rest."
The prosecution has alleged Malik and Bagri were members of the Babbar Khalsa Sikh terrorist group led by Talwinder Singh Parmar, the alleged mastermind of the bombing.
Parmar died in a shootout with Indian police in 1992.
A prosecution witness who testified that she had a close personal relationship with Malik, wrote in her diary that he had said: "We had Air India crash.
Nobody, nobody can do anything."
The defense has tried to discredit the testimony, saying she was a disgruntled former employee motivated by revenge.
The judge must also decide between the conflicting testimony of two bombing experts who testified earlier this year.
Bagri's lawyer, Richard Peck, said Friday: "This case has been a trek across a vast expanse of knowledge, experience, and law."
The defense lawyer for Malik, David Crossin, called the case a "logistical nightmare" and said, "I don't think there will ever be such a case like this again, in this country, or perhaps the world."
"It was a long haul, I'm glad it's over," Crossin said.
Crown spokesman Geoffrey Gaul said the trial lasted 202 days total and included 113 witnesses.
In all, 178 family members attended, many coming from around the world to view the trial, said Gaul.
Mysterious deaths have dogged the case from the start.
Tara Singh Hayer, a Vancouver area Sikh newspaper publisher and outspoken critic of Sikh extremism, was crippled after being shot in 1988.
He was killed later that year in another shooting.
In 1995, Bagri allegedly confessed his involvement to Tarsem Singh Purewal, a publisher of Britain's biggest Punjabi weekly newspaper who was murdered later that year.
Lawyers were set to begin crucial final arguments Tuesday in the case of two Sikh immigrants from India accused of the 1985 mid air bombing of an Air India plane which left 329 people dead.
Closing arguments were expected to start with the defence of Ripudaman Singh Malik, a millionaire businessman in Vancouver.
Lawyers for rural mill worker Ajaib Singh Bagri then were to present their defence, followed by the prosecution team.
The men, Sikhs who immigrated to Canada from India's northern state of Punjab, are each charged with eight counts of murder and conspiracy in what was the world's worst airborne terrorist act before September 11, 2001.
On June 23, 1985, a suitcase exploded at Japan's Narita airport, killing two baggage handlers as they transferred it to Air India Flight 301 for Bangkok and Delhi.
Less than an hour later, off the coast of Ireland, a second bomb ripped through Air India Flight 182 as it flew to London from Montreal.
All 329 people on board died.
Though separated by long years and thousands of miles, both the 2001 hijackings of four US jets, two of which crashed into New York's World Trade Center, and the 1985 Air India bombings, were allegedly carried out by fundamentalists bent on revenge against a foreign government.
Prosecutors contend Malik and Bagri, with others, planted bombs on Air India jets to punish the Indian government for its 1983 army attack on Sikhdom's most holy place, the Golden Temple at Amritsar.
At the time, Sikh separatists were fighting for an independent homeland in India's Punjab.
By the time Justice Ian Bruce Josephson of the British Columbia Supreme Court renders a decision on Malik and Bagri, the Air India case will be nearly 20 years old.
The verdict is unlikely to be the final chapter in the bombings case, however, because police continue to investigate other suspects.
Since the trial began in April 2003, Canadian prosecutors have constructed a complex case against the pair, based on witness testimony, police interviews, phone records and surveillance.
The trial is being held in a 7.5 million Canadian dollar (5.6 million US) bunker like, bomb proof, bullet resistant court built especially for this case.
The court also designated as a remote annex a vast warehouse in a secret location.
Within it is a skeleton of a Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet, named the Kanishka by Air India.
Parts of the plane were hauled from the bed of the Atlantic Ocean, shipped to Canada and reconstructed by police.
Prosecutors say Sikh extremists in Canada built two suitcase bombs, bought airline tickets and checked the suitcase bombs onto Vancouver flights connecting with Air India.
A third man, Inderjit Singh Reyat, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for a conviction in the Narita explosion, and was also charged with Bagri and Malik.
In 2003, Reyat pleaded guilty to manslaughter for supplying bomb materials and received a five year sentence.
Both prosecution cases hinge partly on women who were allegedly close to Malik and Bagri.
The first woman to testify once worked for Malik and says the pair were in love.
She told the court Malik once confided to her, "We had Air India crash."
Malik's lawyers are expected to reiterate arguments that the woman's testimony is not credible.
The second woman alleged that Bagri asked to borrow her car about the time the suitcase bombs were delivered to the airport.
The identity of both women, as with many other witnesses in the case, is shielded under a publication ban.
Two potential witnesses in the case, both Sikh journalists, were assassinated.
Other witnesses allege they have received threats.
Two fiery speeches delivered to Sikh groups in the early 1980s show Ajaib Singh Bagri had a motive to plant bombs on Air India jets killing 331 people, a prosecutor said in closing arguments Monday.
Bagri, a 55 year old mill worker in Kamloops, British Columbia, and Vancouver millionaire Ripudaman Singh Malik, 57, are charged with multiple counts of conspiracy and first degree murder in the world's worst airline terrorism act before the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.
Air India Flight 182, a Boeing 747 on its way from Toronto to India via London, blew up off the Irish coast on June 23, 1985, killing all aboard.
A second bomb exploded at Tokyo's Narita Airport, killing two baggage handlers.
Prosecutor Richard Cairns argued that Bargris was a high ranking member of a terrorist group.
"Revenge, revenge, revenge.
That's what he wants."
Cairns said Bagri gave two speeches calling for retribution for the 1984 raids on India's Golden Temple, Sikhisms holiest shrine.
Cairns also said Bagri made pointed references to Air India, saying the Indian government used proceeds from the airline to purchase weapons to use against Sikhs.
"Bagri is exhorting the crowd to take revenge on the Indian government and Hindus," Cairns said.
He said that in the speech, Bagri "identifies his targets and he advocates revenge."
The defense has argued that Bagri's speeches amount only to fiery oratory, and has questioned the credibility of witnesses in the case, including that the star witness against Bagri, who was paid to testify by Canadian authorities.
That witness, a member of a militant Sikh group whose identity is protected by the court, said Bagri told him that he was responsible for the bombings.
Bagri allegedly made the comment following a speech he gave at New York's Madison Square Gardens.
"'We have stuff that can blow like, like a (city) block," Cairns said, repeating the witnesses' testimony of what Bagri told him.
The witness, who is not charged with a crime, was paid US$386000 (euro298000) to testify.
Cairns also noted that another protected witness testified that Bagri asked her if he could borrow her car to take some bags to Vancouver International Airport.
The bags would be going on the plane, he would not, the woman testified.
A verdict in the trial which began in April 2003 isn't expected until early 2005.
The trial of two men accused of bombing an Air India jumbo jet and killing 329 people almost 20 years ago entered its final stretch Tuesday with the defense attacking the credibility of a star government witness.
Vancouver millionaire Ripudaman Singh Malik, 57, and Kamloops, British Columbia mill worker Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, are charged with multiple counts of conspiracy and first degree murder in the world's worst airline terrorism act prior to the Sept 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.
Air India flight 182, a Boeing 747 on its way from Toronto to India via London, blew up off the Irish coast on June 23, 1985, killing all aboard.
Malik and Bagri, who have been in custody since their arrest in late 2000, are also charged in connection with a blast on the same day that killed two baggage handlers at Tokyo's Narita Airport.
The case in British Columbia Supreme Court has stretched for 13 months since hearings began in April 2003.
More than 32 lawyers are working on the case, which is believed to have cost more than US$80 million (euro64 million).
Perviz Madon lost her husband, Sam, on flight 182.
She wants to see the trial over by the end of the year.
"It's time we had a closure," she said.
"It's been 20 years, for God's sake.
We're tired."
Final arguments are expected to last into December.
The case is being heard in a US$5 million (euro4 million) courtroom specifically built for security precautions.
The defense argument hinges on attacking the credibility of a star witness for the government, and asserting that at least one of the defendants lacked a motive.
Defense lawyer David Crossin argued Tuesday that the witness had an ulterior motive to testify against Malik because she is a former disgruntled employee of his.
The woman is in a government witness protection program and a court order bars the publication of her name.
The woman, who testified that she had a close personal relationship with Malik, wrote in her diary that he had said: "We had Air India crash.
Nobody, nobody can do anything."
Crossin said the prosecution's case "stands or falls on the evidence of this woman."
"We suggest the nature of that false evidence is profound," he said.
Another prosecution witness, a man who was a member of a Sikh militant group in New York, testified that Bagri as much as confessed to him outside a New Jersey gas station.
"We did this," the man, whom the Canadian government paid US$365000 (euro293000) to testify, said Bagri told him.
His identity is also protected by the court.
Prosecutors believe Malik and Bagri were part of a conspiracy by British Columbia based Sikh extremists to take revenge against the Indian government, which owns Air India planes, for attacking a Sikh temple in 1984.
But the defense argued Tuesday there is no evidence Malik was at all interested in Indian politics.
Defense lawyers also contended that he had substantial dealings with the state bank of India, which militant Sikhs would have boycotted.
"In our view, it is inconceivable that anyone would have participated in this crime without a political motive," Crossin said.
Bagri's political motivation appears more concrete.
A month after the temple raid, thousands of Sikhs gathered at Madison Square Garden in New York City where Bagri reportedly told The World Sikh Organization: "Until we kill 50000 Hindus we will not rest."
He proposed the creation of a Sikh homeland called Khalistan and "spoke of the need for Sikhs to wage a war of independence to exact revenge against the Indian government," according to documents released by the court.
Bagri has also been accused of inciting people at Sikh temples in British Columbia and Ontario, and for calling for the death of then Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi.
She was assassinated in 1984.
Much of the case, however, hinges on the position of the bomb on Flight 182, which originated in Vancouver.
Prosecutors have argued the bomb was in luggage originating in Vancouver.
But Bagri's lawyers contend the luggage containing the bomb joined the flight in Toronto.
If Judge Ian Josephson accepts that defense, Bagri may be acquitted.
Prosecutors maintain that Talwinder Singh Parmar, founder of the militant Babbar Khalsa Sikh militant group, was the mastermind behind the bombings.
He died in a shootout with Indian police in 1992.
Mysterious deaths have dogged the case from the start.
Tara Singh Hayer, a Vancouver area Sikh newspaper publisher and outspoken critic of Sikh extremism, was crippled after being shot in 1988.
He was killed in November 1998 after another shooting.
In 1995, Bagri also allegedly confessed his involvement to Tarsem Singh Purewal, publisher of Britain's biggest Punjabi weekly newspaper.
Purewal, who was murdered in 1995, had been friends with Hayer.
On the Net: Air India Trial: http//www.airindiatrial.ca
Two men charged with murder and conspiracy in the Air India bombings, the world's most lethal terror strike prior to September 11, 2001, will wait until March to hear a verdict, a judge said Friday.
After 19 months of complex hearings, the massive trial of Ajaib Singh Bagri and Ripudaman Singh Malik ended Friday with lawyers on all sides trying to score a few last points.
Justice Ian Bruce Josephson, who heard the case without a jury in this western Canadian city, said he will reveal his decision March 16.
Bagri and Malik, who were arrested in 2000, are each charged with eight counts related to two bombings on June 23, 1985.
On that day a suitcase bomb exploded at Japan's Narita airport, killing two Japanese baggage handlers as they transferred it to an Air India jet.
Less than an hour later, Air India Flight 182 exploded off the Irish coast, killing all 329 aboard.
John Ward of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told reporters that 250 officers have worked on the case since 1985.
The investigation into more suspects continues, he said.
"We still have 12 RCMP officers working on this case.
We're not done yet."
Prosecution spokesperson Geoffrey Gaul said 113 witnesses testified for the government and for Bagri and Malik's defence teams.
The trial was held behind bullet resistant glass in a specially built, secure, 7.5 million dollar (6.3 million US) underground courtroom.
Bagri, a Sikh preacher and rural millworker, and Malik, a millionaire Vancouver businessman, maintained their innocence.
The pair is accused of taking part in a plot by Sikh fundamentalists to build two bombs and plant them on two flights leaving Vancouver that connected with Air India flights to London and Delhi.
Government prosecutors contend that Malik arranged and paid for the airline tickets used to check the suitcase bombs onto planes, and that Bagri arranged to get the bombs to the airport.
The motive in targetting the Indian planes, said Gaul, was to fight for the cause of an independent Sikh homeland, to be called Khalistan, and avenge India's 1984 attack on the Sikh Golden Temple at Amritsar.
The alleged mastermind of the plot, Talwinder Singh Parmar, was killed in a police shootout in India in 1992.
Nearly 20 years will have elapsed by the time Josephson rules on the guilt of the two men, who emigrated to Canada from Punjab.
A third man in Canada, Inderjit Singh Reyat, pled guilty in 2003 to manslaughter for his role in providing material for the bomb on Flight 182, and was sentenced to five years.
The Air India bombing stood as the worst terror attack in modern history, until it was overtaken by the carnage of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the United States in 2001.
Nearly 20 years after their loved ones died in the worst terror strike prior to the September 11 attacks, relatives of 329 people killed in an Air India jet bombing are at last in sight of justice.
Two orthodox Sikhs will learn in March whether they will be found guilty of the 1985 outrage.
Their trial ended Friday after sapping millions of dollars from Canadian coffers.
Justice Ian Bruce Josephson, who heard the case without a jury, will rule on March 16.
That will be nearly two decades after suitcase bombs, which allegedly originated in western Canada, killed two baggage handlers in Japan and 329 passengers on Air India Flight 182 off the Irish coast.
Even before the verdict is pronounced, relatives of the 331 victims are calling for a public inquiry.
Earlier calls for an official probe were stymied by the criminal investigation, and eventual trial of Ajaib Singh Bagri and Ripudaman Singh Malik.
The two accused, immigrants from Punjab, were each charged with eight charges of murder and conspiracy.
The massive case was the largest and most complex in Canadian history, with 18 months of pre trial hearings, numerous related court hearings and a 19 month trial involving 113 witnesses and millions of documents.
The trial itself took place behind bullet resistant glass in a specially built underground bunker of a courtroom in this west coast city.
Prosecutors said Bagri and Malik were religious Sikh fundamentalists who used violence to achieve their political goals.
Their motive in the bombings, said prosecution spokesman Geoffrey Gaul, was to avenge India's 1984 attack on the Golden Temple in Amritsar, and fight for an independent Sikh homeland to be called Khalistan.
Prosecutors say two suitcase bombs were checked onto planes leaving Vancouver, connecting with Air India flights to London and Bangkok and New Delhi.
On June 23, 1985, the first bomb killed two baggage handlers at Japan's Narita airport, as they transferred it to Air India Flight 201.
The second exploded 54 minutes later aboard Air India Flight 182, killing all 329 aboard.
Defence lawyers maintain their clients are innocent and prosecution witnesses were either lying or delusional.
"The witnesses weren't credible," said Malik's lawyer David Crossin.
"Their case collapsed."
So far, only Inderjit Singh Reyat, an immigrant to Canada, has been punished for the 1985 terrorism.
He was convicted in 1991 for providing materials for the bomb at Tokyo's Narita airport.
In 2003, he also pled guilty to manslaughter in the Flight 182 bombing.
He is serving two sentences totalling 15 years.
The alleged mastermind of the plot, Tarwinder Singh Parma, died in a 1992 police shootout in India.
With the trial of Bagri and Malik now over, it's past time for an inquiry into the bombings, said Perviz Madon, whose husband Sam, a college professor, died aboard Air India on June 23, 1985.
"I am so tired, but we need the answers," said Madon.
Relatives believe that if the details of the Air India bombings had emerged immediately, global airline practices would have changed before the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people died.
In both disasters, critics blamed lax airport and airline security.
A public inquiry would also investigate how police and intelligence agents handled the Air India case, which was plagued by infighting between agencies and the erasure of evidence.
Meanwhile, two potential witnesses were assassinated even before charges were laid.
Fear of intimidation in Canada's immigrant Sikh community has led to police protection for several prosecution witnesses.
Some observers believe that even though the trial is over, more details of the case are lurking unseen.
"There are more people involved than the two people who are charged," said Dave Hayer, an British Columbia provincial legislator.
Hayers father, Tara Singh Hayer, publisher of a local Sikh newspaper, was assassinated in 1998 before he could give evidence involving Bagri.
No one has been charged with the murder.
"Many people are not willing to talk, theyre still afraid," Hayer said.
Nearly 20 years after an Air India Boeing 747 from Canada exploded in the air and plunged into waters off the Irish coast, killing all 329 people on board, the trial to finally resolve what happened entered its climactic phase this week.
More than 100 witnesses have testified during nearly two years of proceedings in the most serious terrorism trial in Canadian history.
A special high security courtroom was built for the case, at a cost of $6 million, complete with a prisoner dock encased in bulletproof glass.
Aging relatives of the victims came from as far away as Sri Lanka to watch from the court gallery.
But as prosecutors began their final arguments Monday to convict two Canadian Sikh activists accused of plotting the bombing, the outcome of the trial is far from settled because of years of bungled police work and the unexplained killings of an important witness and suspect.
In addition, key witnesses offered vague and contradictory recollections, and key evidence is circumstantial.
Both defendants Ripudaman Singh Malik, a 57 year old millionaire real estate entrepreneur, and Ajaib Singh Bagri, a 56 year old sawmill worker and Sikh preacher pleaded not guilty to charges of first degree murder and conspiracy in the bombing of the jet, Air India Flight 182 en route from Toronto and Montreal to India, on June 23, 1985.
The two are also charged with conspiring in an explosion that killed two baggage handlers at Narita airport outside Tokyo 54 minutes before Flight 182 went down.
Prosecutors said both bombs were placed on Air India aircraft in Vancouver.
"This was a murder plot in which two planes were to explode simultaneously," said Robert H. Wright, the chief prosecutor as he began to sum up his case.
"It is difficult to comprehend how this would happen.
Who would do something so terrible?"
Answering his own question, Wright told the court that only "political and religious zealotry" could motivate such a crime.
Prosecutors say Malik, who has worn a white tunic at the trial, recruited members of the plot and gave $3000 to a friend to pick up tickets for the flight with the ultimate aim of planting the bomb on Flight 182.
Bagri, who wears a dark turban, is accused of taking luggage with the explosives to the Vancouver airport.
Neither Malik nor Bagri chose to testify.
Prosecutors have alleged that Malik and Bagri were motivated to revenge the 1984 Indian army storming of the Golden Temple of Amritsar after the holy shrine was taken over by militant Sikhs.
That attack sparked a cascade of violence and revenge killings that included the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
With no physical evidence or firsthand testimony linking the accused to the bombing, the outcome of the trial is in doubt.
The prosecution wraps up its case in the next few weeks, and Justice Ian Bruce Josephson is expected to reach a decision early next year.
The prosecution has shown a video of Bagri giving an incendiary speech at a New York Sikh rally in July 1984 in which he said, "We will not take rest until we kill 50000 Hindus."
But most of the prosecution's case is based on supposed confessions Malik and Bagri gave to several associates that they deny making.
The government has highlighted statements made by a Canadian Security Intelligence Service agent that a friend of Bagri said he had visited the night before the bombing to ask to borrow her car to drop off some bags at the airport.
By court order, the woman, like other key witnesses, cannot be identified.
The agent testified that the woman said that Bagri implied that wrongdoing would be done, but, during the trial, she said she did not remember making such statements.
Josephson ruled that her prior testimony should be admitted as evidence after the prosecution argued that witnesses were coming under pressure from Sikh activists.
The key prosecution witness against Malik is a former employee at a religious school that Malik directed.
She testified that he told her in 1996 and 1997, while they were involved in a strong personal, but platonic relationship, that he helped organize the conspiracy and detailed his role in arranging for the purchase and pickup of airline tickets that were used to check in the baggage with the explosives.
The witness said she distanced herself from him after the admissions, after which she was subjected to threats.
She was eventually fired.
Malik's lawyer questioned her credibility as a disgruntled employee.
The prosecution has also been hampered by the fact that the suspected main ringleader of the plot, a former Canadian resident, Talwinder Singh Parmar, was killed by Indian authorities when they caught him clandestinely crossing from Pakistan in 1992.
Tara Singh Hayer, the publisher of a Sikh newspaper in Vancouver, told police in 1995 that he had overheard Bagri admit to his role in the attacks.
But three years later, Hayer was gunned down outside his home in a Vancouver suburb.
Prosecutors were also held back by numerous errors made by investigators.
The Canadian intelligence service withdrew an agent who had infiltrated Sikh activist ranks only days before the attacks and erased hours of tape recordings of conversations by several of the prime suspects intercepted before the plane bombings.
They later said they had not realized the significance of the tapes.
Meanwhile, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police failed to follow up on crucial evidence for years, apparently because of internal politics.
"We feel a deep sense of betrayal on the part of the Canadian government," said Lata Pada, a 56 year old choreographer from Toronto who lost her husband and two daughters on the flight.
"Canada has still not woken up to the reality that global terrorism is still in our back yard."
The prosecution began final arguments Monday in the case of an Air India jumbo jet bombing that killing 329 people almost 20 years ago, saying the two men accused in the Canadian trial were guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
Vancouver millionaire Ripudaman Singh Malik, 57, and Kamloops, British Columbia mill worker Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, are charged with multiple counts of conspiracy and first degree murder in the world's worst airline terrorism act prior to the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
Air India flight 182, a Boeing 747 named The Emperor Kanishka for the Indian ruler at the time of Christ, blew up off the Irish coast on June 23, 1985, killing all aboard.
The plane was traveling from Toronto to India via London.
Malik and Bagri, who have been in custody since their arrest in late 2000, are also charged in connection with a blast on the same June day that killed two baggage handlers at Tokyo's Narita Airport.
More than 32 lawyers are working on the case believed to have cost more than US$80 million (euro64 million) since hearings began in April 2003.
It is being heard in a US$5 million (euro3.9 million) British Columbia Supreme Court room specifically built for security precautions.
Prosecutors believe Malik and Bagri were part of a conspiracy by British Columbia based Sikh extremists to take revenge against the Indian government, which owns Air India planes, for attacking a Sikh temple in 1984.
Prosecution lawyer Robert Wright on Monday opened final arguments expected to last two weeks, saying the guilt of Bagri and Malik "has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt."
"This is, in our submission, a politically motivated and terrorist event ,consistent only with a political and religious zealotry," Wright said.
The prosecution has noted that Bagri reportedly told The World Sikh Organization in 1984 at Madison Square Garden in New York City: "Until we kill 50000 Hindus we will not rest."
He proposed the creation of a Sikh homeland called Khalistan and "spoke of the need for Sikhs to wage a war of independence to exact revenge against the Indian government", according to documents released by the court.
Bagri has also been accused of inciting people at Sikh temples in British Columbia and Ontario, and for calling for the death of then Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi.
She was assassinated in 1984.
"Who would do something so terrible to kill so many innocent people?
There is no doubt these people were murdered," Wright said.
The prosecution's case is largely based on the testimony of three witnesses who said the defendants had confessed the crimes to them.
"These admissions are the ultimate piece of evidence against the accused," Wright said.
The defense has attacked the credibility of these witnesses and asserted that Malik lacked a motive because he was not interested in Indian politics.
Defense lawyer David Crossin argued two weeks ago that one witness was a former disgruntled employee, another was paid $US365000 (euro285000) by the government to testify and the third denied evidence on the stand she had given to investigators years ago.
Much of the case, however, hinges on the position of the bomb on flight 182, which originated in Vancouver.
Prosecutors have argued the bomb was in luggage originating in Vancouver.
But Bagri's lawyers contend the luggage containing the bomb joined the flight in Toronto.
"There was a murder plot in which two planes were supposed to explode simultaneously.
The two bombs originated here in the city of Vancouver," Wright said.
He said Malik booked and paid for the tickets while Bagri arranged for bags containing the bombs to be delivered to the airport.
Expert prosecution witnesses who testified also worked on the investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 which blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, killing 270 people.
At a secret Vancouver warehouse, salvaged parts of the plane have been reassembled with other parts fabricated using film footage of pieces still on the ocean floor.
One of two men accused in the 1985 Air India bombings that claimed 331 lives was driven by ambition and revenge, a prosecutor told a Canadian court in his closing arguments Monday.
Vancouver millionaire Ripudaman Singh Malik, 57, and Kamloops, British Columbia, mill worker Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, are charged with multiple counts of conspiracy and first degree murder in the world's worst airline terrorism act prior to the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
Air India Flight 182, a Boeing 747 on its way from Toronto to India via London, blew up off the Irish coast on June 23, 1985, killing all aboard.
A second bomb exploded at Tokyo's Narita Airport, killing two baggage handlers.
"It has been shown (Malik) has a powerful and pervasive motive," prosecutor Joe Bellows said in British Columbia Supreme Court.
He told Judge Ian Josephson that the Indian government's 1984 attack on the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Sikhism's holiest shrine, was a pivotal event in Malik's desire for revenge.
Hundreds died in the attack.
"All Sikhs ,felt a terrible sacrilege had been committed against their religion," Bellows said.
"They ignited in Malik emotions of both ambition and revenge," he said.
"Malik and his co conspirators chose to destroy not one but two Air India planes.
The message to be conveyed was: If we can do this, we can do anything."
Bellows said the 1984 assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards was also part of the reaction to the temple raid.
As Bellows spoke, Malik, dressed in traditional Sikh garb, dozed in the prisoners' box protected by bulletproof glass.
Bellows said Malik's praise for convicted bomb maker Inderjit Singh Reyat and his financial support for Reyat's family while in prison is further proof of his involvement in the plot.
Bellows said Malik wanted to teach the Indian government a lesson as Sikhs fought for the creation of an independent Sikh homeland, Khalistan, in India's Punjab state.
Bellows recounted the testimony of one man who said Malik had approached him to carry an attache case containing a time bomb to Vancouver's airport.
"If a child dies for Sikhism, so what?"
Bellows recalled, quoting from the witness' testimony of what Malik told him.
"To Malik, the death of a child means nothing, the death of 329 people means nothing.
What matters is Khalistan."
The witness, whose name is protected by a court ordered publication ban, said Malik had been asked to approach him for the task by Talwinder Singh Parmar, the suspected mastermind behind the plot and a leader of the extremist Babbar Khalsa Sikh separatist group.
Parmar died in a shootout with Indian police in 1992.
Bellows showed the court a Canadian intelligence photograph of Malik outside Parmar's home five days before the bombings.
The defense has tried to discredit Malik's alleged confession of his involvement in the bombings to an intimate female friend whose name is also protected by the court.
She was a disgruntled former employee motivated by revenge, defense lawyers argued.
Bellows, however, said the Crown witness was highly credible and that the case against Malik "is proven on her evidence alone."
The woman, who testified that she had a close personal relationship with Malik, wrote in her diary that he had said: "We had Air India crash.
Nobody, nobody can do anything."
Malik and Bagri, who have been in custody since their arrest in late 2000, are also charged with the Narita blast.
Bellows was expected to continue his closing arguments on Tuesday, and the case is likely to go to the judge for a verdict in mid December.
The defense concluded its case last month.
Malik's legal team said their client is innocent and accused the witnesses against him of being motivated by a desire for revenge.
The case has stretched for 13 months since hearings began in April 2003.
More than 32 lawyers are working on the case, which is believed to have cost more than $US80 million (euro62 million).
With the government's efforts to promote renewable energy, the installation density of solar water heaters in Taiwan is the third highest in the world, Vice Economics Minister Hou Ho shong said Wednesday.
Addressing a seminar held by the Chung Hua Institution for Economic Research on the impact of soaring oil prices on the economy, Hou pointed out that the government is trying to work out plans for energy conservation and the enhancement of energy efficiency to cope with the high oil prices.
These include a plan to amend the Energy Management Law to regulate energy efficiency and to enact a renewable energy development law with the goal of seeing renewable energy generation reach 5130 megawatts, or 10 percent of the total capacity generated by the country's power stations, by 2010, Hou said.
Hou noted that the government is promoting the use of various renewable energy sources, including wind force, solar power, solar thermal, biomass energy and geothermal energy.
The government is also planning to set up a solar heating indoor swimming pool this year, Hou said.
Hou said the government has subsidized the installation of 74 solar power systems with a total generation capacity of 647 kilowatts, including one at the Presidential Office, and is carrying out a "solar powered city" project in Tainan County.
Also, the government is expected to complete the country's first geothermal power plant in Ilan County in 2007, he said.
Meanwhile, Hou said, the government is planning to replace all the traffic lights around the country with energy conserving light emitting diodes (LEDs) next year.
With the international oil prices rising to as high as US$70 per barrel in August and fluctuating around US$57 per barrel at present, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Ministry of Finance have suggested that the Cabinet lower the taxes on gasoline, diesel and fuel oil by 25 percent until Dec 31 in an effort to stabilize domestic consumer prices, he said.
The Indonesian government is planning to build thousands of small scale solar power units and microhydro plants on its eastern islands next year to boost power capacity in remote areas.
The government will build 15000 household solar power units, each with a capacity of 100 watts, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources' Director General of Electricity and Energy Yogo Pratomo was quoted Tuesday by The Jakarta Post as saying.
"We hope the (small scale) power units will meet electricity demand in remote areas in eastern Indonesia," he said.
Each of the solar cell units will cost between 5 million rupiah (500 US dollars) and 6 million rupiah in construction.
"However, they won't use any fuel except sunlight so there is no extra expense," said Yogo.
Aside from utilizing sunlight, the government also plans to build 200 microhydro power plants with a capacity of between 50 kilowatts (kW) and 500 kW each.
Investment needed for every kW is estimated at 20 million rupiah (2000 dollars).
The development of power capacity in the country has been hampered due to a lack of funds since the monetary crisis severely hit the country in 1997, despite the steadily rising demand.
State run electricity company PLN is focusing its expansion on Java where more than half of the country's population live and an estimated 70 percent of the country's economic activity is located Bali and Sumatra.
The company has allocated just 17 percent of its projects for other islands.
The latest data from the World Bank shows that the electrification ratio in Java reaches 72 percent, while that in Maluku is limited to 50 percent.
Only one in five people enjoys the luxury of electricity in natural resource rich Papua, Indonesia's least developed province.
Despite massive potential, power plants using renewable energy sources contribute only a small portion of the country's total installed power capacity of about 25000 megawatts (MW).
The installed capacity of mini and micro hydropower plants is only 54 MW, while those utilizing geothermal and biomass energy have installed capacity of 800 MW and 302 MW, respectively.
The government aims to raise the use of new and renewable energy sources in power generation from 0.2 percent currently to 4 percent by 2020.
Greece's president and prime minister have agreed to install solar panels at their official residences following a plea by the environmental group Greenpeace, the development ministry said Tuesday.
"The president agreed, with great pleasure, to proceed with a feasibility study on installing solar power cells at the presidential residence," Development Minister Dimitris Sioufas said after meeting President Karolos Papoulias.
He said Prime Minister Costas Caramanlis and the speaker of Greece's parliament had also agreed to go solar.
Last week, Greenpeace criticized Greece's government for failing to promote the use of the sun in power generation.
The environmental group said it would pay for solar panels to be installed at Caramanlis' residence.
The Angolan government has unveiled an ambitious scheme to supply solar energy to rural populations over the coming 15 years.
Launching the project in Luanda Friday, Deputy Energy Minister Rui Tito said studies indicate that Angola has sufficient potential for a nationwide rural electrification program using solar power.
Under the 220 million US dollars renewal energy scheme, 1300 villages across the country will be equipped with 15 solar generating plants each.
"The project aims to guarantee access to energy, giving better quality of life to people in remoter parts of the country," said Tito.
The Chinese government will raise about 180 billion US dollars to develop renewable energy from now to 2020, said a senior official at the Beijing International Renewable Energy Conference that opened here Monday By then, the share of renewable energy in primary energy consumption will stand at 15 percent, rising from the current seven percent, said Zhang Guobao, vice minister of the National Development and Reform Commission.
Renewable energy, including solar, wind power, and hydropower, will contribute to better energy security in China, said Zhang.
It also delivers substantial economic and environmental results, alleviating poverty.
In the coming 15 years, China will actively develop biomass liquid fuel with crops, said Zhang, to reach the capacity of replacing ten million tons of petroleum each year.
China also plans to expand the heat collection area of solar heater to 300 million cubic meters by 2020, replacing about 40 million tons of standard coal annually.
If solar power is going to become commonplace in the United States, more people like Aaron Dyer are going to have to buy it.
Dyer, 34, is a firefighter in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
He has a truck and a motorcycle.
He's a big time snowmobiler.
He's an average guy.
The only thing unusual with Dyer is that he has installed 32 solar panels on the roof of his garage.
They generate about 500 kilowatt hours of electricity a month for his newly built home here.
He turned on the system Sept 16.
It generates enough electricity to supply 90 percent to 100 percent of his electricity needs, saving him roughly $60 a month.
"I couldn't wait to turn it on," Dyer said.
"It was pretty awesome really.
It still is."
Dyer has had an interest in solar energy for years.
So when he started planning to build his house a few years ago, he contacted Renewable Power Systems LLC, an Averill Park, N.Y,, company that sells solar electricity or photovoltaic systems.
Dyer worked with Renewable Power to make sure he oriented his garage so that the solar panels would have southern exposure for maximum electrical production.
They also helped him design the system so that he would be eligible for grants and tax breaks through New York State's photovoltaic incentive program.
Dyer paid $20000 for the system using a home equity loan.
But he estimates that the money he paid was less than half of the true cost of the system because he qualified for a financial assistance program through the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.
The program pays $4 per watt of a system, as long as it is tied to the state electricity grid.
He also is eligible for up to $3750 in state tax credits over five years that the state gives to people who buy solar power generation equipment.
Dyer is part of a new breed of solar energy user.
Many of the initial adopters of the technology are people in their 50s and 60s who lived through the 1970s oil crisis.
But Michael Stangl, co owner of Renewable Power, said Dyer is part of a new generation that is not only interested in conservation but is also extremely savvy when it comes to their finances and combating rising energy costs.
"Somehow they picked up on the fact that energy is an important issue in our lives," Stangl said.
"He's kind of like the second generation."
Stangl's company is benefiting from solar energy becoming more popular with people like Dyer.
Renewable Power has sold 15 large residential solar power systems this year costing between $25000 and $50000, and it hopes to be selling two per month by the end of the year.
But the market has a lot more potential.
Dyer still represents a small group of Americans who are getting their electricity from solar power.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, of the 3.9 million gigawatt hours of electricity generated in the United States last year, only 597 gigawatt hours came from solar power.
Most electricity in the U.S. is generated by the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas.
The key to adding more solar power to the mix is making the technology cheaper, said Pradeep Haldar, director of the State University of New York at Albany's Energy and Environmental Technology Applications Center, which is part of Albany NanoTech.
Haldar said that solar energy systems cost between $8 and $10 per watt, but it would be "compelling" if the price could go down to $3 or $4 per watt.
"It's getting better and better," said Haldar.
"I think it's a matter of time."
The center, also known as E2TAC, is working with companies like DayStar Technologies Inc on the next generation of solar panel technologies that could be cheaper than the current silicon technology.
One of the reasons that new technologies are needed is because of a silicon shortage that is driving up prices.
According to Paul Maycock, a nationally recognized solar energy expert in Warrenton, Va., demand for silicon by the semiconductor industry and explosive growth of the solar industry, have caused silicon prices to double for the solar cell industry to more than $40 a kilogram.
Some consumers are moving to solar gradually.
Oleg Ivanov of Grafton, N.Y., said he plans to spend a small amount up to $5000 for a solar energy system that will store energy in batteries.
The 34 year old information technology audit consultant has been testing how the system works with small solar panels he bought that are designed to charge boat and car batteries.
He envisions a system that would provide between 300 and 500 watts of energy to supplement the electricity he buys from his utility.
"This way I can use less from the grid," he said.
Builders may hold another key to developing the solar energy market.
Michael Eidens, a former Schenectady, N.Y., judge who is now running for county legislator, is building a 3000 square foot house.
The construction firm he hired, Stewart Construction Inc., worked closely with Renewable Power, which installed a 3.34 kilowatt solar system on the home's roof.
Stewart Construction is building the home as an Energy Star home, a designation New York gives to homes that meet certain energy efficiency criteria.
"To make a big impact, you've got to work with builders," said Stangl, of Renewable Power.
"At the moment, we don't have a lot of builders doing it."
Philip LaRocque, executive vice president of the New York State Builders Association, said his group is extremely supportive of building energy efficient homes and the Energy Star program.
He said builders are more than happy to incorporate solar panels in homes if customers want it.
"We do live and breathe it," he said.
World Energy Giant BP group announced Thursday that its subsidiary BP Solar has signed a contract with a local company to form a joint venture to develop solar photovoltaic in China.
The joint venture, jointly established with China Xinjiang SunOasis Co., will see the creation of two companies, BP SunOasis Company Limited and BP SunOasis (Prime) Company Limited, which together will manufacture, market and sell solar photovoltaic (PV) products and systems in China.
Based in Xi'an, capital of West China's Shaanxi Province, the joint venture will enjoy a 25 megawatt manufacturing capacity.
It has a total registered capital of over 10 million US dollars and the equity percentage split between SunOasis and BP Solar is 51 to 49, according to BP.
The joint venture represents an excellent opportunity for BP Solar to position itself and grow in the growing solar PV market by expanding its manufacturing network.
China is planning for its domestic solar PV market to reach up to 400MW by 2010 and 10000 MW by 2020 from a 2005 base of 20MW.
According to BP, the joint venture will focus on providing access to sustainable power in remote rural areas throughout China, as well as the developing grid connect market.
Lee Edwards, CEO of BP Solar, said that it is a great strategic opportunity for SunOasis and BP Solar, both of which share a common vision for the long term solar potential in China.
The joint venture will add to BP Solar's already strong presence in the Asia Pacific region, he said.
As one of the world's largest oil, gas and petrochemical companies, BP has been operating in China since the early 1970s and has invested over three billion US dollars in the country's commercial projects.
So far, BP's activities in China include the production and importation of natural gas, supply of aviation fuel, import and marketing of LPG, fuels retailing, lubricants blending and sales, petrochemical manufacturing and solar electric facilities.
Xinjiang SunOasis Co., Ltd (SunOasis), founded in 2000, is a private limited company located in northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
Its largest shareholder, Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co., Ltd (TBEA) is a public listed company in China and one of the top largest transformer manufacturers in the world.
SunOasis is the leading solar system integrator in China with approximately 25 to 30 percent share of the Chinese market.
Italy will help Beijing build a solar energy system for the city's Olympic Village, supplying hot water and electricity for the Games in 2008 and beyond.
Corrado Clini, a top official from the Italian Ministry for the Environment, said Italy will invest a total of 4 million euros (4.7 million US dollars) in the project, according to Monday's China Daily.
The solar energy system will be jointly constructed by the Guoao Investment and Development Co. Ltd of China, and Italy's Merloni TermoSanitari International Trading Co. Ltd.
The project will supply hot water and electricity to 16000 people during the Games.
After the event, the system will supply 2000 apartments, housing around 6000 people, the China Daily reported.
The project is one of the co operative projects included in a Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Co operation signed between the Italian ministry and Beijing's municipal government in 2002.
It will "help Beijing fulfill its commitment to the Green Olympics," said Pei Chenghu, vice director of Beijing's Environmental Protection Bureau.
However, solar energy will not be the only energy source for the Olympic Village, and other energy supply systems are prepared, Clini said.
Since 2002, Italy has invested nearly 40 million euros (47 million US dollars) in helping Beijing improve its environment in 17 projects, the newspaper said.
The Portuguese government has granted an operating license for a huge solar energy power station that its backers claim will be the world's largest.
The Economy and Innovation Ministry said Wednesday it approved a project to install solar panels over 114 hectares (280 acres) in southeastern Portugal, one of Europe's sunniest spots.
The power plant, costing euro250 million (US$302 million), is to have a capacity of 62 megawatts when it comes on line in 2007.
The electricity it generates is to be fed into the national grid.
The project was developed by Amper Central Solar, a company 90 percent owned by the town council of Moura, where the plant is to be built.
The region is one of Europe's poorest.
BP Solar is to provide the panels and also will set up a nearby solar panel factory employing 115 people.
The factory is expected to achieve an annual turnover of euro63 million (US$76 million).
The government is encouraging the development of renewable energy sources to reduce the nation's dependence on imported oil.
Portugal has no oil, natural gas or coal.
It imports about 86 percent of its energy, according to government figures, and high oil prices are hindering efforts to revive the stagnant economy.
The United States has not joined the Kyoto Protocol to cut greenhouse gases, but the pact nevertheless is boosting sales for American companies that market "clean" energy technologies.
The spread of renewable energy standards particularly in Europe propelled by the treaty, along with a surge in oil and gas prices, havetriggered a boom in business for solar and wind energy companies.
When Solar Integrated Technologies Inc. opened an office in Germany last spring, for example, the salespeople were allocated enough solar roofing material to provide one megawatt of power.
In six weeks, they were sold out.
Within a month, they had orders for 16 megawatts more.
"It's a no brainer to do business in solar in Europe," said Jon Slangerup, chief executive of Solar Integrated, whose 120 employees are producing about one mile of solar roofing panels a week at a plant in South Los Angeles.
"The only question is: How much can you allocate and how fast can you install it?"
In Germany, the world's leading solar energy market, farmers are replacing crops with fields of solar panels, thanks to a government buyback program for renewable energy that spurred 150 percent growth in solar installations in 2004.
Britain, France and Spain also have introduced aggressive plans to reduce their production of carbon dioxide and other heat trapping gases over the next decade.
"Every available (solar) module is going to Germany," said Rhone Resch, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association in Washington, D.C. "It's Google like growth."
A world leader in renewable energy less than a decade ago, the United States is now viewed as a laggard.
At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Montreal this month, Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin accused the U.S. of lacking a "global conscience" for refusing to sign the Kyoto treaty, which requires developed countries to slash their greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels by 2012.
Craig Stevens, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Energy, said the Bush administration recognized that climate change was a "serious long term issue."
But he said the best way to address that concern was by developing cleaner, more environmentally friendly forms of fossil fuel generated energy and nuclear power.
Stevens said renewable energy would be an "important part" of the nation's energy mix, which was why the government was planning to invest $391 million next year in solar, wind, hydroelectric and geothermal energy projects.
State and local governments don't think the Bush administration is moving fast enough.
Twenty states have established standards to guarantee that a certain portion of the energy they use comes from renewable energy sources.
California is already the world's third largest market for solar energy and the nation's leading producer of wind generated power.
The state agreed earlier this month to spend an additional $300 million in subsidies to put solar energy panels on as many as 1 million rooftops over the next 11 years.
"California clearly has been a U.S. leader," said Ron Pernick, co founder of Clean Edge Inc., a West Coast energy consulting company that predicts that the market for solar photovoltaics, wind power and fuel cells will reach $15 billion a year by 2014.
Unless domestic production expands quickly, Californians hoping to jump aboard the solar bandwagon could face lengthy delays, according to solar experts.
They said the strong demand from Europe had taken up much of the U.S. production.
Investors are scrambling to get a piece of the renewable energy action, sending the stocks of California companies such as Solar Integrated and Clipper Windpower Inc,Both companies are listed on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market, where investors have shown a strong appetite for "green" companies.
Slangerup, who had just returned from a European investment tour, said governments in Europe were betting that having a strong renewable energy base would be a competitive advantage in the future.
(Begin optional trim) Solar Integrated produces a commercial roofing material that uses photovoltaic cells to produce about four watts of electricity per square foot.
Although it costs more to produce a kilowatt of electricity with this method, companies can use government subsidies to offset their capital outlays.
Those include a 30 percent federal tax credit on the cost of installation, rebates from the state and renewable energy credits that can be used to offset fees or fines.
"You turn a roof into a performing asset that has a guaranteed energy stream over 20 years," said Slangerup, whose customers include Coca Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc., Wal Mart Stores Inc. and commercial real estate developer ProLogis.
"It becomes a real powerful selling proposition."
He predicted that the cost of solar systems would drop by two thirds over the next five years, thanks to technical improvements.
(End optional trim) Rising natural gas prices have made wind technology another increasingly attractive option.
This year, wind power companies are expected to spend close to $3 billion installing 2500 megawatts of new capacity in the U.S., a 40 percent increase over the previous year, according to Patrick Caramante, vice president of U.S. operations for British based Garrad Hassan, one of the world's leading wind energy research companies.
Jim Dehlsen, founder of Clipper Technology, said, "The U.S. market has come to life," now that wind turbines can produce a kilowatt of electricity for 4.5 to 5 cents, compared with 9 to 9.5 cents for a new natural gas turbine project.
(Begin optional trim) Dehlsen's first entrepreneurial venture was Zond Corp., which was sold to Enron Corp. in 1997 and eventually ended up in the hands of General Electric Co. G.E. Energy is now the country's leading wind power provider.
Clipper Technology recently opened an assembly plant in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where Dehlsen expects to produce five of his high power Liberty wind turbines this year and 150 in 2006.
Those turbines, which are designed to operate even when wind is low, cost about $2.5 million each and can generate enough electricity over a 30 year life span to power 1250 homes.
(End optional trim) Some people complain about the visual blight and noise created by wind turbines.
But Dehlsen said wind power generation was far less damaging to the environment than fossil fuels, which produce high levels of greenhouse gases.
In addition, wind power could bring jobs to depressed farming and industrial areas.
Dehlsen said.
Germany, in less than six years, has installed enough wind projects to generate 14000 megawatts of power and employ 75000 people.
"The U.S. has a huge wind energy resource," he said.
"There are four states alone ,that could supply all of the electricity needs of the country."
Although most of his sales have been in the U.S., Dehlsen sees huge opportunities in Europe and the developing world.
He said he was negotiating deals in Eastern Europe, Latin America and China, with an eye on capturing 12 percent to 15 percent of the global market.
But Dehlsen and other renewable energy advocates said the lack of government support was threatening U.S. technological leadership, pointing to reduced support for the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colo., the primary provider of government research funds.
Stepped up interest from venture capitalists and Wall Street investors has provided seed money for entrepreneurs in the U.S.
But once they have mastered the technology, many companies are shifting their manufacturing to countries where governments are providing investment incentives and an assurance of long term demand.
The U.S. share of global production of photovoltaic cells has dropped from 45 percent in 1996 to 8 percent today, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.
Evergreen Solar Inc., one of the nation's leading solar companies, developed its modules at a facility in Marlboro, Mass., where it employs 250 people.
But the company sells three quarters of its product in Germany and plans to invest more than $50 million in a production plant there that will employ 400 people.
"We will eventually build a plant here in the U.S.," said Tim Woodward, a board member of Evergreen and managing director of Nth Power, a San Francisco based venture capital company.
"But the market demand is not great enough here for us to justify really expanding aggressively in the U.S.
market."
As prices for coal, natural gas and oil have soared, solar power has been getting perhaps its most serious look from investors since President Carter pulled on a cardigan and asked Americans to damp their furnaces.
The new interest means that the handful of domestic solar stocks has been surging, too.
Over the last year, the shares of Evergreen Solar, DayStar Technologies, Energy Conversion Devices and Spire all small domestic companies that make equipment for converting solar power into electricity have more than doubled in price.
In August, Cypress Semiconductor said it would try to raise as much as $100 million in an initial public offering for its SunPower subsidiary.
"The solar market is projected to grow 35 percent a year for the next three to five years," said Walter V. Nasdeo, managing director of Ardour Capital, an investment bank in New York that specializes in energy companies.
"As these technologies get better, we're seeing things being developed like solar panels integrated into roofing tiles.
That way, they don't look like a science project hanging on your roof."
Back in the days of Carter's cardigan, the country was mired in an energy crisis, with an oil embargo and long lines at gas stations.
Today, tumult in oil producing places like the Middle East and Venezuela is roiling markets.
Strong demand for electricity has contributed to increases in the prices of coal and natural gas.
And Hurricane Katrina, of course, has worsened the situation.
Yet these dire developments have been a boon for companies that make devices like silicon wafers and rooftop panels that convert solar energy.
Until recently, the economics of the solar business did not tempt many consumers or investors.
Without government or utility subsidies, the $20000 to $25000 that it costs to buy and install a typical home solar power system may be too high to be recouped at the end of a 30 year mortgage.
But government help, combined with the recent climb in energy prices, has made solar more appealing.
Some states offer big subsidies, helping to defray much of the initial cost of a home system.
Some electric utilities also offer incentives.
In theory, solar energy systems free them from having to invest in additional generating capacity.
Homeowners typically connect their systems to the power grid and buy electricity when their panels do not produce enough power, they sell electricity to their utility when they have a surplus.
Federal law requires utilities to buy excess power generated by consumers using solar power, although rates vary from state to state, said Joseph E. Schwartz, chief executive and technical editor of Home Power magazine.
And the new federal energy law, signed by President Bush last month, includes a tax credit of as much as $2000 for the purchase and installation of a residential solar power system.
"Despite all of the concerns about imported oil and climate change, most people make their decision to install solar based on whether they're going to save money," said Steven C. Taub, director of emerging power generation technologies at Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
In states with generous subsidies, he said, solar power may be attractive for many consumers.
In New Jersey, for example, subsidies can cover as much as 70 percent of the cost, leaving consumers with a net cost of about $6000 on a typical home system.
Though the four little domestic solar power companies stand to benefit from new demand for power, they account for only a fraction of the world's solar device production.
The biggest of the four, Energy Conversion Devices, has a market capitalization of only about $1.1 billion.
Giants like BP and Royal Dutch Shell in the energy industry, or Sharp and Kyocera in electronics, make most solar gear.
Last year, the solar industry produced 1195 megawatts of new electricity generation capacity, about the equivalent of one large power plant, Taub said.
Sharp alone accounted for about 325 megawatts, he said.
Yet solar energy conversion is a tiny part of these hefty companies' sales, so the little independents are a purer play.
The business lines of Evergreen and DayStar are almost entirely related to solar power (as are those of Cypress' SunPower).
Energy Conversion Devices has other products, but its largest subsidiary, United Solar Ovonics, also known as Uni Solar, is a solar power business.
And Spire's solar division accounted for an average of 40 percent of the company's sales in 2003 and 2004.
Of course, investing in small capitalization stocks can be risky.
Besides being microbes in an industry dominated by giants, none of the four independents were profitable last year.
Two have short histories as public companies: Evergreen went public in 2002, and DayStar did so last year.
All but Spire are developing new solar technologies, and there is no guarantee that customers will embrace their innovations.
Understanding their plans requires a bit of knowledge about the way solar power works.
The most popular means of converting the sun's energy into electricity silicon based solar panels has progressed over the last three decades but has not changed radically.
Silicon is used to make wafers, which are wired to create solar cells.
These form the building blocks for solar panels, which look like big storm windows as they sit atop roofs and soak up the sun.
A silicon shortage has driven up the cost of solar grade silicon by more than 60 percent over the last two years, said Michael Rogol, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia.
That offers an opportunity to companies like Evergreen and SunPower that have devised more efficient ways to use silicon, he said.
Evergreen's wafer making method consumes about a third less silicon than usual, said Richard M. Feldt, its president and chief executive.
Many competitors slice blocks of silicon into wafers, that creates waste in the same way a lumberyard spits out sawdust.
Evergreen's method, which draws out long ribbons of silicon and slices them with lasers, produces less waste.
Executives at Cypress Semiconductor in Sunnyvale, Calif., declined to be interviewed because of an impending stock offering.
But Rogol said its SunPower unit makes the industry's most efficient cells, yielding 210 watts of power a square meter, versus 180 for a typical cell.
DayStar, for its part, uses no silicon, while Uni Solar uses far less than average.
DayStar, based in Halfmoon, N.Y., applies a thin film of several elements, including copper, to backings such as titanium foil to create flexible solar cells.
Uni Solar marries the thin film method with silicon.
"Our panels are typically 18 feet long with an adhesive on the back," said Subhendu Guha, its president.
"You can stick it directly onto the roof.
With the traditional product, you have to have a support structure."
Spire, in Bedford, Mass., produces neither silicon wafers nor solar cells.
It makes machinery for building and testing solar panels.
In 1999, that enabled it to work with the city of Chicago to equip and run a panel factory there.
Roger G. Little, Spire's chairman and chief executive, says he sees the Chicago venture as a harbinger of Spire's future, he aims to increase panel production over the next two years.
That would return Spire to its roots.
The company started in 1969, early on, it concentrated on solar power conversion.
It diversified into biomedical equipment and electronics after the energy crisis of the late 1970s abated and enthusiasm for solar power cooled.
"The market tanked," Little recalled.
Even so, he remained confident.
"I've always believed that solar is a freight train that can't be stopped," he said.
"It started small, but the compound annual growth rate for the last 10 years has been 20 percent.
This year, there's a $10 billion worldwide market for systems."
Portugal, one of the most oil dependent nations in Europe, will begin work on the world's biggest solar energy power station next year, officials said Tuesday.
The plant will have 350000 solar panels spread over 114 hectares (280 acres) near the southern town of Moura and will be able to produce 62 megawatts, more than six times the largest existing solar power station in Germany.
"The construction of the station will begin in 2006, it is irreversible," Moura mayor Jose Maria Pos de Mina was quoted as saying by Lusa news agency.
The plant is expected to be completed in 2009 and will have a total cost of 250 million euros (307 million dollars).
It will be built by BP Solar, a unit of energy giant BP, and it is expected to create 240 permanent jobs in the southern province of Alentejo, one of Europe's poorest regions.
"This is a unique project and the world's most ambitious in terms of final capacity," said BP Solar commercial director for southern Europe, Francisco Conesa, according to Lusa.
Southern Portugal's thinly populated Alentejo region has been identified as one of Europe's most promising regions for solar energy.
The town of Moura owns the majority of the firm which will oversee the solar power station project, Amper Central Solar.
Under the United Nations Kyoto Protocol, the international treaty on global warming which Lisbon has signed, Portugal must generate 39 percent of its electricity needs through renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.
A team from Holland, known more for its windmills than its sunshine, on Wednesday won a four day international solar powered car race across Australia's deserts, notching up their third straight victory.
High tech cars from Australia, the United States and Japan were hot on its heels as the sliver shaped, space age Nuna 3 arrived in the southern city of Adelaide after the 3000 kilometre (1860 mile) race, organiser Chris Selwood told AFP.
Shunning petrol, sucking up the sun and racing at speeds up to 120 kilometres (74 miles) an hour, 20 cars from 10 countries set out from Darwin in Australia's far north on Sunday in the eighth World Solar Challenge.
The Dutch team behind Nuna 3 appeared to have broken its own record of 30 hours and 54 minutes set during the last race in 2003, Selwood said.
The "Challenge", to design and build a car capable of crossing Australia on the power of daylight, was launched in 1987 and teams and individuals from corporations and universities throughout the world take part.
Australian entry Aurora 101, which came second in the last two races, was holding on to the same position this year while a car from the University of Michigan, which won the North American Solar Challenge in July, was in third place, Selwood said.
A team from Ashiya University in Osaka, Japan, which qualified fastest with its Sky Ace Tiga car, was running fourth.
Tail enders still making their way through the vast Outback could reach the finish line a day later.
The teams raced from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm each day through some of Australia's most forbidding terrain on the main Stuart Highway from Darwin to Adelaide before camping each night where they were in the desert.
Event spokeswoman Rowena Austin said the challenge was an important testing ground for alternative fuel technologies.
"It's particularly relevant with the oil price where it is at the moment," she said.
Spain has provided a US$54.4 million (euro43.4 million) long term loan to fund a solar power project for remote villages in the central and southern Philippines, officials said Friday.
The four year project, which began in 2003, will initially cover communities that have benefited from the government's agrarian reform program in 16 provinces on the main southern island of Mindanao, acting Land Reform Secretary Nasser Pangandaman said.
The project will provide electricity for the first time to more than 277900 rural households, plus schools, potable water systems and health, village and livelihood centers, said Dioscora Tobias of the government's Solar Power Technology Support project.
The Philippines will provide a US$8.7 million (euro6.9 million) counterpart fund for the project, which will also help the country diversify its energy sources.
Tobias, who monitors and evaluates the solar power project, said it also will provide schools in remote areas with television sets and video players to be used as teaching aids.
A rural household with a solar panel installed typically will have enough electricity to power four light bulbs and backup batteries to provide power for a week of bad weather.
Health centers also will be provided with refrigerators for vaccines, Tobias said.
The first Saturday in October was clear, dry and drenched in bright sunlight ideal for the solar panels converting light to electricity at Harry Kubetz and Gary Burton's home in Northport, N.Y. "Today is a peak power day," Burton said, looking up at a rooftop covered with 80 solar panels.
"We're probably producing enough power to meet our demand for the day."
In fact, according to the digital meter on the side of the house, the panels were making more electricity than the house needed.
A small black arrow pointed left, indicating that excess electricity was being sent back to the Long Island Power Authority.
The Northport home was one of 67 stops on a solar energy tour across Long Island.
The free tour, set up by Renewable Energy Long Island, an alternative energy advocacy group, was self guided, covering residences and businesses with solar systems in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
Lower prices for solar equipment, higher efficiency and tax and rebate incentives from government and utility companies have caused more Long Islanders to look to lower their energy costs with solar power.
Over the last year, demand "has skyrocketed" for these systems, said Jonathan Lane, who owns Quad State Solar, the company that installed the system for Kubetz and Burton.
"Within the last three months, there has been a huge increase in the number of inquiries and in the number of sales," he said.
Another sign that prices are going down and demand is increasing is the lower rebate offered by the power authority.
Kubetz and Burton received $5 per watt for their 10 kilowatt system or $50000.
Their system cost $81000 to install.
Of that, a total of $27250 came out of their pockets after the rebate and a state tax credit of $3750, a maximum that will rise to $5000 in September 2006.
A federal tax credit of 30 percent of the cost of a solar system, up to $2000 for homes, will also apply after Jan 1.
But today, with 560 homes and businesses powered by solar energy on Long Island, the LIPA rebate is down to $4 per watt, and the utility expects to lower it further to $3.75 in mid to late 2006 if solar system prices continue to go down, said Daniel Zaweski, the director of energy efficiency and distributed generation programs at the power authority.
The average 5 kilowatt residential solar system costs nearly $40000 to buy and install, according to Gordian Raacke, director of Renewable Energy Long Island.
The homeowner would pay about $15000 after a $20000 LIPA rebate and state and federal tax credits.
Such a system can reduce electric bills by 20 to 100 percent, according to Sharon Laudisi of the Long Island Power Authority, depending on the amount and duration of sunlight hitting the solar panels and on electricity use in the home.
Solar energy systems, also called "PVs," short for photovoltaic cells, convert sunlight to electricity without combustion, creating power without pollution.
There are also solar systems for heating water and pools.
Solar panels do not store energy, and they supply electricity only when the sun is shining on them.
Since most homes have their solar systems connected to the LIPA grid, they draw energy back from the authority at night or on cloudy days, using the credits earned while supplying electricity during the day.
Kubetz and Burton like the modern look that the sleek reflective solar panels add to the back of their suburban ranch.
Besides saving about $2000 a year on utility bills, there's the matter of conscience.
"I could personally afford to pay a larger bill," Kubetz said, "but I think Americans consume way too much energy."
It was an invention just waiting to be patented.
With electronic devices hitting the trails, someone had to put on the market a neat, portable source of electricity.
Voila!
The solar backpack.
It sounds ungainly, but two companies have made a go of it.
Clear Blue Hawaii offers the Blue Sun Solarpac ($260, battery not included) and Voltaic Systems offers the Voltaic Backpack ($229, battery included).
Both can charge your GPS unit and other gadgets while you hike, bike or sit using an internal battery, and both can charge direct from the solar cells in daylight.
They are also the same size 1850 cubic inches.
But beyond these similarities, the packs are quite different, which can be challenging for the consumer.
First, Blue Sun's solar panel, batteries and harness can be removed and used with other Clear Blue Hawaii products, saving $200 on a second bag.
The same items in the Voltaic are fixed.
Second, while both packs operate with an internal lithium ion battery, each battery option is slightly different.
The Blue Sun can accept a $50 or $150 lithium ion battery, the $150 battery stores more electricity and has a wider output (up to 12 volts) than the $50 battery (up to 7.2 volts).
Voltaic's battery, which ranges from 3.5 to 7.2 volts, can't match Blue Sun's $150 battery in output or output range, nor can it match Blue Sun's $50 battery in overall output but bests it in output range.
Blue Sun's solar panel yields twice the power of Voltaic's three panels when tested in identical conditions.
In addition, the type of panel that Blue Sun uses is more energy efficient than Voltaic's monocrystalline panels.
All that said, given the fact that the Blue Sun has a better solar panel and batteries that yield more output, I would recommend the Blue Sun pack.
With its $50 battery, you can charge most of your hand helds, and if you purchase the $150 battery, you will be able to recharge a 12 volt device, such as a satellite phone.
But this recommendation assumes you've got your heart set on a solar backpack.
The truth is, the limited size of these packs makes them impractical for anything beyond overnight outings, where you could easily pack extra batteries to meet your electrical needs.
But on outings lasting a week or more, these packs could save users from having to haul 10 pounds or so in batteries (even though you couldn't use the packs because you wouldn't have enough space for the provisions you'd need).
When Clear Blue Hawaii and Voltaic Systems produce solar packs at least three times the size of these, they will have a product with real appeal to backpackers.
Until then, the Blue Sun and Voltaic backpacks are little more than novelty items with the promise of useful packs to come.
The solar power industry needed stability to become competitive, the Vice President of Royal Dutch Shell's Hydrogen Business Jeremy Bentham said here on Wednesday.
Jeremy Bentham told the World Petroleum Congress in Johannesburg: "The solar industry needs stable markets.
With fair and good incentives we can have solar power competitive in ten year's time."
He said over the course of time different companies gave different incentives to get markets moving, and that these incentives changed, upsetting the industry.
Reasons for countries to shift to renewable sources of energy included the need to preserve energy independence as well as the increase of air pollution in cities.
Renewable energy production would be on the same level as gas production by 2030, and as oil by 2040, Bentham predicted.
"We are not constrained by capital, but by opportunities as we grow," Bentham said.
Electricity generation from wind power was reaching its target of being competitive.
Turbines in the Thames estuary were providing electricity to a quarter of homes in the greater London area.
Bentham stressed that government policies would play a major role in advancing the use of renewable energy, and that fact based and not emotion based discussions were required around the issue.
With well developed wafer and semiconductor industries, Taiwan has great promise in solar energy development, the chief executive officer of Taiwan's leading crystalline silicon solar cell manufacturing company said Monday.
Speaking in an interview with CNA, Motech Industries Inc. President Leo Cheng said he urged the government to invest more in solar energy research when his company began investing in the field seven years ago.
"Taiwan is very suitable for solar power development because it has the world's best wafer fabrication plants and a large number of skilled engineers.
With this precious asset, I see no other country better equipped than Taiwan to develop solar energy," Cheng said.
In the past two years, Cheng said, more and more local companies have got involved in solar energy development, enhancing the possibility of forming a comprehensive industry supply chain.
"So long as we can develop a complete supply chain, the solar energy industry will become yet another of Taiwan's star industries like the electronics industry," Cheng said.
Motech Industries Inc., founded in 1981 and formerly known as Meter International Corp., is a leading Taiwanese manufacturer specializing in high end test and measurement instruments.
Over the past 20 years, Motech Industries has expanded its product base to become one of the most reputable test and measurement manufacturers in Taiwan, with a growing international presence.
In 1998, Motech received permission to set up its Solar Electricity Division (Motech Solar) in the South Taiwan Science Park.
Motech Solar is Taiwan's first manufacturer specializing in the production of crystalline silicon solar cells.
Its main products include multi and mono crystalline silicon solar cells with dimensions of 125mm x 125mm and 156mm x 156mm.
Cheng said Motech Solar plans to further expand its production capacity by the end of 2005.
Motech Solar has also started a pilot production line for wafer slicing to reduce cost and increase the supply of silicon wafers, Cheng said.
Moreover, Cheng went on, Motech Solar plans to begin the construction of a second factory building for future expansion in solar wafer and cell manufacturing.
"One of our goals is to become the lowest cost solar cell manufacturer in the world," Cheng said.
With the Kyoto Protocol taking effect and crude oil prices skyrocketing, Cheng said there is a resurgence of interest in solar energy.
As a result, upstream solar energy materials have been in short supply and he predicted that investment in upstream solar energy materials production will reap certain dividends.
He urged the government to invest more in solar energy research and provide incentives to encourage private investment in the field so that Taiwan can develop a complete solar energy supply chain soon.
Cheng further said his company is expected to rank among the world's top five solar energy firms by 2008.
Italy has unveiled Europe's first solar power train, according to Italian News Agency ANSA on Thursday.
The solar panels on the train's roof do not drive it but provide energy for its air conditioning, illumination and safety systems.
Italian Environment Minister Altero Matteoli said the first ten prototypes would pave the way for "significant" developments in the future.
The CEO of Italian train company Trenitalia, Roberto Testore, said it was "looking with interest to the solar power sector, with a view to producing vehicles on an industrial scale."
Solar panels are already used to provide a portion of train power in Japan.
A miniature railway in Wales is wholly powered by solar energy.
At Thursday's presentation, Testore also said Trenitalia was investing heavily to renew its fleet and raise safety levels.
He said the number of accidents had dropped by half in the last eight years.
Soaring energy prices and bright sunny days are giving new meaning to the gold in "Golden State."
On a day when their morning newspapers reported a projected 70 percent increase in natural gas bills, more than 160 central San Joaquin Valley residents spent Saturday checking out the possibilities of generating their own electricity through solar power.
As the sun pushed temperatures into the 80s and low 90s, these conservation minded citizens toured nine homes and two commercial locations that are converting sunlight to electricity through photovoltaic cells.
People taking the tour said they were concerned about rising energy bills and wanted to see how much money they could save by going solar.
"It's about cost and future costs," said Randy Neely of Fresno, when asked about his interest in solar energy systems.
"If the break even point for solar systems is 12 13 years in today's dollars, imagine what it's going to be in the future if the price of oil keeps going up."
Neely said that with the possibility of a solar power system paying for itself in fewer years, given the current energy price situation, he and his wife, Nola, are seriously considering installing photovoltaic roof panels on their next house.
"That's why the tour is so beneficial," said Nola Neely.
"You get to take a look at real homes and ask the homeowners what is good about their systems and what they wish they would have done differently."
Allen and Mary Jones of Fresno have long been aware of the benefits of solar power.
For years, Allen Jones has used a solar oven for cooking.
"I've been looking at solar power systems for a long time but so far I haven't seen the payoff," he says.
When he does, Jones says, he won't hesitate to go solar.
With energy costs on the rise, more and more people will be looking for ways to reduce their power bills, said Jeff Adolph of Fresno.
Adolph, the facilities energy manager for Pacific Gas and Electric Co., has done all he can to reduce his home energy bill, including taking advantage of PG&E's time of use rates, which are lower when electricity is not used from noon to 6 p.m. For years, Adolph's family has gone without air conditioning during hot summer afternoons.
"I'm looking into solar energy as a way to be a little more comfortable in the summer," he says.
Saturday's self guided solar home tour, the first of its kind in the central San Joaquin Valley, was sponsored by the city of Fresno, American Solar Energy Society, Northern California Solar Energy Association and the Great Valley Center.
Interest in solar energy is increasing rapidly in California, said Mark Stout, a clean energy consultant from Fresno and coordinator of the tour.
"In 2001, we were generating 10 megawatts of solar electricity in the state," he said.
"Today it's over 100 megawatts."
A megawatt is 1 million watts of electricity, or enough energy to power 300 homes.
Stout said there are some 500 solar electricity systems in operation in Fresno and Madera counties, up dramatically from a few years ago when there were just a handful of installations.
Given increasing electric rates, decreasing costs of solar panels and economic incentives available to homeowners through tax credits and rebates, Stout expects installations of solar power systems to increase rapidly in the next few years.
Using the sun to generate electricity is producing big energy savings for OK Produce, said general manager Brady Matoian, whose massive commercial solar power system drew several visitors Saturday.
In 2002, the company installed 35000 square feet of photovoltaic cells on the roof of its building in downtown Fresno.
The system, the largest of its kind in the Valley, has reduced energy consumption by nearly half and produced an annual savings of $65000.
Matoian participated in the tour as a way to help get the word out to people about the benefits of solar power.
"Solar energy works perfectly in the Valley," he said.
"We get nine months of sunshine every year.
Our agriculture is based on the sun.
What we're doing on the roof is farming the sun.
It makes perfect sense."
Two British newspapers said Tuesday they had paid unspecified damages to the singer once known as Cat Stevens over articles suggesting he had links to terrorists.
The musician, now known as Yusuf Islam, said The Sunday Times and The Sun had promised not to repeat the allegation and agreed to pay his legal costs and "substantial damages."
"It seems to be the easiest thing in the world these days to make scurrilous accusations against Muslims, and in my case it directly impacts on my relief work and damages my reputation as an artist," he said in a statement.
"The harm done is often difficult to repair.
However, I am delighted by the settlement, which helps vindicate my character and good name."
The Sunday Times and The Sun both confirmed they were making payments to Islam but declined to specify the amounts.
"There is an agreed settlement," said Richard Caseby, managing editor of The Sunday Times.
"The Sunday Times always denied liability and we disagreed with Cat Stevens' lawyers interpretation of the article, but we took a pragmatic view of the case."
Janet Anderson, a spokeswoman for The Sun, said Islam's statement was correct but declined to comment further.
The stories appeared in the newspapers in October.
The Sunday Times ran a correction in November saying it had not intended to suggest Islam supported terrorism.
"We wish to make it clear that he is not and never has been involved in any such activities and we accept that he abhors all forms of terrorism," it said.
The Sun also ran a correction.
Islam was removed from a London to Washington flight in September because American officials suspected him of links to terrorists, a charge he vehemently denies.
He said the U.S. government has still not told him what the accusation was based on.
Islam said he planned to use the money from the newspapers for aid projects he started to help children orphaned by the tsunami in Asia.
British foreign policy played a role in motivating the July 7 London bombings, former pop star Yusuf Islam said Tuesday.
Islam, who as Cat Stevens had a string of hits in the 1960s and 70s, said an al Qaida video claiming responsibility for the attacks and linking them to Britain's role in the Middle East showed that foreign policy "was not the only factor but it was a major contributory."
"At the same time we have to look at how the teaching of Islam has been distorted," he added.
Speaking at the opening of Cardiff University's Centre for the Study of Islam in the U.K., Islam said schools should teach young Muslims the true meaning of Islam to keep them away from extremist ideas.
"Right now there is a more vital role for education to play in painting a truer picture of Islam," he said.
"If you don't give it to the children in schools, anybody can give it to them on the streets or outside the normal environment for learning."
He also said Muslims should do more to integrate with British society.
"Coming to Islam from a Western background, I was slightly surprised early on by the insular approach," he said.
"I can understand it because many feel insecure and perhaps they weren't appreciated or were misunderstood.
"With a new generation of English speaking Muslims we have an opportunity to build many more bridges between the great faiths," he added.
Islam, whose songs include the 1971 hit "Peace Train," was removed from a London to Washington flight in September and ejected from the United States because American officials identified him as a security risk.
He says the U.S. government has still not told him the basis for the allegation.
Last November, he was awarded the "Man for Peace" prize in Rome by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who praised him for charity work and standing by his convictions despite personal hardships.
A New York bound British Airways plane was forced to change course over the Atlantic and head back to London Wednesday after US authorities said they would not allow one of its passengers to land, the airline said.
The Boeing 747, with 239 passengers aboard, was half way to its destination when it decided to return to Heathrow Airport at 1115 GMT "because of a passenger that the American authorities didn't want to land in New York," said a BA spokesman.
A police spokesman in London said the male passenger had been released by police after being questioned for two hours.
But a spokeswoman from the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said: "There was a person traveling on a French passport who was a positive match with an anti terrorism watch list.
"Homeland security made the match by checking data transmitted after the flight departed from London," Yolanda Clark added.
"As a precautionary measure, TSA contacted the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) and requested the aircraft be diverted to the nearest landing point to keep the plane from entering northeast corridor airspace.
That airport would be Bangor, Maine," she said.
"BA corporate made the decision instead to return the flight to London."
A BA spokesman said there was "no threat to the security of the aircraft and we took the decision to return to Heathrow."
An airline industry source who asked not to be named said it appears BA did not have the latest version of the no fly list.
This particular passenger was added in December.
Last December 26, a Delta Airlines plane was diverted to a Florida military airport after US authorities found similarities between the name of a passenger and that of a wanted terrorist suspect.
In November, An Air France Boeing 777 on a flight from Paris to Washington made an emergency landing in Bangor, Maine at the request of US authorities who wanted to question two passengers.
In September, British singer Cat Stevens, who converted to Islam in 1977 and changed his name to Yusuf Islam, was barred from entering the United States on national security grounds.
His plane was re rerouted to Bangor as he was flying with his daughter to Nashville, Tennessee.
Yusuf Islam, the pop musician known as Cat Stevens until he converted to Islam 30 years ago, was set to release a new record on Monday in aid of tsunami orphaned children in the Indonesian province of Aceh.
"The tsunami disaster has changed the world in an extraordinary way and it requires an extraordinary response from everyone," said the 56 year old, who sold 50 million records in the 1970s with hits such as "Matthew and Son", "Peace Train" and "Wild World".
The new song in response to the disaster, "Indian Ocean", features Magne Furuholmen of Norwegian group A Ha and Neil Primrose of Britpop band Travis.
The British singer's own charity, Small Kindness, set up a regional office in Indonesia and will work on projects "to keep families together" by helping orphans in the predominantly Muslim Aceh.
"We try to find other family members who would look after the orphans and then keep the family together in that way and then pay them subsistence every month," he said on his website.
The total number of tsunami victims is 273435 dead or missing, 220172 of them from Indonesia.
The thriller "Hide and Seek" (20th Century Fox), starring Robert De Niro, with Elisabeth Shue and Dakota Fanning, opened at No. 1 this weekend with an estimated $22 million in box office receipts, pushing last week's top film, "Are We There Yet?"
(Sony), with $17 million, to No. 2.
With two Golden Globe awards and seven Oscar nominations, Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" made a grand entrance into most U.S. markets this weekend with ticket sales of $11.8 million, the film opened in just over 2000 theaters on Friday, a big jump from the 147 screens it had played on since its limited release last month.
(On Saturday in Los Angeles, Eastwood won the top award from the Directors Guild of America, a prize closely watched in Hollywood as an indicator of the films and directors favored to win at the Oscars, on Feb 27.)
Rounding out the box office Top 5 were Paramount's "Coach Carter" (No. 4, with $8 million in receipts) and Universal's "Meet the Fockers" (No. 5, $7.6 million).
CATHERINE BILLEY A REPRIEVE FOR 'EASTENDERS' New York fans of "EastEnders," the British soap opera about a group of working class Londoners, have successfully raised the money required to keep the show on the air in New York for another year.
At the beginning of the month, WLIW, the Long Island PBS affiliate, announced it would cancel its broadcasts of the BBC series but would stay the execution if fans could raise $29000 enough to pay a year's licensing fees by Monday.
Led by Larry Jaffee, an Upper West Side resident and the publisher of a fan magazine about "EastEnders," supporters of the series held three fund raising events: a raffle, a viewing party at SoHo House and a get together with Michelle Collins, a former cast member.
Jaffee said the combined efforts raised $33692, which he would deliver to WLIW on Monday.
A spokeswoman for WLIW confirmed that the station would honor the agreement to continue broadcasting "EastEnders" for a year.
KATE AURTHUR A BEETHOVEN PREMIERE A fragment of an unknown piano concerto by Beethoven will have its premiere in Rotterdam, Netherlands, this week.
The eight minute adagio was written in 1789, when Beethoven was 19, and has been reconstructed by musicologists from the composer's notes, which were discovered in the British Museum, according to reports in the news media.
The first performance is Tuesday at the De Doelen concert hall, with the pianist Ronald Brautigam and the Rotterdam Chamber Orchestra.
In 2003 that orchestra accomplished another Beethoven feat, with the first performances in 160 years of a movement from a lost oboe concerto.
POP CDS IN RELEASE Except for one blockbuster album, the Game's "Documentary," January has been, as usual, a slow month for new music.
February looks a little more exciting, with new albums by Brian McKnight, 3 Doors Down, Tori Amos, Kings of Leon, Krayzie Bone and Iron and Wine.
Tuesday's new releases include the Chicago hip hop crew Do or Die's CD/DVD package "D(AST)O(AST)D" (Atlantic), produced by Kanye West, Scott Storch and others, the country singer Nanci Griffith's "Hearts in Mind" (Universal), with guest spots by Jimmy Buffett and Keith Carradine, Joe Cocker's "Heart and Soul" (Universal), with Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck, the Cowboy Junkies' "Open Road" (Rounder), the Italian born jazz singer Chiara Civello's American debut, "Last Quarter Moon" (Verve), and two releases by Seal: the new album "Acoustic" and a double disc collection, "Best: 1991 2004" (both released by Warner Bros.).
HONORING A CELTIC FIDDLER An impressive lineup of Celtic musicians will pay tribute this week to Johnny Cunningham, the Scottish born Celtic fiddler who died in December 2003.
His brother Phil Cunningham, an accordionist, will join the singer Susan McKeown, the fiddler Kevin Burke, the multi instrumentalist Seamus Eagan and the guitarist Aidan Brennan in a five city tour beginning in Sellersville, Pa., on Thursday and arriving at Town Hall in Manhattan on Saturday.
Johnny Cunningham had been a central figure in Celtic music for more than 30 years, in the group Silly Wizard, on his own and with McKeown, Burke and others.
FOOTNOTES The Grammy Awards ceremony on Feb 13 will include a tribute to Ray Charles with Bonnie Raitt and Billy Preston, the Recording Academy announced.
Trey Anastasio and Mike Gordon, both formerly of Phish, will perform, separately, at the Bonnaroo festival in Tennessee in June.
Anastasio will play with his new band, and Gordon will join the Benevento/Russo Duo.
Other additions to Bonnaroo's lineup include the German electronic group Mouse on Mars and the Appalachian string group Old Crow Medicine Show.
Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens, will be the host of a benefit concert for tsunami relief Monday in Jakarta, Indonesia.
The concert is to raise money for Aceh province, the severely damaged Indonesian region, and is to feature local musicians.
Islam is to perform a song, "Indian Ocean," written for the occasion.

Yusuf Islam, the pop musician known as Cat Stevens until he became a Muslim convert, will perform a concert in Jakarta next week to raise cash for tsunami disaster victims.
A statement on his website said Islam, who was deported from the United States last September out of being denied entry on "security grounds", would also open an office in Indonesia of his charity, Small Kindness.
Islam, who had hits in the 1970s with "Matthew and Son", "Peace Train" and "Wild World", will headline a concert featuring local performers on January 31.
"Like everyone else, I was so shaken by the enormity of this human tragedy, and the song just came without effort.
It is my contribution towards helping to rebuild the broken spirits of the victims of the disaster," he said in the statement.
He has also recorded a new song in response to the disaster.
"Indian Ocean" features Magne Furuholmen of Norwegian group A Ha and Neil Primrose of Britpop band Travis and is to be released next month.
The record makes use of musical instruments the singer has eschewed since 1977 when he embraced Islam, however, he said it did not represent a revival of his pop career.
"It's not a return to Cat Stevens, I see it more as a natural response to express my concern as a Muslim and as an artist, I believe both can exist side by side particularly when the cause is right," he said.
Islam will be one of the most prominent international artists to perform in the world's largest Muslim populated country for several months.
A string of big name acts, including Norah Jones, Missy Elliott and Alicia Keys, have all cancelled shows due to security fears in the wake of deadly bombings blamed on Islamic extremists.
Islam denied any link to terrorists last September when he was deported from the United States to Britain after his name appeared on a security watchlist when he was travelling on flight to Washington from London.
British religious and educational leaders were engaged Tuesday in debate over the growing trend of Islamic schools, after a chief government inspector warned they failed to prepare pupils for life in a diverse society.
Leaders of Muslim organizations balked at chief English inspector David Bell's assessment that traditional Islamic education offered by some schools was not suitable for the country's children.
But several officials at Islamic education bodies acknowledged the potential problem of students' social isolation, and said they were acting to address the problem.
Bell, the head of the Office for Standards in Education, or Ofsted, raised concerns about religious based schools in general, but singled out the rapidly growing number of Islamic schools.
"We must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation," he said in a speech on Monday.
"I worry that many young people are being educated in faith based schools, with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to British society."
Bell called on Islamic schools to promote "tolerance and harmony".
The inspector's comments touched off sensitive debate in Britain, which boasts a wide range of secular and religiously affiliated schools, including more than 100 Muslim schools in England.
The Islamiya Primary School of north London, founded by the former folk singer Cat Stevens, now known as Yusuf Islam, became the first Muslim school in 1995 to win the public funding long awarded to Protestant and Catholic schools.
Five of the Islamic schools are now state run, with the rest independent.
There are also more than 50 Jewish schools and about 100 Evangelical Christian schools.
Iqbal Sacranie, secretary general of the umbrella organization Muslim Council of Britain, said that while national cohesion was important it was "highly irresponsible to suggest that the growth of Muslim faith schools poses a threat to 'our coherence as a nation'."
The school inspector's comments were denounced as "Islamophobia" by Dr Mohamed Mukadam, chairman of the Association of Muslim Schools and principal of Leicester Islamic Academy in central England.
But Idris Mears, director of the same association, said Bell raised valid concerns.
"I don't think it's unfair of Mr Bell to bring the matter up.
Muslim schools are aware of it.
They're putting positive actions into place," he said.
Musleh Faradhi, head of the London East Academy, a new Islamic school, said he "agreed 100 percent with Mr Bell".
"You can't live in isolation, you have to interact with other people and understand other people and live with them, and if we don't teach our children that it would be a disservice," Faradhi told The Times newspaper.
The school head argued, however, that the same warnings applied equally to Jewish and Christian students.
Some Muslim leaders, including Sacranie, have called for state financing of more Islamic schools as a way of ensuring they maintain educational standards.
Bell agreed, adding that schools which remained independent must be "carefully but sensitively monitored".
About three percent of Muslim children in Britain attend Islamic schools, Sacranie said.
According to Britain's last national census in 2001, 2.7 percent of the population, or just under 1.6 million people, identified themselves as Muslim, mainly originating from South Asian countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are dealt with separately from England in terms of education.
Pop singer turned Muslim activist Yusuf Islam, formerly Cat Stevens, said Tuesday he had obtained "substantial" damages against two British newspapers which alleged he had been involved in terrorism.
In a statement released on his behalf, the 56 year old, who sold 50 million records in the 1960s and 1970s, said he had also received apologies for the "false and highly defamatory allegations".
The dispute was sparked by reports in the Sunday Times and Sun newspapers following the decision by US authorities in September 2004 to refuse Islam entry to the United States, on what was termed "security grounds".
Islam, who gave up music and changed his name 30 years ago when he embraced the Muslim faith, has repeatedly denied any involvement in terrorism, or terrorist funding.
Islam's settlement with the two papers saw them also agree to pay his legal costs and pledge not to repeat the allegations, his statement said.
"It seems to be the easiest thing in the world these days to make scurrilous accusations against Muslims, and in my case it directly impacts on my relief work and damages my reputation as an artist," he said.
"The harm done is often difficult to repair.
However, I am delighted by the settlement, which helps vindicate my character and good name."
The damages would be given to relief projects in areas hit by the December 26 Indian Ocean tsunami, he added.
One of Britain's most senior Muslim leaders said Thursday that he was denied entry to the United States without explanation, nearly a week after the deadly subway and bus attacks in London.
Dr Zaki Badawi, head of the Muslim College, told The Associated Press he was denied entry when he arrived in New York on Wednesday.
No explanation was given, he said.
He had been invited to speak at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, New York, where he planned to give a talk under the title "The Law and Religion in Society."
A spokeswoman for the Customs and Border Protection office in New York said when Badawi's flight from London to John F. Kennedy International Airport landed Wednesday, customs agents had information that showed he was "inadmissible."
Badawi then voluntarily withdrew his application for entry into the country, said Janet Rapaport.
Rapaport said privacy rules prevented her from disclosing the specific information that was used to bar Badawi and said she did not know what database the information came from.
She also said she did not know if last week's terrorist bombings in London had anything to do with barring Badawi.
A federal security official said Badawi was named on a U.S. terror watch list, but provided no further detail.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the information.
The U.S. Embassy in London did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
No explanation was given for his exclusion, Badawi said in a telephone interview.
"The people I was speaking to were very junior people, and they are just executing things they were told," Badawi said.
"They were very very embarrassed, and I felt sorry for them."
Badawi said he had visited the United States many times before, the last time in 2003.
On Sunday, Badawi joined other British religious leaders in condemning the bus and subway bombings.
He appeared with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor, Free Churches Moderator David Coffey and Chief Rabbi Sir Jonathan Sacks.
Azim Nanji, director of the Institute of Ismaili Studies in London and a participant in the Chatauqua conference, said he was "deeply saddened" by the exclusion of a "moderate voice."
"I felt it was very important that Americans should hear, particularly at this time, a voice from a leading British Muslim who is well respected by the British government, somebody they turn to for advice," Nanji said.
"Inviting the Dr Badawis of the world into that conversation is crucial," said Eboo Patel, founder and executive director of the Chicago based Interfaith Youth Core, who said he had come to hear Badawi.
"It's clear that a large segment of the Muslim community wants to be in a positive relationship with Western societies," Patel said.
"When representatives of that segment, people who have been knighted by the queen and are close advisers to the government, are rejected, it hurts our efforts at building multi faith societies and it gives grist to extremist Muslims who say, 'See, the West is against Islam, period.'"
Tom Becker, president of the Chautauqua Institution south of Buffalo in western New York, said he didn't know why Badawi was barred.
"Whatever it was some kind of misinterpretation of something," he said.
Badawi was given an honorary knighthood and in 2003 he was among the guests of Queen Elizabeth II at a state banquet for U.S. President George W. Bush.
Badawi said he was detained for about six hours.
"America is a lovely country.
There is no reason why it should behave like that," Badawi said.
In September, Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens, was ejected from the United States without explanation.
Islam's flight from London was forced to make an emergency landing in Maine when U.S. authorities discovered he was aboard.
Associated Press Writer Carolyn Thompson in Chautauqua, New York, contributed to this report.
Cat Stevens, who abandoned his music career when he converted to Islam and changed his name to Yusuf Islam 30 years ago, is making a surprise comeback with a single that could top the charts at Christmas.
Yusuf Islam, 56, who sold 50 million records in the 1960s and 1970s, has recorded a version of his 1970 hit "Father and Son" with Ronan Keating, the Irish former boy band star, The Times newspaper reported Thursday.
The bookmaker William Hill tipped the song Wednesday as the 7 1 favorite to become the Christmas No 1, it added.
As Cat Stevens, Islam enjoyed a string of hits including "Wild World" and "Moonshadow."
He converted to Islam after nearly drowning in California in 1976.
He avoided recording secular music, believing mistakenly, he now admits, that it was forbidden by the Koran.
He devoted himself to creating single faith Islamic schools in Britain but denies delivering funds to the Islamic militant group Hamas in Israel.
Islam has known Keating, a former member of Boyzone, for a decade.
A spokesman for Keating told The Times: "They first met ten years ago when Boyzone performed 'Father and Son' on 'Top Of The Pops' (on BBC television) and stayed in touch.
Ronan asked him to do the duet and he said yes."
Islams recent journey to Nashville, curtailed by the US authorities, was to discuss plans for a new album.
He is writing a Broadway musical based on his hits and sang at a charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London, his first live appearance in 25 years.
Islam has denied supporting terrorist organisations.
Islam was deported from the United States last month after being denied entry on "security grounds" and was released without charge.
Puzzled and angry at being barred from the United States, Yusuf Islam, the singer formerly known as Cat Stevens, returned to London vowing to find out why.
Surrounded by a throng of reporters at Heathrow Airport on Thursday, Islam said it was ludicrous that he's on Washington's no fly list, suspected of ties to terrorists, and said he would challenge the decision to block him from entering the country.
"Half of me wants to smile, and half of me wants to growl.
The whole thing is totally ridiculous," said Islam, who had a string of hits in the 1960s and '70s, but abandoned his music career after converting to Islam.
"Everybody knows who I am.
I am no secret figure.
Everybody knows my campaigning for charity, for peace.
There's got to be a whole lot of explanation."
Islam's United Airlines flight to Dulles International Airport was diverted to Maine's Bangor International Airport when U.S. officials reviewing the passenger list discovered he was aboard.
According to his Web site, the singer was last in the United States two months ago with his record company.
During a visit in May he met with officials of the White House Office of Faith Based and Community Initiatives "to talk about philanthropic work," according to White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan.
U.S. authorities provided few details about Islam's alleged connection to terrorism or when he was added to the watch list.
Homeland Security spokesman Brian Doyle would only say that the intelligence community has recently obtained information that "further heightens concern" about Islam.
"Yusuf Islam has been placed on the watch lists because of activities that could potentially be related to terrorism," Doyle said.
"It's a serious matter."
A second government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said U.S. authorities think donations from Islam may have ended up helping to fund blind sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, convicted for a plot to bomb New York City landmarks, and Hamas, a Palestinian militant group considered a terrorist organization by the United States.
British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw complained Wednesday to U.S. officials about their treatment of Islam, telling U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell "that this action should not have been taken," the Foreign Office said.
It was not clear whether Straw meant Islam's detention, or his inclusion on the watch list.
Islam, who was traveling with his 21 year old daughter, Maymanah, told reporters in London he was treated well by FBI agents.
He said he was bound for Nashville to "initiate some recordings."
Islam said he had been well treated by U.S. officials.
"The one positive thing I can say is that a lot of security officers are pleased because they got my autograph," he said.
"People make mistakes.
I just hope they made a big mistake.
We'll see," he said.
A statement on Islam's Web site said he was seeking further information from U.S. authorities "so that we can challenge the decision to refuse him entry."

US authorities on Monday urged airlines to step up their passenger security checks, after a Washington bound Air France flight from Paris was diverted when US officials learned that a passenger was in their "no fly" list.
US authorities asked that the Boeing 777 carrying 263 people be diverted to Bangor, in the northeastern state of Maine, late Saturday after discovering that a passenger was on the list of people deemed a security risk.
"We want the airlines to be more diligent about doing the checks," US Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security Asa Hutchinson said after a meeting with EU officials.
Hutchinson recalled that US authorities were preparing to test a new system dubbed "Secure Flight" that will allow them to compare the list of passengers with the no fly list.
"We need urgently the new system of Secure Flight to avoid" incidents like the one that occurred Saturday, he said.
He added that the number of people barred from entering the United States has sharply increased.
A similar incident involving British singer Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens, occurred in September, when his Washington bound flight from London was diverted to Bangor.
The singer, who gave up his successful pop career in the late 1970s and converted to Islam, was deported back to Britain after being denied entry into the United States on security concerns.
US authorities diverted a Washington bound Air France flight after discovering that a passenger was part of a "no fly" list of people deemed a security risk, a US security official said Sunday.
The flight was diverted to Bangor, in the northeastern state of Maine, late Saturday, said Transportation Security Administration spokeswoman Yolanda Clark.
US Customs officials took the passenger into custody, as well as a person who was traveling with the passenger on the no fly list, Clark said.
"The flight was diverted after it was learned that a passenger on the no fly list was onboard the aircraft, so out of an abundance of caution TSA took swift action to divert the flight to Bangor, Maine," she said.
The flight landed in Maine at 5:30 pm (2000 GMT) and headed back to Washington's Dulles International Airport two hours later, Clark added.
The Boeing 777 had 263 passengers on board, an Air France spokeswoman said.
A similar incident involving British singer and peace activist Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens, occurred in September, when his Washington bound flight from London was diverted to Bangor.
The singer, who gave up his successful pop career in the late 1970s and converted to Islam, was deported back to Britain after being denied entry into the United States on "security grounds."
Time magazine reported that Islam's deportation was caused by a spelling mixup over the name of "Yusuf Islam" on his passport and a certain "Youssouf Islam" who is on US watch lists.
Midway through live analysis of the presidential debate on "The Daily Show" on Thursday night, the host, Jon Stewart, called on his "correspondents" in the field for some in depth analysis.
"Ed, how are the Kerry people feeling?"
"Ecstatic, Jon," came the response.
"Kerry's people couldn't be happier.
Their candidate went up against a sitting war president who's never lost a debate and held his own."
"OK," Stewart said.
"And Rob, what's the mood at the Bush camp?"
"Triumph, Jon," the correspondent said.
"Orgasmic triumph.
Their man faced off against John Kerry, a golden tongued virtuoso of words and captain of the Yale debate team.
He's been honing his oratorical skills since the age of 3, and the way they see it, by not allowing himself to be reduced to tears, the president was the big winner tonight."
The exchange which ended with the Bush campaign "correspondent" pleading "You gotta re elect him!" was a clever evisceration both of the shallowness of campaign spin and of the news media's capacity for buying that spin, and ran on Comedy Central the same evening when the campaign spin doctors were earnestly toiling away on other networks.
Just to make sure there was no misunderstanding, during a commercial break, Stewart offered a reminder to the guffawing audience in his studio on West 54th Street.
"Remember," he said gravely.
"We are not actual newspeople."
Fake news is certainly the comic trope of the moment.
Besides "The Daily Show," Ali G uses the news talk show format to absurd ends, mocking politicians, celebrities and panels of self proclaimed experts.
The humorist Andy Borowitz files daily stories in perfect news service deadpan on his Web site, www.BorowitzReport.com.
The phony newspaper The Onion is expanding its print operation to new cities.
And in a strange turnabout, mainstream news outlets have been clamoring to introduce news satire to their programming, never mind that mainstream news is often what is being mocked.
The ABC news magazine "Prime Time Live" recently began closing the program with a two minute musical rendition of satirical headlines.
Mo Rocca, formerly of "The Daily Show," played the role of wisecracking on air correspondent for "Larry King Live" during the political conventions.
And Borowitz is a regular on CNN and appears alongside straight faced legal experts on Court TV.
"Today I spent an hour on Court TV talking about the Peterson case, and I don't know anything about the Peterson case," Borowitz said on Wednesday.
"It's perfectly appropriate on mainstream news shows now to have a satirist in the mix."
Satirists, perhaps not surprisingly, are loath to talk earnestly about what they do, Stewart is particularly averse to speaking seriously about humor.
But when pressed, most say their opening has come because of a polarized electorate that suspects the media of doing the other side's bidding, coupled with high profile journalistic scandals.
Let down, perhaps, by the mainstream media, 21 percent of people under 30 say they are learning about the campaign from satirical sources like "The Daily Show" and the late night television monologues, up from 9 percent in 2000, according to a Pew Research Center study released in January.
Comedy Central mocked CNN's motto "The most trusted name in news" and Walter Cronkite's onetime reputation (as America's most trusted man) on a billboard during the Republican National Convention, which proclaimed "The Daily Show" as "the most trusted name in fake news."
"This is big because there is this gigantic imbalance and something has got to fill it," said the cultural critic Neal Gabler, who is obsessed with "The Daily Show."
"Young people get the attitude, the deflationary truth telling attitude of these shows because they can't find it elsewhere," he said.
Rocca agreed.
"The premise of any joke delivered by oddball newscasters is that they're making fun of the media's treatment of news as much as they are the subjects of the news," he said.
"And if there's one thing that everyone can agree on, it's that, right or wrong, they hate the press."
Once they have the audience's sympathies, fake news purveyors have a simple task: be funny.
"A well told joke that has a Republican target, if it's clever enough, gets Republicans to laugh too," Rocca said.
News satire of course is a time tested gag.
Mark Twain wrote fake news stories, and they were a staple of The National Lampoon in the 1970s.
The television era has produced a steady supply of news spoofs like "Not Necessarily the News," "That Was the Week That Was" and "Weekend Update" on "Saturday Night Live."
But even the satirists themselves confess to being surprised by the sudden market for their craft.
"When I got out of school everyone wanted to write for sitcoms," Borowitz said.
"The idea that you could have a career as a prose satirist.
It's hard to imagine that even five years ago."
The latest evidence of the shift: "America (The Book)" by Stewart and "Daily Show" colleagues, a spoof of a civics textbook, will appear as No. 1 on the New York Times nonfiction best seller list of Oct 10.
Of course no self respecting satirist would take credit for anything so profound as affecting the political discourse, or even to having a political point of view.
Asked about the politics of writers for "The Daily Show," Ben Karlin, the executive producer, insisted, "We have no agenda other than holding on to our cushy, high paying, basic cable jobs."
As for the Pew study crediting shows like his for teaching a fifth of young Americans about politics, Karlin said he was dubious.
For one thing, he said, the audience could not possibly get the jokes if it did not already know the news stories that were being spoofed.
"People are getting their news from the tops of taxi cabs, from sluglines on Yahoo and from accidentally stopping on CNN," he said.
The hyped up news cycle has been a boon to the fake news racket.
For one thing, there is a steady flow of new material.
And for another, a more informed public means a bigger potential audience.
When Cat Stevens was barred from entering the country late last month after showing up on a terrorist watch list, Borowitz said he sat down to write a fake news story about it.
"You don't have to start by saying to the audience, 'See, there was this singer songwriter from the '70s named Cat Stevens,"' he said.
"In comedy parlance that was called the set up.
Now you can go straight to the punch line."
(Borowitz came up with "Angry Cat Stevens Vows to Resume Singing: Broadcasts Threat on Al Jazeera.")
On its most basic level, news satire derives its humor from the juxtaposition of earnest newspeak and the absurd.
"Nothing is more serious and pompous than a network news anchor or the earnest prose style of a newspaper," Borowitz said.
"The parody of the style becomes a joke in and of itself."
The form of news satire on "The Daily Show" is more sophisticated, mocking not just the style of the news but the conventions of journalism, for example, the mainstream news media's fixation with fairness.
"There's some weird handcuffs on the mainstream news so that they feel that no matter what, they have to present both sides of the argument, even if one side of an argument is wrong," Karlin said.
"The idea that we give the guilty an equal opportunity to defend themselves we have no idea why."
On one fake newscast, Stewart asked a correspondent in the field for his opinion on the Swift Boat veterans claims against Sen John Kerry.
"My opinion?" the reporter responded.
"I don't have opinions.
I'm a reporter, Jon.
My job is to spend half the time repeating what one side says, and half the time repeating the other.
Little thing called objectivity, might want to look it up."
Although he is coy about his politics, Stewart seems to relish mocking conservatives more than liberals, and at his studio on Thursday night, the crowd of people in their 20s, divided almost evenly between men and women, made no secret of their distaste for President Bush while watching the debate on monitors before the show began.
On Friday, Michael Hoyt, the executive editor of the Columbia Journalism Review, said that in some ways Stewart was providing a counterbalance to the conservatism of the Fox News Channel.
"People are hungry for some sort of attitude and guidance through an ocean of spin," he said.
"Fox supplies it in one way, and Jon Stewart in another.
Both are reactions to distorted objectivity, what I call a phony objectivity.
They are pieces of the same puzzle."
Gabler said, "It's a form of humor that subverts media convention and reveals the pomposities and idiocies of politicians, but even more the pomposities and idiocies of the media that covers the politicians."
All of which begs the question: What are programs like "Larry King Live" and "Prime Time Live" hoping to accomplish by bringing news satirists on board?
Rocca's antics on "Larry King Live" during the conventions this summer, while occasionally funny, only highlighted the staid nature of the broadcast, and for his part, King seemed not to know how to react, other than to laugh a bit too zealously at Rocca's wisecracks.
Shelley Ross, the producer of "Prime Time Live" who came up with the idea to do the musical news satire gag on her program, inspired by "That was the Week That Was" in the 1960s, said she felt satire was a proper response to searching times.
"It represents a healthy society," she said.
For his part Rocca said he considered his satirical bits a kind of public service.
"Television newscasts are so calcified and rigid, any departure from that is exhilarating," he said.
"And five minutes of good satire is a lot more useful than an hour on J.Lo's baby shower."
When it comes to the intense rock of Chevelle, don't confuse the band's roiling energy with anger.
Don't mistake introspection for depression.
And, don't mistake the trio for "Christian rockers," as critics and industry execs in the past have tried to tag them.
"It's not only a label we didn't want, it's untrue," Joe Loeffler, bassist and vocalist, said by phone recently.
"It's kind of frustrating, because we deal with it so much.
"With us, really, there's no label you can apply, it's so difficult to."
And there's no need to, he added.
Just as well.
Ask Loeffler and his bandmates/siblings Sam and Pete to list the music that influenced the band's sound, and they'll list Helmet, Tool, Sinead O'Connor and Yusuf Islam the artist once known as Cat Stevens and most recently in the news as being on the United State's no fly list for alleged ties to terrorism, an accusation the artist vehemently denies.
"My favorite artist, probably because of her stability, in doing what she tries to do record after record, is Enya," said Joe Loeffler, 24.
And what links such an eclectic mix to Chevelle?
"It's pretty cheesy, but the thread is, it's good music," Loeffler said.
That, and passion.
"Music is so much feeling and emotion," he said.
"A lot of those artists Cat Stevens and Sinead and Helmet that's emotion.
It's not crap, writing 'happy' songs for people.
It's making music with emotion."
Chevelle has been living by that simple creed since first forming in Chicago in 1995.
The band Sam, 29, mans the drums, and Pete, 27, handles guitars and vocals ripped through local clubs for four years before releasing its debut album, "Point .1."
In 2002, the brothers hit the big time with the release of "Wonder What's Next" and its chart topping single, "Send the Pain Below."
The latest offering, "This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In)" came out in late September and peaked so far at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 album chart.
Like its predecessors, it carries rich melodies dotted by guitar riffs and lyrics that probe issues from Ritalin use to the incessant demands of society lyrics some see as dark.
"From our side, it's not dark," Loeffler said.
"It seems like energy, like powerful.
Some songs are angry, some are more kind of emotional.
That's not dark to me.
"It's not like we're a freakin' hardcore band, with the repetitive screaming.
I don't think we're very angry."
Nor Christian rockers.
Or, for that matter, any "type" of rocker.
"Good music doesn't have to have a name on it," Loeffler said.
"That sounds cheesy, but it's true."

The singer once known as Cat Stevens, now a peace activist whose name was on a U.S. list of people suspected of having terrorist links, will receive a peace prize from a foundation headed by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, organizers said Monday.
The singer, now named Yusuf Islam, is expected to attend the ceremony on Rome's Capitoline Hill on Wednesday, said Enzo Cursio, a spokesman for the Gorbachev Foundation.
Islam will receive the award from Rome Mayor Walter Veltroni and Gorbachev, the spokesman said.
In September, the British musician was expelled from the United States after authorities diverted his London to Washington flight to Maine to remove him, saying he was suspected of ties to terrorism.
He says he was a victim of an "unjust and arbitrary system," and that he has denounced terrorism.
The "Man for Peace" award was being given to Islam "for his dedication to promote peace, the reconciliation of people and to condemn terrorism," said a press release by the Gorbachev Foundation and Rome's City Hall.
The ceremony Wednesday will mark the opening of the fifth reunion of Nobel Peace Prize laureates, a meeting organized every year in Rome by the Gorbachev Foundation.
The reunion ends Friday.
Other recipients of the "Man for Peace" award include Italian actor director Roberto Benigni, who won in 2002.
Benigni is the director of the Oscar winning "Life is Beautiful."
Nelson Mandela, South Africa's former president and apartheid hero, donned his former prison identification number 46664 on Thursday for a fundraising event aimed at fighting the AIDS/HIV epidemic.
The 86 year old Mandela, wearing 46664 on a black shirt, oversaw the launch of the book "46664: The Concert", a book of photographs taken at an AIDS benefit concert last year.
"This book is a record of that amazing night,that raised awareness and inspired the fight against AIDS," the Nobel peace prize winner told a London audience.
He was joined at the event by British music stars Annie Lennox, Brian May from the group Queen, Peter Gabriel and Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens.
Mandela has lent his prison number 46664 to AIDS campaigns, for the first time last November at the rock concert in Cape Town.
"Not only governments and the drug companies, but we too have a responsibility to act. Each of us must do more.
Do more to educate each other about the facts of infection and how to prevent it," he told the London book launch.
"We are all leaders now, and good leaders must lead.
The fact is that every HIV infection can be prevented and every AIDS case can be treated."
Mandela, the world's most respected statesman, is also fighting legally to keep his name and his number from being used by businesses that have nothing to do with him or the AIDS campaign.
Mandela's foundation recently discovered, when trying to obtain a telephone number with the 46664 digits, that a Johannesburg based coin dealer Investgold ICC had already beaten them to the punch.
South Africa's first black president from 1994 to 1999, Mandela has also built a charity empire that includes his Nelson Mandela Foundation and two other smaller organizations, the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund and the Mandela Rhodes scholarship foundation.
The government ordered U.S. airlines Friday to turn over personal information about passengers so it can test a system for identifying potential terrorists.
The move was expected but nonetheless brought protests from civil libertarians worried about invasions of privacy.
Under the system, called "Secure Flight," the Transportation Security Administration will compare passenger data with names on two government watch lists: a "no fly" list comprises known or suspected terrorists, and a "watch" list names people who should face tighter scrutiny before boarding planes.
"Secure Flight represents a significant step in securing domestic air travel and safeguarding national security information, namely, the watchlists," the TSA said in a notice announcing the order.
The TSA order gives 72 airlines until Nov 23 to turn over computerized data for passengers who traveled on domestic flights during June.
The data known as passenger name records, or PNR can include credit card numbers, travel itineraries, addresses, telephone numbers and meal requests.
The latter can indicate a passenger's religion or ethnicity.
Barry Steinhardt, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer, said a major problem is the lists include the names of many people who are not security risks.
Among those subjected to extra scrutiny in recent months was Sen Edward M. Kennedy.
The singer formerly known as Cat Stevens, now Yusuf Islam, is trying to get off the no fly list after he was removed from a London to Washington flight because the list said he had links to terrorists.
The lists are "a hodgepodge of information, accurate and inaccurate," Steinhardt said.
"They're the basement of the program, and the floor is rotten."
The government has sought to improve its process for checking passengers since the Sept 11, 2001, hijackers exposed holes.
The government's first attempt was scuttled because of fears the government would have access to too much personal information.
The TSA says Secure Flight differs from the previous plan because it does not compare personal data with commercial databases.
The agency said, however, it will test the passenger information "on a very limited basis" against commercial data.
Under the current system, the government shares parts of the watchlists with airlines, which are responsible for making sure suspected terrorists don't get on planes.
But the airlines don't have access to everyone who's considered a threat to aviation because some of the names of known or suspected terrorists are classified.
People within the commercial aviation industry say there are more than 100000 names on the lists.
Under Secure Flight, the government would take responsibility for checking passengers.
That was among recommendations of the commission that investigated the Sept 11 attacks.
An airline industry representative said the carriers support the government's goals but remain wary of privacy concerns.
"U.S. airlines have long standing concerns that center on privacy and operational issues," said James May, president of the Air Transport Association, which represents major airlines.
"We hope many of the issues will be successfully addressed during the test phase of Secure Flight."
In issuing the order, the TSA didn't resolve another key concern for privacy advocates: redress.
There still is no formal way for people mistakenly identified as terrorists, or who have the same name as a suspected terrorist, to get off the lists.
Justin Oberman, who heads the TSA office that's developing Secure Flight, said the agency will set up a passenger advocate's office to handle complaint from passengers.
He said a process of redress wasn't needed until Secure Flight begins.
Oberman said the TSA will present the final plan for Secure Flight early next year.

The International Committee of the Red Cross insisted Friday that Britain does not hold any women prisoners in Iraq, although the demand of militants holding a British man hostage is that female prisoners be freed.
The ICRC added that it was ready to act as a mediator to help free Kenneth Bigley.
The British government said more than 100000 leaflets had been distributed in Baghdad containing a personal plea from Bigley's family and an appeal to his captors to release him.
Bigley, an engineer, was kidnapped two weeks ago in Baghdad along with two American colleagues who have since been beheaded.
The Islamic militants claiming responsibility for Bigley's abduction have demanded the release of female Iraqi prisoners.
The British government has repeatedly stressed that it does not hold any.
The U.S. military says it has two Iraqi women in custody Rihab Rashid Taha, a scientist who became known as "Dr Germ" for helping Iraq make weapons with anthrax, and Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash, a biotech researcher dubbed "Mrs Anthrax."
The ICRC, which visits prisons around the world to monitor the condition and treatment of prisoners, told The Associated Press that it had repeatedly visited Britain's sole detention facility in Iraq, near the southern city of Basra.
"We have repeatedly visited Shaiba, the only British detention place in Iraq.
There are no women detained there," said Rana Sidani at the ICRC in Geneva, Switzerland.
Sidani said the ICRC did not have any contacts with the militant group, controlled by Jordanian terror mastermind Abu Musab al Zarqawi, believed to be holding Bigley.
"We stand ready if we are contacted to mediate," she added.
Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Thursday that Britain would not pay a ransom or meet any political demands to secure Bigley's release.
"If we did not have this position there would be many, many more people who would be kidnapped, and the world would be less safe," Straw told British Broadcasting Corp. television.
The Foreign Office said Friday that leaflets had been distributed in the streets around 28 mosques in Baghdad.
They contained messages from Bigley's family and from prominent British Muslims, including Yusuf Islam, the singer once known as Cat Stevens.
"I request you, in the name of Allah ,to release the British citizen Ken Bigley for the good name of our religion and according to the sayings of Allah in the Glorious Quran," said Islam, who was taken off a Washington bound plane last month and expelled from the United States after his name turned up on a list of people suspected of having terrorist links.
Britain has complained to the United States about the treatment, and Islam has said he plans legal action against U.S. authorities.
"Our religion Islam does not allow us to harm the innocent," said the Muslim Council of Britain's Iqbal Sacranie in the leaflet.
"We urge you to please listen to this appeal and release this man back into the arms of his waiting family."
Houston Mayor Bill White on Wednesday urged residents in low lying areas to leave the path of powerful Hurricane Rita as it churned toward Texas.
"Hurricane Rita on its present course poses a risk to Houston and the whole Houston region," White told a press conference in Texas.
"We are asking all residents in the Houston area and the greater Houston area that are in the storm surge area for a hurricane of this force and above to begin making their evacuation plans.
"We are calling for volunteer evacuations from several different areas.
First, those areas that are in the storm surge areas.
"Second, if you are in a 100 year flood plain, in an area that has experienced flooding in the past, those include many areas along some of the major bayou waterways.
We want you to voluntarily evacuate and make your plans for voluntary evacuations now and implement those plans."
He also urged those in mobile homes to evacuate.
Rita, packing winds of 215 kilometers (135 miles) per hour, was upgraded to a category four storm on the five level Saffir Simpson intensity scale as it bore down on Texas, where inhabitants of Galveston were ordered to flee the city.
Oil prices were higher in Asian trade Wednesday as Hurricane Rita pounded the Florida Keys islands before barreling into the Gulf of Mexico where much of US production is sourced, dealers said.
At 12:30 pm (0430 GMT), New York's main contract, light sweet crude for November delivery, was up 1.28 dollars at 67.48 dollars a barrel from its close of 66.20 dollars in the United States Tuesday.
"Now it is all about Hurricane Rita," said Victor Shum, an analyst with US energy consultancy Purvin and Gertz in Singapore.
"That is driving up prices at the moment," he said.
Rita, expected to become a major storm, was tracking a path that could roughly follow that of Hurricane Katrina into the Gulf of Mexico where about one quarter of US oil operations are based.
The path, while still uncertain, could take the powerful new storm toward Texas or possibly Louisiana, where it would likely inflict further damage on the US energy industry.
Gulf of Mexico production has only been starting to recover from the shutdown caused by Katrina late last month.
Now with Rita approaching, more than 58 percent of crude oil drilling and about 35 percent of natural gas production has been suspended, according to US government figures Tuesday.
The US government also said 46 oil platforms had been destroyed by Katrina and 20 severely damaged while several refineries remain shut.
Just the fear of Rita moving into the region sparked a jump of about seven percent in crude oil futures on Monday, while gasoline futures spiked 14.4 percent.
There was some pullback in prices Tuesday but the markets remained nervous.
"There are many facilities around Houston, especially natural gas facilities, offshore rigs and underground pipeline systems," said Mike Fitzpatrick, analyst at Fimat USA.
More than 70 percent of US oil production in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut down because of the threat of Hurricane Rita and the aftermath of Katrina, authorities reported Wednesday.
More than 57 percent of manned offshore plaforms and 51 percent of rigs in the area were evacuated, the Department of Interior's Minerals Service (MMS) said.
"Todays shut in oil production is 1097357 BOPD (barrels of oil per day)," MMS said, adding that this represented 73.16 percent of the US production of 1.5 million barrels per day in the Gulf of Mexico.
A total of 469 manned platforms, out of 819, and 69 of the 134 rigs were evacuated.
MMS said the statistics reflected evacuations and shut in production from both Katrina and Rita.
US meteorologists on Wednesday upgraded Hurricane Rita, which roared into the oil rich Gulf of Mexico after slamming Cuba and the Florida Keys islands, to a more powerful Category Three category on the five level hurricane intensity scale.
At 0600 GMT Wednesday Rita packed winds of 185 kilometers (115 miles) per hour, officials at the Miami based National Hurricane Center reported.
"Additional strengthening is forecast during the next 24 hours," the Hurricane Center said in an advisory, "and Rita is expected to become a Category Four hurricane sometime later (Wednesday)."
Rita's center was located some 235 kilometers (145 miles) west of Key West, Florida, and about 210 kilometers (130 miles) northwest of Havana, and was moving west in the direction of the Texas coastline at a speed of around 22 kilometers (14 miles) per hour, according to the Hurricane Center.
The hurricane left more than 24000 homes without power in Florida, sent street signs and coconuts flying and flooded parts of the only road that links the Florida Keys to the mainland.
Cuba set up 600 shelters in Havana and Civil Defense reported 230000 evacuees, including 12000 foreigners in the tourist area of Varadero.
Hurricane warnings were in effect around Havana and western provinces.
In Louisiana, still recovering from Hurricane Katrina's August 29 hit, authorities were keeping a close eye on Rita, and New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin suspended the return of the city's residents because of the new threat.
British energy giant BP said on Wednesday that it was evacuating staff from Gulf of Mexico oil facilities, after a similar move by Royal Dutch Shell, as Hurricane Rita approached the region.
"We have evacuated all non essential personnel to ensure their safety," a BP spokeswoman said.
BP said it has removed half of its 1500 employees working at its offshore facilities in the eastern and central parts of the Gulf.
Anglo Dutch energy giant Royal Dutch Shell has meanwhile removed some 545 staff from its platforms since Sunday.
"We will continue to monitor the situation closely and respond to further developments," a Royal Dutch Shell statement said.
Rita which strengthened to hurricane status on Tuesday was tracking a path that could roughly follow that of recent Hurricane Katrina into the Gulf of Mexico, where about one quarter of US oil operations are based.
Hurricane Rita, already an "extremely dangerous" storm continued to gain strength Wednesday and could reach top intensity before it hits land, probably in Texas, the US National Hurricane Center said.
"Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 140 mph (224 kilometers per hour) with higher gusts," said Lixion Avila, a forecaster with the Miami based NHC. "Rita is an extremely dangerous category four hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale.
Some additional strengthening is forecast during the next 24 hours and could reach category five intensity in the central Gulf of Mexico," he said.
Forecasters believe the storm will make landfall in Texas over the weekend, but do not rule out it may hit further east on the Louisiana coast.
Texas officials on Wednesday urged voluntary evacuations of residents from areas that could lie in the path of powerful Hurricane Rita as it churned ominously toward their state.
"Though Rita may weaken to a Category Four storm from that Category Five by the time it hits the shore, it is quite likely it will be a devastating storm when it reaches Texas.
That's why I'm encouraging coastal residents from Corpus Christi to Beaumont area to voluntarily evacuate if they have the means," Texas Governor Rick Perry said.
President George W. Bush meanwhile urged people to heed local authorities' evacuation orders.
"Mandatory evacuations have been ordered for New Orleans and Galveston.
I urge the citizens to listen carefully to the instructions provided by state and local authorities.
And follow them," Bush said.
"We hope and pray that Hurricane Rita will not be a devastating storm.
But we got to be ready for the worst."
Rita, the second big hurricane in less than four weeks, has strengthened to a category four storm on the five level Saffir Simpson scale and is headed toward the US Gulf Coast.
The death toll from last month's Hurricane Katrina rose above 1000 Wednesday as 63 more bodies have been recovered in Louisiana, authorities said in Baton Rouge.
Houston Mayor Bill White on Wednesday urged residents in low lying areas to leave Rita's striking range.
"Hurricane Rita on its present course poses a risk to Houston and the whole Houston region," White told a press conference in Texas.
"We are asking all residents in the Houston area and the greater Houston area that are in the storm surge area for a hurricane of this force and above to begin making their evacuation plans.
"We are calling for volunteer evacuations from several different areas.
First, those areas that are in the storm surge areas.
"Second, if you are in a 100 year flood plain, in an area that has experienced flooding in the past, those include many areas along some of the major bayou waterways.
We want you to voluntarily evacuate and make your plans for voluntary evacuations now and implement those plans."
He also urged those in mobile homes to evacuate.
Rita, packing winds of 215 kilometers (135 miles) per hour, was upgraded to a category four storm on the five level Saffir Simpson intensity scale as it bore down on Texas, where inhabitants of Galveston were ordered to flee the city.
Perry stressed "there's no need to panic.
We've been preparing for this type of event for a number of years.
We have run a great many training exercises for an event such as this.
"We reevaluated and we have improved our hurricane preparedness plans after Florida was hit four times in one year.
We are doing everything we can to prepare for this storm," the Texas governor said.
World oil prices made strong gains on Wednesday, as Hurricane Rita threatened fresh damage to energy facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, analysts said.
New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in November climbed 1.12 dollars to 67.32 dollars per barrel in electronic trading.
The October contract expired Tuesday at 66.23 dollars per barrel.
In London, the price of Brent North Sea crude for November delivery gained 94 cents to 65.14 dollars per barrel.
Concern over Rita had boosted oil prices by more than four dollars on Monday, before they slid a day later on profit taking.
Rita was tracking a path that could roughly follow that of recent Hurricane Katrina into the Gulf of Mexico where about one quarter of US oil operations are based.
Traders were meanwhile awaiting the latest weekly snapshot of US crude inventories, whose publication later Wednesday would show the extent to which stockpiles were recovering following the destruction to rigs and refineries caused by Katrina late last month.
"The market is now concerned that Hurricane Rita could extend the time that these facilities are offline for and even cause fresh damage," Sucden analyst Sam Tilley said.
"The market will also be watching the US crude inventory figures," he added.
Hurricane Rita gained strength on its way towards the US Gulf Coast and turned into a Category 5 storm Wednesday afternoon, forcing authorities to order the evacuation of more than 1.3 million residents in the region.
The hurricane, with winds up to 165 mph (264 kmp), was forecast to land somewhere along the Texas Gulf Coast between Galveston and Corpus Christi Saturday.
Texas Governor Rick Perry has urged residents along the state's entire coast to begin evacuating.
A similar evacuation order was issued in New Orleans of Louisiana, which was battered by Hurricane just three weeks ago leaving 799 people dead as of Wednesday.
The total number of death from Katrina along the Gulf Coast rose past 1000 to 1037. Category 5 is the highest on the five level hurricane intensity scale, and only three Category 5 hurricanes are known to have hit the US mainland.
To prepare for a potential catastrophe as that caused by Katrina, authorities have mobilized an estimated 319000 National Guard troops nationwide to respond to Rita if needed.
"We hope and pray that Hurricane Rita will not be a devastating storm, but we got to be ready for the worst," said US President George W. Bush on Wednesday, who has declared a state of emergency in Texas and Louisiana.
US President George W. Bush declared on Wednesday a state of emergency in Texas and Louisiana, at a time when both states were bracing for Hurricane Rita, the White House said.
Rita, which picked up strength and has turned into a Category 5 hurricane, could slam Texas by the weekend and bring floodwater to New Orleans, which was battered by Hurricane Katrina just over three weeks ago.
As many as 1 million people were ordered to evacuate along the Gulf Coast, and hospital and nursing home patients were evacuated Wednesday.
Meanwhile, the death toll from Katrina along the Gulf Coast rose over 1000 Wednesday to 1036.
The Louisiana state Health Department updated fatalities in the state to 799.
More than 7000 Hurricane Katrina survivors taking refuge in Texas shelters were being uprooted again Tuesday as Hurricane Rita threatened the state neighboring Louisiana, officials said.
About 4000 refugees from Louisiana housed in a shelter in Houston, Texas, are being moved to Arkansas, while 3000 more are moving from a San Antonio refuge to Tennessee, said David Passey, a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) spokesman.
Texas is also looking for states to house 360 refugees currently in Corpus Christi, Passey told reporters in Baton Rouge, in the state of Louisiana devastated by Katrina on August 29.
More than 13000 Katrina survivors are in Texas shelters, but authorities are only moving those located in vulnerable areas, he said.
"Texas right now bears the greatest threat from Hurricane Rita," Passey said.
"Today, the state of Texas is working with other states to evacuate the remaining Louisiana residents to other places."
He said he did not know how long the refugees would have to stay in the new shelters.
Authorities began relocating them by bus and plane Tuesday, Passey said.
Hundreds of thousands of people were forced from their homes by Katrina, which has left nearly 1000 people dead.
Nearly 97000 Katrina survivors are being housed in shelters across the United States, according to figures released Tuesday.
Hurricane Rita barreled near southern Florida islands and headed toward the Gulf of Mexico, threatening Texas and Louisiana with winds of 160 kilometers per hour (100 mph).
An evacuation order was issued Monday for Florida Keys as a tropical storm is moving quickly towards the southern US island chain.
The order will prompt the evacuation of some 40000 residents and tourists in the Atlantic archipelago near southeastern US mainland, US TV network CNN reported.
According to latest weather reports, Tropical Storm Rita is sustaining winds of 97 kph earlier Monday, and is likely to be upgraded to a level 1 hurricane by the time it passes the Florida Keys.
Earlier, Florida Governor Jeb Bush on Sunday declared a state of emergency for his state which includes the island chain of Florida Keys.
His order will give the state authority to oversee evacuations and activate the National Guard.
US National Hurricane Center Director Max Mayfield warned that people in some areas still recovering from Hurricane Katrina should be watching Rita.
"This is definitely becoming a concern for the northwestern Gulf of Mexico," he said, noting that Rita could pose a threat to Texas and Louisiana within days.
Rita is the 17th named storm of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, which started June 1 and will end Nov 30.
It is also the third tropical system to emerge from the Atlantic in two weeks.
Tropical Storm Phillippe was upgraded to a hurricane Sunday night, while Tropical Storm Ophelia was fading into the North Atlantic.
Hurricane Rita brushed past Key West on Tuesday and was forecast to strengthen into a major hurricane later in the week, prompting residents and rescuers to begin evacuating this feeble city, as well as parts of Louisiana and Texas.
From the tip of the Florida peninsula to Galveston, Texas, thousands left their homes or made plans to, including many who had already fled once, from Hurricane Katrina, and were living in shelters and temporary housing.
In Houston, officials began moving evacuees from New Orleans out of the Reliant Arena where they had found refuge and sending many of them on to Arkansas.
In Louisiana, Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco asked President Bush on Tuesday to declare a state of emergency for her battered state as it prepares for Hurricane Rita.
She requested $10 million in assistance.
Churning undiminished toward the warm and wide Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Rita could strengthen to Category 4 intensity as it approaches Texas later this week, said Colin McAdie, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
Hurricane Katrina was a Category 4 storm when it devastated parts of the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama on Aug 29.
McAdie said western Louisiana could also bear the brunt of the storm depending on changes in steering currents.
"It's better not to nail it down too precisely," he said.
"Over the next day or so we'll have a better idea."
The official death toll in Louisiana remained at 736.
In Mississippi, 219 people died from the storm.
In the city, mostly empty of residents but with its physical core still vulnerable, the possibility of heavy rain and a storm surge prompted officials to make emergency efforts to bolster its weakened levee system, station 500 buses on its outskirts to evacuate remaining residents and establish a military hospital at the convention center, which just weeks ago was the scene of violence and desperation for thousands of trapped evacuees from Hurricane Katrina.
The Texas coastal county of Galveston will order a mandatory evacuation on Wednesday in preparation for Hurricane Rita, the office of emergency management said Tuesday.
A county judge said he is planning on issuing a mandatory evacuation of nursing homes and assisted living facilities beginning at 6:00 am (9:00 GMT) Wednesday, with a mandatory evacuation of the general population beginning at 6:00 pm (2100 GMT) and continuing through Thursday afternoon.
Local schools have already closed and government offices will be closed Wednesday amid fears the hurricane could strike the region.
Hurricane Rita pounded the fragile Florida Keys islands Tuesday as it barreled toward the oil rich Gulf of Mexico.
Those wishing to enter the county to check on their boats or summer houses were warned to do so no later than noon on Wednesday as all traffic will be directed northbound after mandatory evacuation begins.
Shelters have been set up in three nearby towns and pets will be allowed in the shelters, officials said.
Many Louisiana residents were deterred from staying in a shelter during the deadly Hurricane Katrina because they did not want to abandon their pets.
Located just south of Houston, the county of Galveston is home to some 267000 people.
Emergency services began evacuating residents of hurricane ravaged New Orleans once again Tuesday due to the threat posed by Hurricane Rita, Mayor Ray Nagin said.
"We have had an influx of evacuees that have made their way to the convention center.
We've already evacuated two busloads of individuals," Nagin said as Rita barreled near southernmost Florida, heading west on a track that could take it close to the devastated Louisiana city.
Hurricane Rita strengthened to category two, packing winds of 160 kilometers per hour (100 mph) early Tuesday afternoon, the Miami based National Weather Center announced.
The storm headed from Atlantic waters off Cuba toward the Gulf of Mexico and was expected to pass about 65 kilometers (40 miles) off Key West, the southernmost city in a chain of islands linked to mainland Florida by a single bridge.
Forecasters warned that once it hits the warm Gulf of Mexico waters, Rita could gain further strength and reach category three on the five level Saffir Simpson hurricane intensity scale.
Hurricane Rita strengthened to category two, packing winds of 160 kilometers per hour (100 mph) early Tuesday afternoon, the Miami based National Weather Center announced.

Forecasters warned that once it hits the warm Gulf of Mexico waters, Rita could gain further strength and reach category three on the five level Saffir Simpson hurricane intensity scale.
Authorities warned people who had not evacuated Key West and the rest of the Florida Keys to remain indoors and hunker down until the storm has passed.
Forecasters said the Florida Keys could experience large and dangerous waves and storm surge of up to two meters (six feet.)
World oil prices fell further on Tuesday, despite a new hurricane powering towards oil facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, and as OPEC pledged to supply more crude from the start of October if required.
Hurricane Rita was upgraded from a tropical storm as it threatened the southeastern United States, forcing an alert in southern Florida and scuttling plans to repopulate New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina turned it into a ghost city three weeks earlier.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meanwhile, pledged to make an extra two million more barrels per day available to oil markets from October 1 if there were adequate demand, while holding its official production ceiling at 28 million barrels per day.
New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in October, which lapses later Tuesday, sank 1.09 dollars to 66.30 dollars per barrel during early trading.
In London, the price of Brent North Sea crude for November delivery lost 1.29 dollars to 64.32 dollars per barrel.
Crude futures extended earlier losses, made on profit taking, after surging more than four dollars on Monday as Rita looked set to reach hurricane strength over the oil rich Gulf Coast.
Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco declared a state of emergency in western Louisiana on Tuesday and urged people to evacuate as strengthening Hurricane Rita headed toward the Gulf of Mexico.
"I have put the state on alert.
We've declared another emergency for particularly at this moment for southwest Louisiana," Blanco said.
"We're urging people to evacuate," she told a press conference as Rita barreled near southernmost Florida, heading west on a track that could take it close to the devastated Louisiana city.
Iberia and American Airlines said Tuesday they were suspending flights between Madrid and Miami because of Hurricane Rita.
Both companies told AFP they were awaiting information from US authorities before deciding to restore the flights.
The Miami based National Weather Center said the hurricane strengthened Tuesday, packing winds of 160 kilometers per hour (100 mph).
Mickey Mouse, Sleeping Beauty's castle and the Lion King are all here at Disney's new theme park in Hong Kong, along with classic rides familiar to fans of other Disney theme parks Space Mountain, the Mad Hatter Tea Cups and Dumbo.
But in creating the Disney experience for a mostly Chinese audience, this thoroughly American and notoriously detail obsessed company has incorporated many elements of local culture.
Experts in the Chinese tradition of feng shui the belief that harmonious energy and good fortune can be achieved by the correct positioning of furniture and other objects were put on the payroll.
And while Coke and hamburgers can easily be found, guests can also dine on dim sum and sweet and sour pork.
Signage is in both Chinese and English.
On the advice of feng shui masters, the park faces the water with mountains in the back.
The feng shui experts even picked the opening date of the park Sept 12.
Park officials also tweaked the layout to conform with feng shui principles.
They recommended "no fire" zones in restaurant kitchens with an eye to keeping the five elements of metal, water, wood, fire and earth in balance and water fountains.
A giant fountain near the park entrance features Mickey Mouse surfing on a stream of water spouting from a whale.
Statues of Donald Duck and Minnie Mouse stand nearby.
Visitors can navigate the park with signs written in their native Chinese, but the rides also include bilingual explanations.
Inside the Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters ride, a talking animated Buzz Lightyear figure speaks in English while Chinese subtitles are flashed on a display board nearby.
Disney has delved deepest into local culture with the menu, which encompasses several Asian cuisines.
Apart from Chinese staples, there's also Kashmiri chicken curry and shrimp and vegetable tempura.
The Asian culinary delights are served in restaurants with decidedly un Chinese architecture, providing a sometimes bizarre East meets West contrast.
The Tahitian Terrace restaurant serves roasted duck and curry laksa noodle soup.
The Viennese influenced Market House Bakery in Main Street, U.S.A, uses European decor but juxtaposes Western pastries with Hong Kong style delicacies.
Chocolate croissants and cinnamon rolls are displayed alongside barbecued pork puffs, egg tarts and pineapple buns.
The rest of the park and even supporting infrastructure is vintage Disney.
Hong Kong's subway operator has launched a Mickey themed train carriage with windows and hanging straps shaped like the character's head to ferry visitors from a suburban rail line to the park and back.
Hong Kong Disneyland also includes a variety of Disney attractions found elsewhere.
In addition to Space Mountain, Mad Hatter Tea Cups, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, and Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters, there is a Jungle River Cruise and the "Festival of the Lion King" show, inspired by the animated movie.
Anchoring the park's skyline is a replica of the original Sleeping Beauty Castle from Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., the flagship park that opened 50 years ago.
And "The Golden Mickeys," a Broadway style show that until now has been seen only on Disney cruises, has come ashore with its debut in Hong Kong.
One standout in Hong Kong is Mickey's PhilharMagic in Fantasyland, a 3 D show with appearances from Mickey, Donald Duck, Ariel from "The Little Mermaid," Aladdin, Peter Pan, Tinker Bell and Simba.
With the help of 3 D glasses, the Disney characters appear as if they're right in front of the viewer.
When Donald Duck is splashed with water, the audience is likewise sprinkled.
The scent of cherries fills the theater when a dessert dish shows up on screen.
Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy certainly aren't alien to the children of Westernized Hong Kong, but the average person in mainland China, a major target market for Hong Kong Disneyland, is less Disney savvy.
So Disney has launched a massive marketing campaign.
It tapped clean cut Hong Kong pop star Jacky Cheung a singer and actor who is one of the biggest acts in the Chinese speaking world as park spokesman.
Since July 2004, Chan has hosted a TV program aired in both Hong Kong and China that shows classic Disney movies.
Disney has also introduced a fashion line at bargain clothing retailer Giordano, which has 1500 outlets in Asia, Australia and the Middle East, 644 of which are in mainland China.
The clothing features pictures of Disney characters ranging from Mickey to Nemo.
A heavy dosage of all things Disney aside, Hong Kong Disneyland offers a rare expanse of space and lush greenery in a densely populated territory better known for its towering skyscrapers than wildlife.
The park is a landscaping achievement, reproducing a slice of America with Asian accents.
The driveway leading to the park entrance is lined with tall palm trees, and Adventureland mixes palm trees with bamboo fences, torches, rock formations, straw thatched roofs and a fake jungle river in what resembles the set of the TV show "Survivor."
Long open air shelters that make up the bus depot are decorated by old style lamps and rotating fan blades hanging from the ceiling, creating the feel of a saloon in the old American West.
At 126 hectares (310 acres), Hong Kong Disneyland is the smallest Disney park in the world, but Disney says expansions are planned.
One addition already lined up is the Autopia car ride in Tomorrowland.
Pricing at the park is affordable by Hong Kong standards but on the higher end for visitors from China.
Even in the commercial hub of Shanghai, which enjoys a much higher standard of living than most Chinese cities, the minimum monthly wage is a paltry 690 Chinese yuan (US$85,euro70).
At the Emporium souvenir shop, a Mickey Mouse key chain costs 60 Hong Kong dollars (US$7.70,euro6.4), a standard Hong Kong Disneyland cap is priced HK$100 (US$13,euro11).
Admission is HK$350 (US$45,euro37) for the weekend and public holidays, HK$295 (US$38,euro31) on weekdays the cheapest among Disney's five parks around the world.
Children under 11 pay HK$250 (US$32,euro27) on weekends and HK$210 (US$27,euro22) during the week.
The park houses two hotels Victorian style Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel, with lots of towers and fussy architecture, and the sleek looking Disney's Hollywood Hotel.
These accommodations are steeply priced: Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel starts at HK$1600 (US$205,euro170) a night and Disney's Hollywood Hotel's cheapest room costs HK$1000 (US$128,euro106).
For budget travelers, staying in the city is recommended.
Hong Kong offers hotels in many different price ranges, and the park is only about a 20 plus minute subway train ride from downtown Hong Kong.
Hong Kong is banking on Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Buzz Lightyear to turn the city of skyscrapers and designer boutiques into one of the best places in Asia for a family holiday.
But critics say Hong Kong Disneyland, which opens Sept 12, won't be the magic kingdom its supporters say it will be.
They question whether the park is the best way to create jobs, and they're also doubtful that it will attract big spending tourists.
A fantasy land with a Sleeping Beauty Castle set against lush mountains on an outlying island, Hong Kong Disneyland predicts it will draw about 3.6 million tourists to Hong Kong within a year and up to 7.4 million annually after 15 years.
The park is expected to create 18400 jobs 5000 on site and the rest indirectly a number predicted to grow to 35800 over two decades, according to the park and its prime investor, the Hong Kong government.
Authorities have bold ambitions: They hope Mickey Mouse will bring in a total of 148 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$19 billion, euro15 billion) over 40 years and transform the center for shopping and gourmet food into a tourist destination for all ages.
These potential benefits came at a hefty price for the government, which has a 57 percent stake in the park.
Hong Kong taxpayers are shelling out HK$16.5 billion (US$2.1 billion, euro1.7 billion), including costs for reclaiming land and supporting infrastructure, and extending a HK$6.1 billion (US$782 million, euro631 million) loan.
Disney's tab comes in much smaller.
It's paying HK$2.45 billion (US$314 million, euro253 million) and HK$120 million (US$15.4 million, euro12.4 million) in rent per year.
But even Hong Kong's political opposition, frequently at odds with the government, thinks it's the right move.
Democratic Party lawmaker Sin Chung kai, the opposition's point man on the project, said the park will boost Hong Kong's economy.
"Looking at jobs creation ,tourism, we approved the project from this perspective," Sin said.
But critics say Hong Kong Disneyland is overrated.
Without the theme park, the territory's economy would still be able to generate just as many jobs and without the hefty investment from taxpayers, argues Credit Suisse First Boston economist Tao Dong.
"It has more news value than economic value," he said.
Tao questioned whether Hong Kong offered enough flights and hotel rooms to handle the expected influx of Disneyland visitors.
The Hong Kong Hotels Association has said the territory aims to add 14000 extra hotel rooms by the end of the year.
Disneyland officials have said they expect about 40 percent of the visitors will eventually come from mainland China, just a short ride away by bus or train.
China relaxed rules on travel to Hong Kong in 2003, allowing its citizens to go as individuals instead of part of a tour group.
Tony Latter, a senior research fellow at the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy, expressed worries that low spending tourists an apparent reference to visitors from China, where wages are low may create more problems than benefits.
"High spenders are fine.
But the low spenders probably incur more hidden costs in terms of inconvenience, and pressure on infrastructure, than they generate added value for the economy," Latter said in a recent op ed piece in the South China Morning Post.
Chinese traveling to Hong Kong on their own instead of with a tour group spent an average of HK$7429 (US$952, euro768) in 2005, down from HK$10440 in 2004, according to a study by Market Insights Group, which also found that more than 10 percent of the visitors in 2005 were just window shoppers.
They spent an average of about four days in the city in 2005, compared to about a week in 2004, the survey said.
The government should enrich the tourist experience beyond shopping by developing more tourist sites and activities unique to Hong Kong, not just Disneyland, Market Insights Group Director Roland Leung said.
"In terms of developing tourism facilities, we are focusing too much on one new site Disneyland," he said.
"We worry that even though people will spend an extra few hundred (Hong Kong) dollars (US$20 30) on tickets and some extra money on food, drinks and souvenirs because of Disneyland, overall it may not necessarily have a significant economic effect," he said.
The ticket sale of the Hong Kong Disneyland has been proceeding well, although there are still tickets left for all the days available for booking online, Hong Kong Disneyland Group Managing Director Don Robinson said Monday.
"We started ticket sales last week, they are very popular.
The opening day and the weekend is most popular."
Robinson said after a signing ceremony with Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited.
Although the tickets for all the days are not sold out, Robinson said he is satisfied with the sale so far.
He said the company is looking into other sale outlets.
The Disneyland and Standard Chartered have signed an agreement Monday for Standard Chartered to take a leading role in providing various banking services for Hong Kong Disneyland, including the exclusive provision of ATMs throughout the park.
All of the 16000 tickets for the opening day of Hong Kong Disneyland have been sold out and the park will open to the public from 1:00 p.m. (0300 GMT) on Sept 12, said Eva Cheng, Hong Kong commissioner for Tourism here Thursday.
Speaking at a press conference for arrangements of Hong Kong Disneyland's opening, she said the Transport Department, Immigration Department, Police and some other government departments have made full preparations for the smooth opening of Hong Kong Disneyland.
The opening of Hong Kong Disneyland is expected to turn on a new page of Hong Kong tourism, with focus on family tourists, she said.
Simon Peh, assistant director of Immigration Department, said as one thirds of the Hong Kong Disneyland visitors are expected to come from the Chinese mainland, the Immigration Department is ready to dispatch more staff members to various cross border check points during the opening day and other holidays.
He suggested Chinese mainland passengers arrive in Hong Kong via Lo Wu Check Point, Hong Kong's largest cross boundary check point with 233 clearance counters.
Apart from the six franchised bus routes that operate to and from Hong Kong Disneyland as of Aug 16, 60 additional quotas for cross boundary coach services to and from Hong Kong Disneyland via Lok Ma Chau Control Point will become operational from Sept 12.
In addition, the Kwoloon Canton Railway Corporation will also operate a "rail bus" service for mainland visitors to travel between the Lo Wu Check Point and Hong Kong Disneyland via Sheung Shui Station from Sept 12.
Cheng said, a sample survey made among 3000 Guangdong citizens in August showed that over half of the people, who are ready to visit Hong Kong in September and October, plan to visit Hong Kong Disneyland.
To receive more tourists, the total number of hotel rooms will be increased from 40000 at the end of last year to about 54000 at the end of 2006, she added.
Commissioner for Tourism Eva Cheng Wednesday said the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland will be divided into three phases from early August in order to ensure a smooth and well coordinated start.
"The idea of a phased opening is to give the theme park, public transport operators and relevant departments a familiarization period to adjust their operation and services," Cheng said.
From early August to mid August, the Disneyland Resort Line is scheduled to run between Sunny Bay and Disneyland Resort Stations.
A section of the Park Promenade linked to the line will be opened.
From August to Sept 11, all public facilities at Penny's Bay, including public roads, the Park Promenade, the Inspiration Lake Recreation Center, the Disneyland Resort Public Transport Interchange, the Disneyland car and coach parks and the Disneyland Resort Pier will begin operation.
Franchised buses and taxis will also start service.
From Sept 12, the theme park and hotels will be open to the public.
To ensure both the public and visitors are well informed of the operation sequence, communication channels have been set up by relevant departments and operators.
Visitors can obtain information for planning their trips by visiting a designated website, the Transport Department's website, and the Hong Kong Disneyland website.
Inquiry telephone lines will also be provided by the department and Hong Kong Disneyland.
Information booklets, TV and radio commercials will be launched in August.
Cheng said the familiarization period will last for more than one month.
She urged people to plan their visit, and make good use of communication channels to gather important information, such as the new transport services and opening hours.
Many in Hong Kong are ready to give Mickey Mouse a big hug for bringing Disneyland to them.
But not dog lovers, shark defenders and fireworks foes.
The opposition may seem odd, in a Chinese city where fireworks are a fixture, shark fin soup is hugely popular, and stray dogs are summarily dealt with as health hazards.
But eight years after the British colony was returned to China, the capitalist city is much freer than the Communist mainland, and advocacy groups are vocal.
To start with the sharks: Disneyland said it was merely trying to honor local custom by selling shark fin soup at weddings in the park that opens Monday.
But environmentalists protested that shark populations are being depleted by the fishing industry, which usually hacks off the fins before tossing the fish back into the sea to die.
A top level decision was made to take the soup off the menu, said Robert Iger, president of the Walt Disney Co. Disney made more headlines when it asked dog catchers to round up dozens of stray mutts near the park, sending many of them to a certain death.
And then there were the plans for nightly fireworks displays at the park on Lantau, Hong Kong's largest island.
Neighbors said they were worried about the noise and smoke, but the park stuck with its original plans.
In the months before the park's opening, the media sometimes sounded as though Disney were building a shoddy nuclear plant, rather than a cheerful amusement park with cuddly cartoon characters and a pink Sleeping Beauty Castle with a mountain backdrop.
Hong Kong Disneyland became a target because it involved high profile marriage of big business and Hong Kong's government, the biggest investor in the US$3 billion park, said David Ketchum, a public relations expert.
"As the Australians say, 'The tall poppy gets the chop,' and Disney's high profile worldwide and the lead up to the opening has meant that many are looking for ways the venture will fail," Ketchum said.
Michael DeGolyer, professor of government and international studies at Hong Kong Baptist University, said Disneyland apparently underestimated environmental cares in the crowded territory of about 7 million people.
"If they thought that a huge commitment of government money would cushion them from public criticism, I think they will, and seem already, to be discovering that is not, definitely not, the case," DeGolyer said.
But Disneyland's Iger said construction went smoothly with no major harm to the environment or public.
"None of the issues really rose to the level of what I call a major concern in our minds, because they were either exaggerated and I won't be specific or they were fixable," Iger told The Associated Press.
Hong Kong's leader, Donald Tsang, dismissed the complaints about the fireworks, saying Disneyland is complying with regulations.
"They have passed the test and I am satisfied with those tests," the chief executive told reporters.
Tsang's administration says the park will create thousands of new jobs and help turn Hong Kong into a regional tourist destination for families.
Christine Loh, a former lawmaker who runs her own think tank, Civic Exchange, said, "Hong Kong people as a whole don't hate Disney.
They don't think it's the most awful thing to have a Disney theme park in Hong Kong unlike other parts of the world where citizens got together and said they don't want this kind of trash."
But Loh said there's unease and suspicion over the government being the park's prime investor as well as its regulator, and over the size of its stake.
"The initial reaction was quite positive," she said.
"But as it rolled out, Hong Kong people felt, is this a reasonable deal for us, or are we giving away pretty much everything to have them?"
Hong Kong Disneyland started its on line tickets selling Friday and its spokesperson said the process had been smooth so far.
Hong Kong Disneyland announced its on line ticketing plan on June 22.
People who want to visit the theme park need to use their credit card to book tickets through the website of Hong Kong Disneyland.
Each credit card can buy at most 10 tickets.
The theme park said that starting from Friday, guests can buy tickets for its grand opening day on Sept 12 and the first 90 days after its opening.
Hong Kong Disneyland will begin its rehearsal on Aug 16 and it will last for approximately four weeks.
Rehearsal days have been a long standing tradition at Disney theme parks and present an opportunity for cast members Disneyland's term for employees to practice and adjust their performance.
Specially invited guests include business affiliates, travel trade associates, contractors, consultants, alliance partners, government officers who have been involved in the disneyland project, and certain charitable organizations.
Among the first guests to be received during the rehearsal days will be Hong Kong Disneyland cast members and their families.
Invitations to guests will range from several thousand to 30, 000 on a daily basis.
Hong Kong Disneyland said Thursday it won't cut its daily maximum capacity of 30000 people despite complaints of large crowds and long queues from visitors during rehearsal days.
Many of the 29000 visitors who visited Hong Kong Disneyland for a charity day last weekend complained of excessively long queues to enter the park as well as to get on rides, and critics have urged Disney to reduce its maximum daily capacity, local newspapers reported.
But a Disney spokeswoman, Esther Wong, said the company is "confident we can manage peak day attendance in the future and have designed our marketing and sales plan to manage attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland throughout the year."
Earlier, Disney said it was considering extending opening hours and adding more shows at the park due to open Monday as Hong Kong's financial chief expressed concern about the large crowds when the park is operating at its capacity.
The park, a joint venture between the Hong Kong government and The Walt Disney Co., is expected to draw 5.6 million people in its first year of operation, with mainland Chinese tourists accounting for about a third of that number.
But mainland travel agents said ticket sales for Hong Kong Disneyland are poor as the long queues and expensive hotel rates are driving mainland tourists away, the South China Morning Post reported Thursday.
"We only managed to sell roughly 300 tickets during the first week after the park opens," Huang Feiyueh, executive director of Amsito Travel Service, was quoted as saying.
A survey released Wednesday by Hong Kong's top pro China political party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, also showed that about three out of 10 people who had visited Hong Kong Disneyland said they won't go back.
Wong, however, disputed the criticisms and said "we are confident that our park will be very popular."
Disney officials consulted Chinese feng shui experts before building Hong Kong Disneyland, making changes such as tilting the site of the park several degrees and setting up "no fire zones" in kitchens, a company spokeswoman said Sunday.
Feng shui is the Chinese belief that harmonious energy and therefore better fortune can be achieved by the correct positioning of furniture and other objects.
Other feng shui influences include the park's orientation to face water with mountains behind, Hong Kong Disneyland spokeswoman Esther Wong said.
The park's groundbreaking date and opening date of Sept 12 were picked after conferring with feng shui specialists, she said.
Feng shui experts also designated "no fire zones" in the kitchens, to try to keep the five elements of metal, water, wood, fire and earth in balance.
Wong said U.S. based Walt Disney Co. decided to observe feng shui because it wanted to defer to local custom.
"It's cultural considerations," Wong said, noting, "all the food and language in the park must follow the habits and tastes of our consumers and future guests."
Hong Kongers tend to be Westernized, but Hong Kong Disneyland is expected to draw droves of guests from neighboring mainland China.
However, Disney's cultural sensitivity drew a backlash recently.
The park had planned to serve shark's fin soup, a Chinese delicacy, but dropped the dish after protests from environmentalists who expressed fears about the extinction of sharks.
Hong Kong Disneyland built on reclaimed land in the outlying Lantau island is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and the Hong Kong government, but local taxpayers are footing most of the construction bill.
Critics have questioned whether the government got a good deal.
Officials have said the park will boost employment and tourism.
Hong Kong Disneyland will stage its rehearsal from Aug 16 to the theme park's opening on Sept 12, the park said in a press release on Friday.
Rehearsal days have been a long standing tradition at Disney theme parks and resorts around the world and present an opportunity for cast members, Disney's term for employees, to practice and adjust their performance.
The rehearsal period at HK Disneyland will last for approximately four weeks prior to the grand opening.
Specially invited guests including business affiliates, travel trade associates, contractors, consultants, alliance partners, government officers who have been involved in the Hong Kong Disneyland project, and certain charitable organizations can enjoy a full day of Disney magic.
Among the first guests to be received during rehearsal days will be Hong Kong Disneyland cast members and their families on August 16.
Invitations to guests to experience the park will range from thousands to 30000 on a daily basis.
Meanwhile, tickets for Hong Kong Disneyland's grand opening day and the first 90 days after its opening went on sale Friday.
Hong Kong Disneyland said Tuesday it will offer ticket discounts for one month to local residents to thank them for their support, but denied the move was prompted by low attendance at the park, which opened two months ago.
"The discount has absolutely no relation to attendance numbers," park spokeswoman Esther Wong said.
"We are thanking locals for giving us good support since we opened."
Starting Tuesday, prices for Hong Kong residents will be slashed by HK$50 (US$6.40, euro5.5) per ticket a reduction of about 20 percent.
A peak time ticket for an adult will cost HK$300 (US$38.60, euro33), instead of HK$350 (US$45, euro38.50).
The discount, given to those with a Hong Kong ID card, will last until Dec 8.
Although Hong Kong Disneyland said the discount was unrelated to attendance, the park has repeatedly refused to disclose how many people have been visiting.
Many local media reports have said that attendance has been disappointing.
On Tuesday, Wong said the park has no plans to disclose attendance numbers because they are confidential commercial information.
This has angered some lawmakers who argue that the public should be privy to the information since the Hong Kong government is the biggest investor in the park.
The government paid US$2.4 billion for the park's construction, while Disney paid over US$314 million, according to official figures.
Attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland is running below government forecasts two months after the park opened, the South China Morning Post reported Monday.
Disneyland officials have refused to say how many people have visited the park.
This has angered lawmakers, who say the public has the right to know since the government owns 57 percent of the attraction.
The Post reported that it sent four reporters to Disneyland on Nov 13 and 16 to count visitors with handheld tally counters.
The reporters counted 12972 visitors passing through the turnstiles on Nov 13 and 11399 on Nov 16, the paper said.
The government has said it expected 5.6 million visitors an average of 15342 per day to the park in its first year of operation, the paper said.
The MTR Corp., which operates a special subway line to the park, said it usually carries 10000 riders a day on weekdays and 20000 on Sundays, the paper said.
However, some of the riders only visit the promenade outside Disneyland and don't go into the park, the paper said.
A Disney spokeswoman said the newspaper's count was flawed but declined to give the company's own figures, the report said.
A Tourism Commission spokeswoman said the Hong Kong government, which is the majority owner of the park, won't disclose attendance figures for commercial reasons, the paper said.
The government paid US$2.4 billion for the park's construction, while Walt Disney Co. paid over US$314 million, according to official figures.
Hong Kong Disneyland threw open its gates to the public on Monday, marking Mickey Mouse's biggest push into China a market the U.S. company hopes will flood the theme park with splurging tourists from the world's most populous nation.
With the pink Snow White Castle behind them, Disney executives and a senior Chinese leader celebrated the opening with musicians clanging cymbals, Chinese lion dancers prancing precariously on tall poles and fireworks bursting in the sky.
The ceremony ended with a parade of skipping Disney characters old and new: Mickey, Donald Duck, Mushu the dragon, Lilo and Winnie the Pooh.
Robert Iger, president of the Walt Disney Co., said it was exciting being part of China's future.
"As millions discover the wonders of Hong Kong and China one of the most rapidly growing travel destinations in the world the future is indeed bright," he said.
Chinese Vice President Zeng Qinghong called the park "Hong Kongers' eternal carnival."
Hundreds of visitors lined up outside the park's gate, waiting to get in despite muggy, sweltering heat.
Michael Kuzma, of Celebration, Florida, began queuing up a day early and was first in line.
"For over 50 years, the American people have experienced the happiness of Disney theme parks.
I hope the people of China can enjoy the happiness," the 36 year old consultant said.
The attraction and its two resort hotels are surrounded by mountains on lush Lantau Island, just 30 minutes away by subway from bustling central Hong Kong.
It looks much like the first Disneyland in California, with a Space Mountain thrill ride, a classic Cinderella Carousel and Sleeping Beauty Castle which Disney predicts will be one of the most photographed buildings in Asia.
Hong Kong's government the biggest investor in the US$3.5 billion park says the attraction will help turn this global financial capital into Asia's best family holiday spot.
Disney hopes the park the 11th in its global empire will be a magnet for increasingly wealthy Chinese tourists, who have a reputation for being big spenders.
Iger, president of Walt Disney Co., has said the Hong Kong park is a "first big step" in expanding the company's reach into China, where generations have grown up with little or no familiarity with Mickey Mouse.
Iger said the park would create a media buzz and word of mouth excitement that would ignite interest in Disney films, TV shows and other products.
Hong Kong based Phoenix Television broadcast the Disneyland opening live to viewers across China.
Michael Eisner, Disney's chief executive officer, said China and Disneyland will be a perfect match because they both value families.
"You go to the park and you see mothers, daughters and kids and grandparents.
The family unit in China is unbelievably strong.
It's not just Hong Kong, it's mainland China," Eisner said.
An hour before Monday's opening ceremony, a small crowd of labor, human rights and anti Disney activists gathered outside the park's front gate, chanting "No Conscience" and "Evil Mickey."
They were protesting alleged labor abuses at factories making Disney products in China.
Disney has said it's investigating the claims.
Hong Kong and Disney struck a deal to build the park in 1999 just two years after the former British colony returned to Chinese rule.
The city had been battered by the Asian financial crisis, and desperately needed a new project to boost its spirits and troubled economy.
Disneyland says it employs 5000 people and will draw 5.6 million visitors in its first year.
So far, the biggest complaint among some of the thousands who got a sneak peak at the park during a soft opening period has been that Hong Kong Disneyland is too small.
It's Disney's smallest park at 40 hectares (about 100 acres).
The entire attraction including the two hotels is 121 hectares (298 acres) and there's room to expand to 200 hectares (494 acres).
Chinese tourist Zhang Wei predicted the park would be a big hit with the mainland Chinese.
"Disney has a big name and it will definitely attract people and be a success," said the 38 year old businessman from Beijing as he finished watching the daily parade of floats carrying a waving Little Mermaid, Alice in Wonderland and Buzz Lightyear.
Hong Kongers have a reputation for being brusque and unsmiling, but the Disneyland staff including cleaners and guards have been trying to master the Disney tradition of giving guests a warm smile and hello.
The greetings were Hong Kong visitor Evie Chan's favorite thing about the park.
"The staff here is very friendly," said Chan, an employee of a marketing firm in her late 20s.
"It's like we've known each other for a long time."
Hong Kong leader Donald Tsang Saturday defended the newly opened Disneyland against complaints of harsh labor conditions, saying Disney needs time to learn the local culture.
Hong Kong Disneyland employees have complained of long hours, quick turnarounds and a lack of breaks.
"We have to remember that Disneyland is a new organization (in Hong Kong).
It may need time to understand the situation of Hong Kong and especially the culture of Hong Kongers and figure out how to make all its employees happy," Tsang said at a question and answer session with local students.
Tsang expressed surprise that an experienced company like Disney would run into problems in Hong Kong.
But he said Disneyland, in which the Hong Kong government has a 57 percent stake, has gotten off to a "very successful start."
The park has not announced attendance figures.
Hong Kong Disneyland is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and the local government, but Hong Kong taxpayers shouldered most of the construction cost.
Critics have accused the government of bending over backward to accommodate Disney.
Hong Kong Disneyland, the 11th theme park of Walt Disney Co., officially opened here on Monday morning.
Chinese Vice President Zeng Qinghong, Donald Tsang Yam kuen, chief executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( HKSAR), and Tung Chee hwa, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee attended the opening.
The Hong Kong Disneyland project, worth 3.5 billion US dollars, was jointly funded by Walt Disney Co. and the HKSAR government.
Some 16000 people attended the opening, and analysts predict the park will attract 5.6 million visitors in the opening year.
Hong Kong's Disney theme park has drawn much lower than expected visitors in the two months since opening, a press report said Monday.
A headcount of visitors to the park carried out by four reporters of the South China Morning Post showed that 12972 people visited on Sunday November 13, and 11399 entered on Wednesday November 16.
The government, which owns a 57 percent stake in the three billion US dollar resort, said it expected 5.6 million visitors in its first year of operation, equivalent to an average daily attendance of 15342.
The park failed to attract the crowds despite introducing a discounted price for Hong Kong residents from November 8 to December 8, the report said.
Disney and the government have so far refused to reveal the park's daily attendance figures.
Rail operator MTR Corp has said the Disneyland Resort line carries 10000 people on weekdays and 20000 on Sundays.
A Disneyland spokeswoman dismissed the headcount, saying: "Any attempt to count our attendance is flawed" while a Tourism Commission spokeswoman declined to reveal the figures for commercial reasons.
Hong Kong Disneyland Tuesday dismissed a report that the two month old theme park is suffering from poor attendence and has failed to attract the number of visitors expected by the local government.
"We are actually very happy with the attendence over the last couple of weeks so we are not at all concerned," said Roy Tan Hardy, vice president of marketing and sales for Hong Kong Disneyland.
He declined to reveal the actual attendence figures.
"We can tell you it's been very very strong ,we are very happy with the way things are going," he told local radio.
The South China Morning Post reported Monday that the theme park has drawn fewer than expected visitors since its opening on September 12 and a week after it introduced a discounted price for local residents.
A headcount of visitors to the park carried out by four reporters showed that 12972 people visited on Sunday November 13 and 11399 on Wednesday November 16.
The government, which owns a 57 percent stake in the three billion US dollar resort, has said it expected 5.6 million visitors in its first year of operation, equivalent to an average daily attendance of 15342.
The government also refused to reveal the park's daily attendance figures although rail operator MTR Corp has said the Disneyland Resort line carries 10000 people on weekdays and 20000 on Sundays.
The newly opened Hong Kong Disneyland said Friday it prefers that its 5000 workers not unionize as activists described tough work conditions at the park such as long hours, harsh turnarounds and lack of breaks.
Disneyland, which opened two weeks ago, said in a statement it respects the right of workers to seek union representation, but that it thinks it's more effective for labor and management to "work and communicate directly with each other."
The statement came as activists detailed strenuous work conditions at the park and an organizer said it's exploring the option of setting up a union with park workers.
Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions Organizing Secretary Elaine Hui said the park was unresponsive to workers and that they need the leverage of a union to protect themselves.
"In the long run, if they want to discuss their treatment with the company, they need to rely on the power of a union to get the right to dialogue under equal circumstances," she said, noting Disneylands in the U.S. and France have unions.
However, Hui said a stumbling block to unionizing is concern that the park may retaliate against workers who join the union.
As the union dilemma is debated, activists said Disneyland workers complain they work up to 13 hours a day and must make quick turnarounds, with some leaving work late in the evening and due back early in the morning the next day.
The long hours are aggravated by the long travel time to and from the park, which is located on Hong Kong's outlying Lantau island, the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions and Disney Hunter, a Disneyland watchdog group, said in a statement issued Thursday.
The activists urged Disneyland, which opened Sept 12, to arrange bus services for workers covering more areas.
They also said the workers' 45 minute lunch break should be lengthened to an hour and that 15 minute breaks every four hours aren't enforced because of staff shortages.
"Disney's goal is to pursue dreams and bring happiness to the masses, but its labor policy is entirely opposite to such a goal, disappointing its eager workers and the masses," the activists said in their statement.
Hong Kong Disneyland spokeswoman Esther Wong said Friday the park won't comment on the allegations in detail, but that some of them are inaccurate.
Wong said labor management relations are good and that staff retention has been strong.
But she said the park will listen to worker feedback.
"Our cast members are a very important component," she said, using Disney's terminology for its workers.
Disney says "well over" 1 million people have visited Hong Kong Disneyland, finally relenting in releasing visitor figures amid speculation of disappointing attendance and criticism that the park mostly owned by the local government wasn't transparent enough.
"Hong Kong Disneyland has welcomed and entertained well over 1 million guests," Walt Disney Parks and Resorts said in a statement issued late Wednesday.
The statement came after park officials repeatedly refused to disclose visitor numbers because of their sensitive nature and media reports that attendance at the park has been lackluster.
The South China Morning Post reported Monday that its reporters counted several thousand fewer park guests than the projected first year daily average of 15342 on two days in November.
In Wednesday's statement, Disney Parks and Resorts Chairman Jay Rasulo said such calculations are "meaningless" because they don't factor in seasonality.
"The bottom line is this: Attendance is ramping up well, which continues to give us confidence that we are on track to achieve our long term attendance goals," Rasulo said.
Disneyland's silence until now has frustrated critics who say the park must be held accountable to the public because of the level of government investment.
The government paid US$2.4 billion (euro2.03 billion) for the park's construction, while Disney paid over US$314 million (euro 266 million), according to official figures.
Disney also said mainland China, expected to be a major source of tourists for the park, accounted for over a quarter, or 26 percent of guests.
Foreigners contributed 25 percent, and locals had a 49 percent share.
Hong Kong Disneyland said on Wednesday that over 80 percent of its guests have rated the overall experience at Hong Kong Disneyland as very good or excellent.
Don Robinson, group managing director of Hong Kong Disneyland, said in a press release that it has achieved similar ratings for park cleanness, cast friendliness and entertainment.
It said similarly ,over 80 percent of the guests of its two hotels have rated a positive satisfaction and more than half said they intend to make a return visit.
However, it still declined to reveal the detailed number of guests it has received in the past month.
Robinson said, over the past month, Hong Kong Disneyland received thousands of guests including the first marriage proposal on grand opening day and several large family reunions destination that unites people and crates a lifetime of happy memories.
He said, based on guest feedback over the past month, Hong Kong Disneyland has fine tuned the park's operations to ensure the most magical experience possible for al guests.
According to HK Disneyland, guests are choosing to purchase park tickets both on line and the Hong Kong Disneyland Ticket Express Station at Hong Kong Station.
The project of Hong Kong Disneyland was announced in 1999 and the construction began in 2003.
It formally opened on Sept 12.
The sun began poking through the clouds as California emergency crews shifted into cleanup mode after a six day drenching that killed at least nine people, destroyed dozens of houses and flooded roads and airports.
The Transportation Department hurried Wednesday to clear at least 20 major roads closed by mudslides and flooding, and in Malibu, crews prepared to destroy a boulder the size of a house that dangled precariously above the Pacific Coast Highway, held back by only a retaining wall.
Crews also worked to fill thousands of potholes some the size of cars.
Engineers fanned out across Los Angeles to assess whether houses on slipping soil were still habitable.
More than 100 homes were temporarily uninhabitable or safe only for limited entry.
Los Angeles city fire spokesman Brian Humphrey said some ambulance crews had been diverted to work as reconnaissance teams to spot signs of flooding and mudslides.
Firefighters, meanwhile, were working 24 hour shifts with little time to eat or even use the restroom.
On Monday, the heaviest day of rain, the department received nearly 2000 calls twice the normal amount, Humphrey said.
Rain fell early in the day Wednesday across part of Southern California but was expected to taper off as the storm's center headed east along the California Mexico border.
The storms began last Thursday, bringing 9.14 inches (23.22 centimeters) by Wednesday morning to a city where the average for an entire year is about 15 inches (38.1 centimeters).
Damage in Los Angeles County alone since Jan 1 was estimated at $52.5 million (euro39.76 million), including up to $10 million (euro7.57 million) in damage caused by the latest storm.
In Ventura County, the small Santa Paula airport remained closed after more than 155 feet (46.5 meters) of runway crumbled into the rushing Santa Clara River.
Mudslides forced Amtrak to suspend train service between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara through at least Thursday.
Among those killed were a man who was driving when a eucalyptus tree fell on his pickup truck in San Diego County and a 16 year old girl who was doing homework in an apartment bedroom when boulders hit her home near Irvine.
Rainfall since July 1, when California begins its yearly rainfall measurements, now totals 34.36 inches (87.27 centimeters) more than Seattle or Portland and the most in Los Angeles since 1889 90.
The record for a single year 38.18 inches (96.98 centimeters) was set in 1883 84.
South of the border in Tijuana, Mexico, authorities reported at least seven homes had collapsed in landslides and more than 150 people were evacuated.
Associated Press Writer Ryan Pearson contributed to this report.
It's looking like a crazy year for weather, and January isn't over yet.
Already we've seen record rains in California, floods in the Midwest and snow in south Texas.
Has Mother Nature gone bonkers?
Maybe just a little.
The weather definitely has been wild lately: Seventeen inches of rain fell on Los Angeles in 15 days from Dec 27 to Jan 10.
That's two inches more than the city averages for an entire year.
The heavy rains softened the ground and caused mudslides that killed people and destroyed homes.
Can you imagine if all that rain had been snow?
Folks in the Sierra Nevada mountains can.
The same storms that produced so much rain in the valleys of Southern California dumped 19 feet of snow in the mountains to the north.
That's 228 inches!
Brownsville, Texas, recorded 1.5 inches of snow on Christmas Day.
It was the first measurable snow there since 1895, and might have been the town's first ever White Christmas.
Snow is so rare there that a Brownsville snowball sold for $92 on eBay.
More than nine inches of precipitation has fallen in Indianapolis since the beginning of the year.
Normally, the Indiana city would have less than two inches by this time in January.
Large amounts of rain and snow have caused rivers all over the Midwest to spill over their banks and flood homes.
Temperatures have been wacky, too.
Last week the mercury dropped to 54 degrees below zero in Minnesota.
The state record is 60 below.
Here in Washington we were having a mild, snowless winter the high temperature reached 64 degrees or higher five times in the first half of January.
Now, it's freezing outside and we've had snow three times in one week.
So, what's going on?
Is it global warming?
Is El Nino to blame?
While scientists believe that global warming the slow increase in Earth's overall temperature could result in more extreme weather, there's no way to be sure it has anything to do with what has happened in the last several weeks.
Crazy weather is often blamed on El Nino, the warming of waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean that affects weather patterns all over the world.
But the current El Nino is pretty weak and probably isn't responsible for the wicked weather we've seen this year.
Instead, forecasters have traced some of the unusual activity, especially the storms out West, to another phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean.
This one is called the Madden Julian Oscillation, or MJO.
Discovered by scientists Roland Madden and Paul Julian, the MJO causes an increase in tropical rainfall and thunderstorms, which in turn affects weather in the United States and around the globe.
It's also important to remember that the weather is rarely "normal" anyway.
Temperatures and precipitation tend to go through cycles.
Just as sports teams have winning and losing streaks, the weather has warm and cool streaks, and wet and dry streaks.
That's part of what makes our planet so exciting.
You never know exactly how long a cold spell or heat wave will last, or how much rain or snow is on the way.
Makes you wonder what kind of wild weather tomorrow will bring.
Multi million dollar homes collapsed and mudslides trapped residents in their homes on Monday as a heavy rains that have claimed three lives pelted Los Angeles for the fifth straight day.
Scores of people were evacuated from their homes as severe flooding overtook suburbs of the second largest US city, including the chic district of Bel Air where three luxury homes slid down a hillside.
The swimming pool of one of the homes dramatically gave way, live on local television, and tumbled down a slope after their residents were evacuated.
As hailstones hit central Los Angeles, parts of nearby cities of Hunting Beach, Long Beach and Glendale were turned into lakes, leaving homes drenched and caked in layers of mud as a monster storm system hammered usually parched southern California, wreaking havoc across the region.
Three deaths have been blamed on the storms that have dumped but more than 19.5 centimeters (6.5 inches) on downtown Los Angeles between Thursday night and Monday morning.
A 16 year old girl died late Sunday when a boulder toppled down a hillside and crashed her family's apartment in the remote Silverado Canyon area of the city.
In addition, a city public works employee also died Sunday when he fell into a nine meter (30 foot ) deep sinkhole that developed earlier in a road in the when in the area of Sun Valley.
And on Monday, a 63 year old man died when he was buried in about 1.2 meters (four feet) of mud that slid into his home in the Woodland Hills area of the Los Angeles, said Melissa Kelley of the Los Angeles Fire Department.
Firefighters used heat sensing equipment to find the body, she said.
A woman sleeping in another room was uninjured.
In an area known as Hacienda Heights, a mudslide trapped at least three people in an apartment block that was inundated by 10 feet of mud.
One woman escaped on her own, but firefighters had to pull two others from the mess.
Residents of a mobile home park in the area of Newhall were awash after a creek overflowed drenching their trailers and belongings.
Some 94 centimeters (31.36 inches) of rain have fallen this winter, making it the wettest to hit Los Angeles in 22 years and the fifth wettest since the 1883 1884 season, when 38.18 inches fell, meteorologists said.
A record shattering storm slammed Southern California for a sixth straight day Tuesday, triggering mudslides and tornadoes and forcing more road closures, but forecasters predicted it would wane Wednesday before a new storm moves in Sunday night.
Officials put the statewide death toll from the current storms at nine, while damage mounted into the tens of millions of dollars.
Six deaths were reported in Southern California, three in Northern California.
Still, there was hope for a reprieve today from what already has become the fourth wettest year on record.
"It is still spawning some showers and some thunderstorms, but it's not going to be continuous rain for everyone, everywhere," said Jayme Laber, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.
"You might even see some blue skies."
Sagging, sodden hillsides collapsed throughout the city Tuesday, sending homes skidding down slopes and causing a swimming pool to slide into a neighboring home in Bel Air.
Tuesday's damage toll added to the death and devastation seen earlier in the storm.
Two men died in the San Fernando Valley, including Rory Shaw, 47, a Los Angeles civil engineer who died after being swept into sinkhole in Sun Valley, and Robert Wickham, 61, who died when a mudslide ripped into the bedroom of his home in Woodland Hills.
Other Southern California deaths include 16 year old Caitlin Oto, who was killed in the rural Silverado Canyon area east of Irvine when large boulders crashed into a wall as she did her homework, and three others who died in traffic crashes in San Bernardino and San Diego counties.
The storm has brought more than 9 inches of rain to Hansen Dam and Chatsworth Reservoir, exceeding the normal rainfall for an entire season.
More than 8 inches of rain has fallen in Van Nuys and downtown Los Angeles since Thursday.
Between 16 inches and 21 inches of rain has fallen in the local foothills and mountains.
In Ventura County, the flood swollen Santa Clara River devoured part of the runway at Santa Paula Airport, adding to an estimated $5 million in damage suffered in the January storms.
"It ate away a good portion of our airport," said Pat Quinn, the airport's emergency director.
"We've lost about 200 feet of runway so far, and it's not the end of the runway, it's in the middle.
We're in big trouble here."
Roads throughout Los Angeles and Ventura counties remained closed by mudslides Tuesday, and train service between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, suspended by a mudslide in Moorpark, will not resume until at least Thursday, Amtrak officials said.
Storms have caused $52.5 million in damage to Los Angeles County roads and facilities since the beginning of the year, said Donald Wolf, interim director of the Public Works Department.
The county has spent $9 million on repairs, including $500000 since the weekend, Wolf said.
The storm has also stretched emergency workers nearly to the limit.
"We've rescued a number of people from their cars because of flooding, we've dealt with trees down, we've dealt with high tension lines down, we've had to shut down gas lines, pretty much everything you can imagine," said Jim Wells, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department.
City inspectors have condemned 23 homes because of storm damage, and 69 others have been yellow tagged, meaning they can be occupied only during daytime hours, said Linda Aparicio, a spokeswoman for the city's Public Works Department.
Residents will have only the barest reprieve before a new storm system rolls into the region this weekend, Laber said.
Another storm is expected next week.
More than 33 inches of rain has fallen in downtown Los Angeles since July 1, the fourth wettest winter on record and just over 5 inches shy of the record set in the winter of 1883 84.
"We're closing in on some all time rainfall totals here," Laber said.
"And we still have March."
Mayor James Hahn called on the state on Tuesday to extend the state of emergency to help clean up.
"A lot of people are going to be shocked to find out their insurance doesn't cover this damage," Hahn said.
"That's why it's important for us to extend the emergency period to make funds available."
Hahn sent a letter to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to make the declaration, which is the first step in getting federal aid to the area.
Hahn estimated the city has suffered an additional $10 million in damage from the past week of storms.
Earlier storm damage was estimated at some $80 million.
Hahn toured several areas of the city hardest hit by the storms and noted it caused so much damage to some areas that homeowners might not be able to rebuild.
The yawning sinkhole on Tujunga Avenue in Sun Valley that began as a pothole grew to a 150 foot diameter, 30 foot deep crater Tuesday, and it was unclear when city officials would be able to begin repairs.
City Public Works spokeswoman Cora Jackson Fossett said crews can't fully investigate the site until rains subside.
But Councilman Tony Cardenas, whose district includes the site, said theories point to a cracked underground pipe that initially caused the earth to give way.
The problem intensified, he said, as soil flowed underground to a former gravel pit next door.
"Eventually the material started escaping into there," Cardenas said.
"That's why the hole is growing so large."
Without a storm water collection system in that area, water continued to pummel the area instead of getting diverted, he said.

Southern California's six day siege of torrential rains finally came to an end Wednesday, leaving scores of roads blocked by mudslides and washouts, dozens of homes uninhabitable and a massive cleanup job that could last for weeks.
Traffic on more than 100 roads in Los Angeles County was blocked or interrupted by the storms, and public works officials said highway damage was so widespread that some roads might not reopen until summer or even fall.
The Los Angeles City Council transferred $500000 from its reserve fund to provide loans and grants for residents displaced by damage, or the threat of it, to their homes.
Parting showers raised the rainfall total for the season in downtown Los Angeles to 33.87 inches Wednesday, making it the third wettest season on record and the rainiest in 115 years.
Typically, almost 5 inches of rain falls on the city between now and June 30, when the season ends.
That means there's a better than even chance that by the time this season is over, it will be the wettest ever, surpassing the record of 38.18 inches in 1883 84.
Just three years ago, the 2001 02 season was the driest ever, with only 4.42 inches.
Despite at least five storm related deaths and damage that could top $100 million, the rain did some good, too.
Southern California's storage reservoirs and underground aquifers are once again full, meaning there will be less reliance on water from distant sources such as the Colorado Basin, which is still in the throes of a long term drought.
Dry weather is expected for the remainder of this week, but the National Weather Service said there's a chance of light rain Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
The county and city departments of public works and the California Department of Transportation face a monumental task of cleaning up the mess created by the storms.
The cost of repairing roads has climbed to $37.6 million for the county alone.
Major routes that remained blocked Wednesday included Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, the Angeles Crest Highway above La Canada Flintridge, state Highway 39 above Azusa, Bouquet Canyon road above Newhall, Topanga Canyon Boulevard near Fernwood, the Sierra Highway between Palmdale and La Canada Flintridge and Malibu Canyon Road above Malibu.
The storm damage included bridge failures, flooding, pavement breakup, rock slides, failed retaining walls and erosion.
On Malibu Canyon Road, firefighters used their hoses to try to clear a tall pile of fallen rocks, taking time out to pull out a horse that got stuck chest deep in mud.
The hoses weren't powerful enough to wash away the slide, and officials said they would try explosives on Thursday.
Other major routes that remain closed by slides, washouts or bridge failures include parts of Mulholland Drive and a stretch of Stadium Way between Elysian Park and Chavez Ravine, near Dodger Stadium.
City officials said more than 2000 potholes had been repaired since Friday, with hundreds more to go.Sixteen more homes were red tagged in the Glassell Park neighborhood, raising the total marked unfit for habitation in the city of Los Angeles to at least 43.
Another 70 homes in the city had been marked with yellow tags, indicating that access was allowed only during daytime hours.
In Pasadena, six houses were red tagged in the San Rafael District.
In Orange County, three homes had been destroyed by slides and 13 more were threatened.

A winter storm pummeled Southern California on Monday for the third straight day, claiming the lives of three people and raising fears of mudslides even as homes around the region were evacuated.
The downpour is expected to drop up to 3 more inches by Wednesday, making this the wettest year on record in Los Angeles through the end of February.
Mudslides killed a 63 year old man in Woodland Hills and a teenager in Orange County, and forced the evacuation of homes in Glendale, Pasadena, Bel Air and coastal La Conchita.
A 47 year old Los Angeles civil engineer died late Sunday when he fell into a house size sinkhole in Sun Valley.
Across the Southland, freeways jammed.
Commuter train service stalled.
Wind and lightning knocked out power to thousands.
Nickel size hail fell on downtown Los Angeles.
And farmers, weary of near record rains, worried about millions in potential crop damage.
Residents, meanwhile, struggled to repair leaky roofs as retailers reported a run on rain gear, umbrellas and windshield wipers.
"Enough already with the rain.
It's been really, really bad driving," said Denise Elder, 58, a nurse who lives off Mulholland Drive in Woodland Hills.
"I feel every time I go up Topanga, the hill's going to fold in on me."
Early Monday, rescue workers recovered the body of civil engineer Rory Shaw, who drowned after tumbling into the massive Sun Valley sinkhole 150 feet wide by 30 feet deep, officials said.
Mayor James Hahn, who had visited the site just hours earlier, ordered flags lowered to half staff in honor of the Department of Public Works employee.
Robert Wickham, 63, was killed about 2:30 a.m. when a 4 foot wall of mud ripped through his home in the 4100 block of Natoma Avenue in Woodland Hills, officials said.
In Orange County, 16 year old Caitlin Oto died when huge boulders crashed through her family's home east of Irvine.
And in Silver Lake, three people were briefly trapped inside a one story house that slid 30 feet down a hill, and three nearby homes were evacuated as a precaution.
The home at 1459 Angelus Ave. slid down the slope just before 6 p.m.
The occupants escaped without serious injury.
Rainfall by Monday was more than 32 inches in downtown, more than three times the average to date of 9.89 inches and on the way to beating the annual record of 38.18 inches set in 1883 84.
By 6 p.m. Monday, Burbank had received 0.57 of an inch, Thousand Oaks 2.4 inches, Lancaster 0.77 of an inch and downtown Los Angeles 2.79 inches.
The mountains got 4 feet to 8 feet of snow above 5000 feet.
Forecasters predicted a 70 percent chance of rain today, with a 40 percent chance of showers Wednesday.
To coordinate its storm response, Los Angeles opened its Emergency Operations Center, with Hahn reporting that the city will likely be forced to dip into its reserves to pay for storm related overtime pay.
"This is a powerful storm," Hahn said during a watery press conference.
"We're asking people if they don't need to be on the road, stay home."
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power reported 3500 to 4000 scattered power outages in Woodland Hills, Van Nuys and Venice Beach.
Southern California Edison Co. reported 3200 outages, mostly in Palos Verdes.
Since Friday's storm, 230000 customers have gone without power.
"As soon as we make some headway we lose ground," said Edison spokesman Steve Conroy.
By Monday afternoon, firefighters had responded to 1000 storm related calls three times the normal service complaints.
Residents with leaky roofs and chimneys flocked to such stores as Home Depot for tarps, roofing cement and rain gear.
"The calls are nonstop," said Greg Killick of At Home Services at the Home Depot in Woodland Hills, while telling one man how to cover a leaky chimney.
"We've run out of rain gear."
Woodland Hills resident Peter Lauer, new tarp in hand, woke up to the sound of rainwater dripping on his Taylor guitar, the fault of a leaky chimney.
Many didn't sleep on account of the rain and concerns about leaks or floods.
"I was up in the attic with a flashlight last night, I was so scared," said Cheryl Plantz, 50, of Woodland Hills, whose sump pump has worked overtime to suck water from her hillside home basement.
In the coastal Ventura County community of La Conchita, six of 39 remaining residents who had survived last month's mudslide elected to leave during the night.
In Glendale, 30 residents in eight homes were evacuated because of mudslides and floods.
"I just heard a deafening roar and thought it was thunder," said Leo Saragueta, a retiree from Glendale who was forced to leave his home.
"But then we heard trees cracking and snapping, and the scariest part is we couldn't see."
In all, seven homes in Los Angeles were red tagged preventing residents from entry and 25 more are yellow tagged for limited access because of the storm.
Baghdassar Sukiassians awoke in the middle of the night to the sound of a massive eucalyptus tree crashing through his roof.
"We thought first it was an explosion," said the Woodland Hills resident, who awoke to branches poking through his ceiling.
Mud also played havoc on the roadways, where a slide caused a SigAlert on the 405 Freeway at Interstate 5 early Monday.
According to Caltrans, Palmdale Boulevard (Highway 138) will remain closed from the Golden State Freeway to the Antelope Valley Freeway until crews can clean up mud and debris spilling across the road.
In Ventura County, Highway 126 was closed between Fillmore and Piru and Highway 33 is washed out from Wheeler Campground to Lockwood Valley Road.
Metrolink canceled some commuter train service north of Moorpark and Amtrak curtailed northbound service between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara.
Because of mudslides, the MTA Gold Line was forced onto a single track between Highland Park and Pasadena.
Farmers in Ventura County, already socked with nearly $52 million in storm related damages, cautiously eyed their rain covered fields.
Strawberry field workers struggled through mud to stop rot and mold, while other farmers struggled to clear their crops.
"It's making it really hard to get the vegetables out of the ground," said Scott Deardorff, co owner of Deardorff Jackson Co. in Camarillo and Fillmore, with 900 acres of lettuce, celery and cauliflower.
"Right now, it's more of an annoyance and a disruption, but if it goes on too much longer it's going to be a problem."
Daily News Staff Writers Kerry Cavanaugh, Brent Hopkins, Jason Kandell and Lisa Mascaro and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
With the search for victims of a deadly mudslide over, some residents of this oceanfront town prepared to return to their homes despite being warned of the danger of another collapse.
"There's no place you can live in the world without danger," said Mike Bell, 57.
"It's no greater danger than anywhere else."
The death toll stood at 10 in the beach community devastated by Monday's torrent of dirt and trees, and everyone on the list of missing people had been located.
Thirteen homes were destroyed and 18 others were damaged.
The entire town of about 260 people was evacuated Monday.
But Ventura County Sheriff Bob Brooks said Thursday that officials have no authority to stop people from returning if their homes have been determined safe.
Authorities planned to meet with residents Friday to discuss a specific plan for their return.
"Now it's time to rebuild the community, and that's what we're here to do," said Ventura County Fire Chief Bob Roper.
Still, if they had their way, Roper and Brooks said people would never return to the beachfront town situated at the base of towering cliffs that have collapsed twice in 10 years following heavy rains.
"We believe that the La Conchita community is a geologically hazardous area," Brooks said Thursday.
"It has been historically, it is today, and it will remain so.
We do not recommend that people return to this area or the people who stay here remain here."
The warning was enough for West Aycock, who said he is not willing to risk his infant son's life.
"I don't want him there," said Aycock, 23.
"He's too little.
He's all I care about.
I don't know what's going to happen with the mountain anymore.
I don't know if it's going to come down or what."
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger visited La Conchita, and has declared a state emergency.
Rescue workers stopped digging on Thursday after authorities determined everyone on a list of missing people had been located.
The mudslides were just one facet of the deadly storms that pummeled California this month.
Including the 10 mudslide victims, 28 people died in California during five days of constant, torrential rain that ended Tuesday.
The storms may cost the state more than $100 million (euro75 million) in damage to homes, roads and farms, according to initial estimates from state officials and farm and insurance groups.
(Eds: Updates with Highway 101 flooding) LOS ANGELES A winter storm pummeled Southern California on Monday for the third straight day, claiming the lives of three people and raising fears of mudslides even as homes around the region were evacuated.
The downpour is expected to drop up to 3 more inches by Wednesday, making this the wettest year on record in Los Angeles through the end of February.
A brief yet extremely powerful storm cell paralyzed Hollywood just before 7 p.m., forcing the California Highway Patrol to close all lanes of the Hollywood Freeway at Santa Monica Boulevard where the runoff turned the freeway into a raging river.
Runoff from the cell, which dumped rain at a rate of more than 2 inches per hour, trapped more than a dozen motorists in their vehicles as water on the freeway quickly rose to their windows, said CHP Officer Vince Ramirez.
Traffic was diverted to surface streets at Santa Monica and Sunset boulevards, but heavy flooding plagued city streets, bringing the evening commute to a near halt in Hollywood.
"There were about 25 square blocks where flooding took place," said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey.
"Several people were trapped in the rapidly rising water in Koreatown and Southeast Hollywood, and many of them were rescued.
"Luckily there were no reports of serious injury."
Earlier, mudslides killed a 63 year old man in Woodland Hills and a teenager in Orange County, and forced the evacuation of homes in Glendale, Pasadena, Bel Air and coastal La Conchita.

In scenes reminiscent of the aftermath of the Northridge Earthquake 11 years ago this month, Los Angeles area residents faced gridlocked freeways and roads Wednesday while cleanup crews cleared mud, rubble and debris left from a two week siege of rain.
On a brilliantly sunny day, it was a nightmare getting to work and schools or even running routine errands.
The San Fernando Valley was especially hard hit, with morning traffic backed up for miles on the Ventura and San Diego freeways as canyon cut throughs to the Westside remained shut down.
The evening commute was just as bad.
"The 405, a parking lot," said CHP Officer Tariq Johnson.
"Right now ,there's quite a few closures still in effect."
Countless streets across Los Angeles County remained closed by flooding and mud as crews worked to dig out the debris.
"This is certainly a significant event,The road closures have made it hard for some people to travel to work, to get around and do their normal daily routines," said Ken Pellman, spokesman for the county's Public Works Department.
"In that way it's been disruptive much the same way the earthquake was in '94.
The California Highway Patrol reported back ups on the eastbound Ventura Freeway that stretched nearly to Ventura County during the morning rush.
"The 101 405 interchange was very, very busy," said CHP West Valley spokesman Officer Leland Tang.
"I think what happened was ,all the connectors to the Westside the canyon connectors Laurel Canyon, Coldwater Canyon (were closed).
Beverly Glen was overflooded with traffic.
Sepulveda Boulevard had traffic as well.
"Everyone got frustrated with those two alternates and went over to the freeway."
The city reopened Laurel Canyon and Coldwater Canyon boulevards during the evening commute, but at reduced speeds of 10 mph amid risks of falling rocks.
Caltrans hoped to get Topanga Canyon Boulevard opened sometime today after blowing up a giant boulder and hauling it away in pieces.
But huge headaches remain with the 101 Freeway still shut down at the site of the deadly La Conchita mudslide between Ventura and Santa Barbara.
The only alternative requires a four hour detour.
Caltrans hopes to reopen the highway by Friday.
"We have crews working around the clock, working shoulder to shoulder with the fire department and the California Highway Patrol," said Caltrans spokeswoman Jeanne Bonfilio.
"We're very hopeful that once 101 reopens ,that will help commuters."
Even more, the southbound Golden State Freeway was shut down Wednesday morning to one lane at Templin Highway because of pavement damage, jamming the main artery coming into Los Angeles County.
It's unclear when the 5 will get back to normal.
"It certainly is a major north south artery.
We're going to be working very hard to get that open as soon as possible as well," Bonfilio said.
The region has been hammered by the 15 wettest days on record after a series of cold storms beginning after Christmas unleashed a fury on Southern California.
The beating has left dozens of streets impassable by floods, mudslides and debris, while others are rough riding with countless potholes.
Road repairs will cost the region millions.
So far, Caltrans estimates it's spending $11 million just on immediate repairs, while the county said it will spend $40 million on roads and other public works repairs.
The city of Los Angeles estimates $10 million in public and private losses, but could not break out road repair costs separately.
"There's certainly work to do," said Caltrans' Bonfilio.
"When you consider the hundreds and hundreds of miles of freeways, and the millions of miles that are traveled on these freeways on a daily basis, our freeways held up."
Experts said the problem Wednesday was a triple whammy of people getting back to their routines, roads still closed and thousands of Los Angeles Unified School District students back from holiday break this week.
The CHP had urged motorists to stay home during the rains.
"Now that it's stopped raining, people are coming out again.
That's for sure a big impact," said CHP spokeswoman Officer Rebecca Estrada.
"We did notice that when it was raining toward this last week people were adhering to what we were saying,There weren't as many people out there, as opposed to now, when it isn't raining, traffic is (back) to its normal go, as to congestion."'
The CHP logged 292 incidents from 5 a.m. to noon on county freeways, compared with 246 the previous Wednesday.
Transit service, too, has suffered setbacks.
Amtrak has halted its Pacific Surfliner route between San Diego and San Luis Obispo because of mudslides in Orange County and a sinkhole and rocks near Santa Barbara.
Metrolink had to shut down three stations in Ventura County where tracks are washed out by the rains, busing passengers to the station in Moorpark.
Still, Metrolink spokeswoman Denise Tyrrell said, ridership numbers are up.
"We are able to move people faster than the freeways when there's this poor weather.
That gives you some idea how bad those highways are."
Some said while the destruction wasn't as obvious as the fallen freeways after the Jan 17, 1994, Northridge Quake, the number of closures across the region had a somewhat similar impact on commutes.
Many roads will remain shut down for some time.
Across Ventura County, main routes between communities are closed, with reopen dates set for weeks from now.
Similarly, Los Angeles County's main mountain cut through, State Route 2, is shut down at Angeles Crest Highway, as are other routes in the San Gabriel Valley.
County public works crews were getting roads blocked by mudslide and debris reopened "by the hour," Pellman said.
But those with structural damage will take longer to repair.
"(The closures are) not going to last months there might be a few because of structural reasons.
The vast majority of the roads are going to be open in days."
Caltrans said it hoped to reopen connectors between the Long Beach and Santa Monica freeways today.
John Sapone, the city's street services superintendent, said his office has received more than 1000 calls for pothole repairs four times normal and that crews will work Saturday and Sunday to get the job done.
However, other street repairs such as washed away gutters or alligator cracks will have to wait, and get in line on the city's long list of needed street repairs.
The city had 460 reports of trees or branches blocking roads and was pumping sewage in Eagle Rock to keep it from overflowing into streets.
"We're just asking them to be patient, we'll get to them," said Linda Aparicio, a Department of Public Works spokeswoman.
"By Sunday, everything should be looking really good."
Californians braced for even more rain as they struggled to recover from storms that have left at least nine people dead, triggered mudslides and tornadoes, and washed away roads and runways.
Among the victims was a Nevada woman caught in an avalanche while cross country skiing near Lake Tahoe, and a 16 year old Orange County girl doing homework on a computer when a mudslide crashed through the wall of her home.
In Ventura County, officials closed the small Santa Paula airport Tuesday after more than 155 feet (46.5 meters) of runway collapsed into the rushing Santa Clara River.
Chunks of concrete crumbled into the water throughout the day.
"We've lost nearly the entire west third of the airport," said Rowena Mason, president of the Santa Paula Airport Association.
"This is millions and millions of dollars worth of damage."
Rescues occurred across the state, including a woman who was pulled Tuesday from rushing, waist high waters of the Rio Hondo River in Montebello.
Forecasters said another strong system expected early Wednesday could bring severe winds and drop an additional inch or more of rain on Southern California.
Despite brief glimpses of sun, a flash flood watch was in effect across much of Southern California on Tuesday.
A tornado warning was also issued for coastal areas.
Authorities said dozens of homes were evacuated or red tagged marked as uninhabitable because they threatened to collapse from sliding hillsides.
Mudslides forced Amtrak officials to suspend train service north of Los Angeles to Santa Barbara at least through Thursday.
The wild weather came from a series of storms that began battering the state on Thursday, dumping 8.15 inches (20.7 centimeters) of rain on downtown Los Angeles.
A total of 33.09 inches ( 84.05 centimeters) of rain has fallen in the city since July 1, when California begins its yearly rainfall measurements.
The record, 38.18 inches (96.98 centimeters), was set in 1883 1884.
Storms have caused $52.5 million (euro39.8 million) in damage to Los Angeles County roads and facilities since the beginning of the year.
The county has spent $9 million (euro6.8 million) on repairs, including $500000 (euro378989) since the weekend, officials said.
Mayor James Hahn asked Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to urge President George W. Bush to issue a federal disaster declaration for the city, which could open the way for federal assistance.
The mayor said damage exceeded $10 million (euro7.84 million).
Northern California also was hit by severe thunderstorms and hail.
Trees were uprooted and roofs and fences damaged by two small tornadoes near Sacramento.
Rain in Northern California tapered off Tuesday, with only isolated showers expected by Wednesday, said Bob Benjamin, a NWS forecaster.
Shippers scrambled for alternative routes Wednesday as Union Pacific Corp. struggled to overcome what it said was a "probably unprecedented" disruption of service in Southern California because of the recent rains.
Mother Nature might be to blame for Union Pacific's latest woes, but the recurring problems the railroad has had moving goods in and out of the region, coupled with recent backlogs at local ports, could threaten the economy, shipping experts and economists said.
"If I'm a shipper, I'm starting to get disturbed about being able to use Southern California as a base to get stuff into the country and out to my stores," said John Husing, an independent economist in Redlands, Calif.
Citing mudslides and washed out tracks and bridges, Union Pacific closed four of its five main rail lines out of the Los Angeles Basin.
That brought the railroad's freight traffic in the region to a near standstill.
The company said it was racing to make track repairs and hoped to resume limited service on Thursday.
Union Pacific's troubles included 23 mudslides that covered tracks in the Cajon Pass east of Los Angeles, a key passageway from Southern California to Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, and eventually to the Midwest.
"We have been told that the route from Los Angeles to Chicago has effectively been closed," said Scott Dailey, a spokesman for APL, a leading shipper of intermodal cargo containers and a unit of Neptune Orient Lines of Singapore.
The fresh disruption coming on top of last year's gridlock at local ports and railways persuaded APL to decide to permanently send "a lot of our transcontinental cargo" to Seattle rather than Los Angeles, he said.
"That is a major shift."
Decisions like that and Union Pacific's not infrequent difficulties, in addition to bottlenecks at the ports, "certainly should cause people to think about the whole infrastructure" in Southern California, said Jim McKenna, president of the Pacific Maritime Association, which represents West Coast shipping lines.
Husing said the "real damage is the continuing problems we have, whether it's 93 ships tied up off the coast or Union Pacific not being able to get its cargo through the area."
Union Pacific, which was suffering major congestion problems on its tracks before the heavy rainfall, is the nation's largest railroad, with 33000 miles of track from the West to the Midwest.
Based in Omaha, Neb., it is one of two railroads that ferry goods from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach the world's busiest port complex north and east to the rest of the country.
The other is Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. About half of the raw materials and finished goods that arrive at the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, mostly from Asia, are transported by truck to destinations in Southern California.
The rest is forwarded nationwide by rail, with Union Pacific and Burlington Northern each handling about half of that freight.
Burlington Northern suffered no major setbacks from the storms, a spokesman said, and is carrying some freight for Union Pacific.
Some analysts wondered why the nasty weather affected Union Pacific and not Burlington Northern.
In the Cajon Pass, for instance, the railroads' tracks nearly parallel each other west of Interstate 15.
But Union Pacific tracks are higher in elevation than Burlington Northern's are, Union Pacific spokesman John Bromley said, and thus were first to be hit by mudslides.
The damage was even more pronounced, Bromley said, because "the slides have occurred in areas where we've had all the forest fires and the ground cover was burned off."
Union Pacific's stock fell 38 cents Wednesday to $63.96 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Jan 12: Here we are, three weeks into winter, and the season has delivered almost every kind of weather it has to deliver: waterspouts off Ventura, Calif., ice storms in the central Plains, glacial fog in the Texas Panhandle, profound depths of snow in the Sierra Nevada, flooding in the Ohio Valley and an all too familiar mix of ice, snow and rain in the Northeast.
Nowhere has winter been more impressive this year than in Southern California.
Los Angeles has already had some 5 inches more than its annual rainfall in the last two weeks, including a record 2.6 inches on Sunday.
The numbers do not really convey the effect of all that water, combined with powerful storm surges along the coast.
Mudslides have closed freeways and caused evacuations and some deaths.
Every creek and river dry streambeds for most of the year has swollen to a dangerous tide of dark water.
Vast stretches of the Mojave Desert have been inundated by the unstinting rain.
In the Central Valley, water stands in the fields, washing out the hope of some crops.
In Bakersfield, which averages less than 6 inches of rainfall a year, the rain fell in sheets on Sunday and Monday, turning highways into long columns of vehicle beaten spray.
There is temporary respite coming.
Good weather will hit Southern California later this week, and the Northeast has enjoyed some mild intervals.
And this much moisture in the arid West always promises good news, despite the chaotic way it has come.
But no matter how good the weather gets for a few days in mid January, the bulk of winter lies ahead.
It's hard to imagine what it may bring.
As stormy weather continued to pound Southern California on Saturday, about 170 people were freed from cars near Big Bear where they had been trapped for up to 15 hours in deep snow, several of the state's major arteries were closed and rescue workers pulled two people from raging streams.
Serious concerns remained about how the water logged region would hold up with storms expected to continue at least through Sunday evening.
Although there appeared to be no major flooding or mudslides, the day was not without drama.
Rescue workers used snowplows, snowcats and snowmobiles to free people from a 6 mile stretch of California Highway 18 in the San Bernardino Mountains after a combination of snow, rain, sleet and fog created a 200 vehicle logjam.
Although many of those stuck along the route spent the night in their cars, there were no major injuries.
In Rosemead, rescuers plucked a woman from a wash after water carried her nearly a quarter of a mile.
San Bernardino County firefighters used a bulldozer to rescue a man from a swollen waterway.
Several of the state's major arteries were closed because of snow, rock slides and weather related accidents.
Cities along the coast received from 1 to 4 inches of rain, while mountain regions reported as much as 8 inches.
The California Highway Patrol reported 430 accidents as of 6 p.m. in Southern California double last Saturday's total for the same time period.
Forecasters expected rain to continue most of Sunday before diminishing.
A flood watch remained in effect for Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, and flash flood warnings remained for San Bernardino County.
Times staff writers Jason Felch, Jack Leonard, David Pierson and Joel Rubin and staff photographer Rob Gauthier contributed to this report.
Usually sunny southern California has been whipped the past few days by storms that have killed at least two and caused floods, mudslides, power blackouts and deadly traffic accidents.
A man died and another was injured in Los Angeles' Elysian Park when a hillside collapsed and buried the two in the tent in which they were sleeping on Saturday night, officials said.
The victims "were sleeping in a tent at the top of the hill when the hill gave way," Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said.
In Malibu, on the Pacific coast, an accident caused by the rain sent a car into the ocean, leaving one dead and four wounded.
A man and his two children were rescued from the rubble of their hillside home in Studio City after it collapsed in a heavy downpour.
The three were taken to hospital with minor injuries.
Residents of Santa Clarita had to be evacuated due to floods while the Coldwater Canyon neighborhood of Los Angeles was strewn with fallen trees.
The latest storm started Thursday and was predicted to continue Monday with more rain and, in the mountains, snow.
Hundreds of cars were stranded in the snow in San Bernardino National Forest, east of Los Angeles.
About 12000 Los Angeles residents were without power, officials said.
"This is something we only see about every five to 10 years," National Weather Service Meteorologist Dan Keeton said of the turbulent weather.
A fourth day of thrashing thunderstorms began to take a heavier toll on southern California on Sunday with at least three deaths blamed on the rain, as flooding and mudslides forced road closures and emergency crews carried out harrowing rescue operations.
In Elysian Park, just north of downtown, a 42 year old homeless man was killed and another injured when a mudslide swept away their makeshift encampment.
Another man was killed on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu when his sport utility vehicle skidded into a mud patch and plunged into the Pacific Ocean.
Ventura County officials reported Sunday that a 20 year old man died north of Ojai as he tried to cross a rain gorged creek Saturday, wearing a harness attached to a wire.
For others, it was a day of close calls.
Dozens of people fled threatened neighborhoods from Santa Clarita to San Dimas.
In the Hollywood Hills, a family narrowly survived as their two story home collapsed, apparently in a torrent of mud.
Hundreds of motorists skidded into minor traffic accidents.
Unresolved Sunday was the fate of a Highland man who remained stranded but safe in a San Bernardino County cave as raging waters outside prevented rescuers from reaching him.
"The only way to get to the cave is to cross this water, (but) it's flowing too heavily.
It's too dangerous," said Cindy Beavers, a spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.
The storms had stalled over an area of the Pacific Ocean on Sunday evening, a few hundred miles off the coast of Point Conception, west of Santa Barbara, said Bruce Rockwell, a weather specialist with the National Weather Service.
"It's stationary off the coast and constantly pumps in moist water from the south," he said.
Forecasters had originally said some areas of southern California might receive more than 20 inches of precipitation over the weekend.
Although they later reduced that estimate, a campground near Mount Wilson, Opids Camp, received 20.8 inches of precipitation just between 4 p.m. Saturday and 4 p.m. Sunday.
In that same time period, downtown Los Angeles received 4.5 inches of rain, Beverly Hills 7.8 inches, Santa Monica 4.7 inches, Chatsworth 5.8 inches, Claremont 7.5 inches and Lancaster 2.4 inches.
Continued downpours were expected through Tuesday, when the jet stream airflow from the north was expected to start pushing the storm inland toward Nevada.
Southern California has been drenched by a string of storms that began in late December and have been only sporadically interrupted by clear skies.
The current dousing, which began Thursday, has been the heaviest.
On average, Los Angeles receives 18 inches of rain in the first six months of each year, but more than 15 inches have fallen in the first nine days of 2005.
All across the Southland, residents dealt with rockslides, debris flows, downed trees, power outages and mandatory evacuations, though there were few serious injuries.
Mudslides, a sinkhole and other water damage forced Metrolink and Amtrak to cancel some train routes serving Los Angeles and Ventura Counties on Monday.
In Orange County, a combination of storm runoff and big surf caused health officials to close Corona del Mar State Beach in Newport Beach and Capistrano County Beach in Dana Point because of sewage pipe leaks.
More than 300 miles away in the Eastern Sierra, skiers and snowboarders glided atop 48 inches of snow that has fallen on Mammoth Mountain since Friday.
"We've just been pounded," said Joani Lynch, a Mammoth Mountain spokeswoman.
Some ski runs were closed at Big Bear Mountain Resorts because of heavy rains.
In Los Angeles County, the Department of Water and Power reported thousands of power outages in homes from Echo Park to Bel Air.
A rain related accident on Mount Wilson tore down transmission lines, interrupting the broadcast of the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos playoff game on KCBS for two hours.
And in Arcadia, eight of nine horse races at Santa Anita Park were canceled for the first time in 10 years because of rain.
"If it gets slippery, it could potentially be dangerous to horses, jockeys and all involved," said park spokesman Vince Bruun.
Heavy rain fell in other parts of California, but the storms in the Southland presented the biggest challenges.
The 42 year old homeless man who died in Elysian Park had been living with a younger acquaintance in a tent on top of a hill on the 1700 block of Stadium Way, just north of the Pasadena Freeway.
The man, identified as Jeffrey Lynn Earwood, was trapped under hundreds of pounds of thick mud, according to Los Angles City Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said.
When rescue workers arrived, they said, only one of his limbs was visible.
Humphrey said firefighters dug him out in less than 10 minutes, but he died at the scene.
The other man, who was unidentified, received minor injuries.
The victim in the Malibu traffic accident died after the SUV he was traveling in skidded off the road in the 19700 block of PCH. Los Angeles County fire rescue workers recovered the man's body about 500 feet from where the vehicle went into the water off Tuna Canyon Beach, said Lt. Randall Dickey of the Malibu Lost Hills Sheriff's Station.
Four passengers in the car sustained minor injuries, Dickey said.
Names and ages of the victims were not released.
On Laurel Canyon Boulevard, three people were safe after their 5000 square foot house collapsed, apparently the result of a mudslide.
An unidentified motorist helped the father pull his 5 year old daughter out of the rubble, authorities said.
Firefighters rescued the man's 10 year son.
The family was hospitalized with minor injuries.
Humphrey said this was one of a number of areas where mudslides caused problems.
"Choose your street with 'Canyon' in the name, and that likely has been impacted by mud."
Around 4 p.m., "tons of mud" from a hillside slid into the third floor of a home in Silver Lake, , trapping a man inside, he said.
Firefighters had to break a window in the home in the 1900 block of North Lucile Avenue to reach the man, who was uninjured.
The fire department also evacuated three other nearby homes.
In Tujunga, five people were evacuated from the 6200 block of Gyral Drive after a mudslide near the Angeles National Forest, Humphrey said.
No one was injured, though one house was damaged.
People in 15 houses farther down the street were advised to leave.
Humphrey estimated that more than 100 roads in Los Angeles had seen flooding or mudslides or downed trees.
"Most of the incidents are minor, and people do their civic duty with shovels in the mud."

Part of a rain saturated hillside gave way on Monday, sending a Mississippi like torrent of earth and trees onto four blocks of this oceanfront town and killing three men.
About 12 people were known to be missing.
A spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department, Joe L. Luna, said 10 people were injured and all but one or two had been taken to a hospital for treatment.
A helicopter took a 62 year old man to a hospital, where he was listed in critical condition.
At least three or four people were pulled alive from the debris over the course of the day, including a woman in the early evening who was "pretty seriously injured," Eric Nishimoto, a spokesman for the Ventura County sheriff's department, said.
La Conchita was the site of a similar but smaller landslide in 1995.
"This one came down quickly and suddenly, and very violently," Luna said.
Fifteen to 20 homes were hit, he said.
The disaster was the latest problem caused by the rain and snow that have battered California since Dec 25. Meteorologists say Southern California has not been hit by this much rain in nearly 40 years.
Downtown Los Angeles has had more than 15 inches of rain since Jan 1, more than its average rainfall for an entire year, including 2.6 inches on Sunday, a record, the National Weather Service said.
Officials said they were concerned about the possibility of more mudslides.
Rescuers expected to work through the night searching for the missing people.
"It's very sad," said Kirk Peterson, who has lived here for a year and whose house was undamaged.
"We've lost a few friends."
His wife, Dawn, said, "We're hoping they're not buried."
Terrin Wharton was in her house with her husband and two children when the hill came down.
She said the rubble had stopped just to the side of her house but engulfed her neighbor's.
"The cops put a hole in our wall" to search for survivors next door, Wharton said.
La Conchita is a sliver of a town between the Pacific Ocean and scenic bluffs just south of the Santa Barbara County line.
The bluffs, saturated by Pacific borne storms that began on Friday, were known to be unstable, and Ventura County fire officials asked residents on Monday morning to leave voluntarily.
About 200 complied, boarding government provided buses, Myra Raya, a spokeswoman for the Fire Department, said.
"Most people chose to leave, but a few did not," Raya said.
Rescue workers, including a team from neighboring Los Angeles County, worked into the evening, combing the debris for the living and the dead and keeping a wary eye on the hillside and the sky.
On Monday evening, the rain returned.
Fearing another slide, officials ordered some crews to move to the coastal highway, which was closed from Ventura and Santa Barbara.
Elsewhere, a 2 year old drowned on Sunday in Palmdale, in the desert, after slipping from her mother's grasp when helicopter rescuers tried to lift them from a car that had been swallowed in a torrent.
The child's body was recovered a few hours later.
The authorities are considering bringing charges against the mother, whose name they did not release, because she had driven around barricades and into the rushing water.
In Los Angeles, a saturated hillside gave way in Elysian Park, burying a homeless man who was waiting out the weather in his encampment.
His companion was injured.
Also on Sunday, a motorist drowned near Malibu when he hit a mud patch on the Pacific Coast Highway and skidded off the road into the ocean.
A 20 year old in Ventura County died on Sunday when he tried to cross a raging creek in a harness attached to a wire.
Road accidents on Sunday numbered 720, more than three times the total of the previous Sunday, when the roads were dry, the California Highway Patrol said.
One hundred roads and highways in Los Angeles County were closed because of flooding and rock slides, clogging traffic.
A confluence of tropical air from the South Pacific and a cold front barreling down from the north have created the extraordinary weather across the West.
On Friday, Las Vegas was coated in a freak snow squall.
The Sierras have had 4 feet of snow, and forecasters expect 5 feet more by midweek.
The airport in Reno, Nev., was closed twice in a week.
The region has not had so much snow since 1916.
More than 6000 houses were without power on Monday in Los Angeles, where county officials estimate the property damage is in excess of $19 million.
The downpours are part of the fundamentally chaotic and occasionally extreme nature of the atmosphere, said William Patzert, an oceanographer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
He said Los Angeles had not seen such intensity and such a pattern of winter downpours since the fall and winter of 1889 90. Patzert said that the snowpack in the north could help bolster water supplies for Southern California but that the torrential rains would not slake the longstanding drought. "
It's like trying to fill a glass full of water when someone is shooting a fire hose at you," he said.
"Seventy five to 80 percent will end up in the ocean."
Southern California, it is widely said, has two seasons: fire and flood.
Landslides are not freak occurrences.
The 1995 slide in La Conchita was 600000 tons and destroyed or damaged 14 houses.
Even then, despite warnings to leave, some residents stayed.
After the slide on Monday, evacuation was made mandatory.
Super saturated land tumbled down a mountain Monday in the coastal community of La Conchita, Calif., killing at least one person and injuring many more, fire officials said.
"We have one dead and numerous injuries," said Myrna Raya, fire information officer for the Ventura County Fire Department.
Rescuers were searching through the mud for survivors, she said.
It was unknown how many people were trapped, at least six people were taken to area hospitals.
The death brought to 10 the number of people killed in Southern California during the past weekend's storm, one of three bringing record precipitation across the state.
Mike and Barbara Bell, residents of La Conchita since 1983, said the landslide struck without warning about 1:15 p.m. PST.
The Bells, who live on a street away from the slide, said they were cleaning up mud when they heard the slide.
"We were standing on the street and just talking and somebody said, 'Oh my God!' and then the hill came down," Mike Bell said.
"It covered the same three or four houses it hit the first time, then came across the street and hit six or seven more houses.
It clearly destroyed them.
It just blew them apart.
"Now I've got to get a backhoe and try to save my own house.
The mudslide's at the other end of the street, but every time we get a torrential rain the mud flow comes right down my street.
I've got to go if I'm going to save my house," he said.
Kathleen Wood, who has lived in the community since 1985, was taking a walk with a friend through La Conchita when the slide occurred.
"I looked up and saw a cloud of dust.
It was silent and then it really came down.
It snapped the retaining wall," she said.
(Begin optional trim) Sam and Cynthia Ficklend, whose family had been going up to La Conchita on vacation for the last 50 years, moved to the seaside community two years ago.
They were going home to put things in crates and boxes and looking for their cat.
"We thought we'd retired to paradise," Cynthia Ficklend said.
"Well, paradise is over."
(End optional trim) La Conchita is a small community fronted by U.S. 101, about 60 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.
It was also struck by a major landslide in 1995.
The fifth day of thrashing storms took a heavy toll on Southern California as the rain swelled streams and rivers and undermined the integrity of the ground.
(Begin optional trim) A slackening rainfall was expected to bring some relief for evening commuters, a step up from the morning drive, which was a treacherous game of stop and go.
Delays and some closures were reported on most major roads.
Because many secondary roads were closed, traffic was forced onto the highways, further clogging the principal routes.
Where roads were open, sizable delays of more than an hour were reported in many areas.
Schools in some parts of the region were forced to close for the day.
Glendale Community College canceled evening classes because of a nearby mudslide.
(End optional trim) An estimated 6000 customers in Los Angeles were reported without power Monday afternoon.
Earlier , Monday, the body of a 2 year old girl was recovered in Palmdale, a high desert town in far northeastern Los Angeles County.
The toddler plunged to her death after slipping from her mother's grasp as they were being lifted to safety by rescuers, who responded when the family's vehicle became stuck in a flooded wash Sunday night.
Authorities said the girl's mother, whose name was not released, drove around a barrier, one of several put up by county employees in the area because of dangerously swirling creek waters caused by two weeks of stormy weather.
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Michael Handley said cars are swept away all too often when people mistakenly think they can ford swollen waterways in the area.
"It happens all the time," he said.
"I don't know what it is, the lemming mentality or something.
They're so intent on getting where they're going that they think they can drive through the flood waters."
Roads were clogged with rain and mud, and at least 720 crashes were reported Sunday, more than three times the number of accidents during the previous Sunday when streets were dry, the California Highway Patrol said.
Fire officials estimated that 100 roads in Los Angeles saw flooding, mudslides or downed trees.
By Monday morning, the National Weather service reported that downtown Los Angeles received 5.16 inches since Friday and more than 2.5 inches on Sunday alone.
Beverly Hills received 7.79 inches, the L.A. community of Eagle Rock 3.8 inches, Santa Monica 4.7 inches, and Chatsworth, in the San Fernando Valley, 5.81 inches.
According to the weather service, Los Angeles has received almost 21 inches of precipitation since July 1.
That surpasses the average annual rainfall of 15.14 inches with five months yet to go.
The rain was expected to let up Monday afternoon, , but the region will have little time to dry out.
Substantial rains were forecast for Monday night and through Tuesday.
A real break was expected by Wednesday, when clearing should take place for a few days at least.

La Conchita was the victim of a 600000 ton slide in 1995 destroying or damaging 14 houses.
Even then, despite warnings to leave, some residents stayed.
No one then was killed.
After the slide on Monday, evacuation was made mandatory.
Rescue workers using sensitive listening devices and cadaver dogs probed for buried victims on Tuesday in a 25 foot deep mountain of mud and debris left by Monday's mudslide as the rains finally ended and desperate family members kept vigil.
Bob Roper, the Ventura County fire chief, said Tuesday afternoon that monitoring equipment was still picking up faint sounds of life from the debris pile, raising the possibility of survivors.
"We're looking for any movement," Capt. Conrad Quintana of the county fire department said.
"A part of an arm.
A finger tapping.
A cough.
Someone crying.
Any indication someone is alive in there."
The missing included the wife and three children of Jimmie Wallet, a carpenter who left them briefly on Monday just before a 500 foot high rain saturated hillside above this tiny coastal hamlet collapsed.
"He was running toward the mountain while people were running away from it," said Wallet's mother, Linda Silva, who came to La Conchita on Tuesday to await word of her daughter in law and grandchildren.
"He ran up there and started digging with his hands.
He was yelling, 'I have to get my kids!
My kids!"'
Rescuers pulled three more bodies from the mud on Tuesday, bringing the official death count to six.
The collapse of the hillside here was a deadly coda to five days of merciless rains across Southern California that have left 20 dead and driven thousands from their homes under threat of floods and mudslides.
Even as skies cleared on Tuesday, 4000 people were evacuated from the banks of a surging creek in the Orange County communities of San Juan Capistrano and Dana Point.
And a hiker who had been trapped for three days in a cave by raging floodwaters in the San Bernardino Mountains was rescued by helicopter.
Among the dead across the region were a man whose body was found wedged in a tree in a canyon, a woman who was run over by her husband, who could not see her in the driving rain, and an 18 year old woman who was killed when her car hit a fallen tree.
Here in La Conchita, where as many as 12 people were missing, 14 people were also injured, two of them critically, and roughly half of the town's houses were destroyed or badly damaged.
Dozens of roads around the area remained closed because of mud or deep standing water.
Los Angeles will get a much needed break early Monday from the unforgiving rain that has pounded Southern California since Thursday, but a new front will move in Monday night, bringing with it an additional 2 inches to 4 inches of rain.
It will be the last storm at least for a while and forecasters say Southern Californians will see sunshine Tuesday, ending a wave of storms.
The latest storm wave on Sunday alone dumped 4 1/2 inches of rain downtown, 6 inches in Burbank and Chatsworth, 3.29 inches in Woodland Hills and nearly 8 inches in Beverly Hills.
"We'll begin to see some normalcy come back on Tuesday, but it's still winter," said National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Hoffer.
"We should see clear to partly cloudy skies from Tuesday all the way out to Saturday."
While there might be blue skies on the horizon, the relentless storm system that has hovered over Southern California since Thursday caused massive flooding, mudslides, power outages, several evacuations, school closures and disrupted commuter rail service.
The heavy rainfall is being attributed to a sluggish, low pressure system that collided with a stream of tropical moisture from the southern Pacific known as a "Pineapple Express."
On the third consecutive day of heavy downpours Sunday, the skies dumped up to 2 inches of rain an hour in some areas turning some streets in hillside communities into raging rivers and stranding dozens of motorists who had to be rescued by overtaxed emergency workers.
At Sun Valley's infamous intersection San Fernando Road and Tuxford Street a swift water rescue team plucked 20 year old Amber Pitts from her car after she became stuck in as much as 4 feet of water at about 6 p.m. "It was the fourth rescue we have made at that intersection (Sunday).
Luckily, she was OK," said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey.
"That intersection is always flooded when it rains, and some people decide to try to make it through."
In the Ventura County community of Bardsdale, just south of Fillmore, resident Doug Bofolo and his family had to evacuate their house just east of Highway 23 when a massive water flow overtook his property.
"The water was chest deep.
Everything was floating," Bofolo said.
"We've got a 5 foot block wall and we can't even see the top of it.
This is even worse than the flooding we got in 1969."
In Santa Clarita, residents of the Polynesian Mobile Home Park at San Fernando Road and Sierra Highway were evacuated when saturated hillsides and roadbeds gave way to the nonstop flooding.
Thirty engine companies, the Urban Search and Rescue teams and county lifeguards were deployed with more than 200 firefighters responding.
"The whole (Santa Clarita) valley (was) on alert," Los Angeles County Fire Department Capt. Dave Peterson said during Sunday's deluge.
The Fire Department reported flooding as high as second story windows at cabins along Bouquet Canyon in the Angeles National Forest.
By midafternoon, department resources were stretched thin and there was not much more that could be done to hold back mudslides.
Flooding was reported at Bouquet Canyon Road and Vasquez Canyon Road, causing a road closure.
In Saugus, firefighters led a dozen people to high ground after they were stranded on San Francisquito Canyon Road by flooding and mudslides from the rain swelled San Francisquito Creek.
Four adults and eight children were rescued by helicopter and taken to safety at a church at the mouth of San Francisquito Canyon.
Gary Brynjegard and sons Peter, 16, and Garrison, 13, of Castaic had headed into the canyon earlier to survey damage.
Brynjegard works for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which operates two plants along winding, two lane San Francisquito Canyon Road just north of Santa Clarita.
"We drove up to look around, then saw a mudslide and I said, We better get out of here," Brynjegard said.
"We ran like crazy, the mountains were sliding down around us."
In Fillmore, 145 people had to be evacuated from the El Dorado Mobile Home Park, where floodwaters began breaching their homes.
A mudslide closed Highway 126 between Fillmore and Piru, and Highway 23 between Fillmore and Moorpark was closed by a massive water flow that was a quarter mile wide.
Emergency notifications in Ventura County indicated that all schools in the Fillmore Unified School District would be closed Monday, and Metrolink said its Ventura County line will be closed Monday because of flooding and mudslides.
Metrolink said its trains will not be operating from stations at Camarillo, Oxnard or Montalvo.
Passengers are being asked to go to the Oxnard station, where buses will be provided to take them to Moorpark station.
In Ventura, fire crews rescued six residents of the evacuated Emma Wood State Beach RV park who were trapped on a rock on the Santa Clara River bottom near the West Main Street Bridge on Sunday morning.
Elsewhere in Ventura County, Sheriff's Department officials reported flooding in the Arroyo Vista Mobile Home Park in Moorpark, where residents were evacuated.
Late Saturday, a man drowned after being washed away by a swollen river north of Ojai in Ventura County, officials said.
Sunday was a long day for L.A. city and county firefighters, who responded to numerous mudslides, collapses and rescues.
A mudslide in Elysian Park buried a makeshift homeless encampment, killing one man and injuring another while they slept in a tent.
One person died and four people were hurt in a single car crash on Pacific Coast Highway near Malibu.
A two story home collapsed in the Studio City area above the San Fernando Valley, and a 33 year old man and his two children were pulled from the rubble with minor injuries.
Fire officials said the house rolled down the hill and collapsed into a pile of debris in a matter of seconds.
The rain caused a hillside to give way in the 6200 block of Gyral Drive in Sunland, damaging a home and prompting authorities to evacuate five people from three residences, Humphrey said.
And in Los Feliz, a man was rescued from a three story home built into a hillside in the 1900 block of Lucille Drive when a mudslide overran the patio and flowed into the house.
The roads in Los Angeles County were equally frustrating.
Dozens of roads and highways were closed throughout the day.
Authorities reported scores of traffic crashes and ordered scattered road closings, including the southbound side of Interstate 5 at the Pasadena Freeway because of a mudslide.
In Malibu, a rain related, single vehicle crash in the 19700 block of Pacific Coast Highway left a man dead and four other people injured just before 8 a.m.
The vehicle ended up in the ocean, said sheriff's Lt. Randall Dickey of the Malibu Lost Hills station.
The conditions of the four other people were not immediately known.
The storm drew a number of curious Southlanders out to hard hit canyon areas, further complicating the work of firefighters and other rescue workers.
Humphrey urged people to stay off the roads if they can over the next day or two of wet weather.
"Many people have been found sightseeing," which Humphrey said was "hampering the efforts of emergency officials."
As many as 12000 DWP customers lost power Sunday morning.
Pacific Gas & Electric spokesman David Eisenhauer said 11000 customers remained without power, scattered throughout the company's service area.

It was unknown when the school will reopen, she said.
Parents seeking more information should contact the school or its Web site.
The storm wreaked havoc in Northern California and Nevada as well, piling snow deeper across the Sierra Nevada, stranding an Amtrak train, knocking out service at the Reno airport and shutting down major highways across the mountains.
Forecasters called the series of storms the snowiest in the Reno Lake Tahoe area since 1916.
"I've lived here for almost 40 years and I've never seen anything like it," Peter Walenta, 69, of Stateline said Sunday.
An avalanche knocked a 13 year old boy from a ski lift at the Las Vegas Ski & Snowboard Resort, 45 miles northwest of Las Vegas, said Clark County fire spokesman Bob Leinbach.
Forecasters extended a winter storm warning into Tuesday across the Sierra and parts of northern Nevada, where as much as 2 more feet of snow was expected.
The latest storm had left up to 6 1/2 feet of snow in the Sierra and 2 1/2 feet in the Reno area.
