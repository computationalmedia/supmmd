Chinese swimmers, missing some of their stars, are eyeing Japan as the team to beat at the Asian Games in Thailand, an official report said Wednesday.
China's formidable table tennis team, also missing some veteran champions, is bracing for a challenge, too, and aiming for just four to five gold medals at the games next month, another report said.
Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan, world record holders in the women's 400 meter and 200 meter individual medleys, respectively, are leading hopefuls in the pool, the China Daily said.
Other hopefuls are Shan Ying in the women's 50 and 100 meter freestyle and new team member Chen Hua in the women's 800 and 1500 meter freestyle, the newspaper said.
Han Xue, a breaststroke short course world record holder, also has medal chances, it added.
But world record holders Le Jingyi and He Cihong will miss the games, the newspaper said.
Top butterfly swimmer Liu Limin also has left to study in the United States, it said.
"We excel in freestyle and relay events, but we are weaker in backstroke and butterfly than Japan," the newspaper quoted Zhang Xiong, the national team's head coach, as saying.
"The competition this time will be hard because two thirds of our swimmers are new," Zhang said.
"We won't let any hope of winning slip through our hands although it appears Japan may dominate."
In the men's events, China is aiming to win five of 14 swimming titles, the newspaper said.
The table tennis team, meanwhile, will be doing without veteran players Deng Yaping, Ma Wenge and Wang Tao, the China Youth Daily said.
"This indicates that the Chinese table tennis team has already completed the handover from old to new," the newspaper said.
Head coach Cai Zhenhua said the team was aiming for just four to five golds, the newspaper said.
To prepare for the games, the team went to northern Hebei province outside Beijing for three weeks of training starting Nov 8, the newspaper added.
Meanwhile, China's gymnastics team is aiming for 8 to 10 of the 14 gold medals at stake, the China Sports Daily said.
China, the overall gold medal leader at the past three games, will send 596 athletes to Thailand and compete in 32 of the 36 sports.
Sports officials have said China hopes to win more than 100 golds.
China won 137 or 41 percent of 337 gold medals at stake at the last games in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994.
Once at the top of world field hockey, India would like to have a hockey god to help regain that glory.
"Things are changing in Bangkok, and we are feeling much better," Rajinder Singh, manager of the Indian hockey squad, said Friday, a day after the Indians defeated Japan 3 2 in a warmup match for the Asian Games.
The Indians, who number 980 million, have an amazing quality of discovering gods who number in hundreds of thousands.
There is even a goddess for small pox and Indians still pray to her to keep that disease, almost eradicated, away.
"We believe in divine blessings and we hope it pours on us," said Singh.
There are so many ifs for the Indians on the way to a gold medal in the 12 nation tournament that it may well be luck besides skill and endurance needed to reach the top.
In its glory days, skill helped India win a total of eight Olympic gold medals, the most recently in 1980.
But the Indians have won an Asian Games gold medal only once, silver eight times and bronze once.
The South Koreans, who have remained a force in field hockey since winning the gold in the 1986 Asian Games at home, are clearly the favorite.
Between winning the last Asian Games gold in Hiroshima in 1994, the Koreans have figured in two World Cups, two Champions Trophy events and the Atlanta Olympics.
The Indians were silver medalists at Hiroshima, but since then have suffered a downward swing.
They placed eighth at the 1996 Olympics and one step lower in the Utrecht World Cup.
At this year's Commonwealth Games, India was out of the medals.
In Bangkok, however, there are some silver linings.
Skipper Dhanraj Pillay is a passionate player and no defense is safe against him if he gets the ball properly.
Baljit Singh Dhillon, a specialist in flick drives in goal winning penalty corners, has shaped up well.
Pakistan, India's traditional rival in the subcontinent on many issues besides sports, can also dampen the Indian hope for a comeback.
Pakistan has won the Asian Games gold medal seven times, silver twice and bronze once.
The other medalists at the Asians Games have been Malaysia with five bronzes and Japan with two.
China's swim team will hit the water at the Asian Games on Monday with a reminder of the darkest chapter in its story of drug shame.
Xiong Gouming, one of the 11 Chinese athletes who tested positive for steroids in Hiroshima four years ago, will compete in the men's 400 meter individual medley, taking his place on a team that is constantly forced to defend itself.
Head coach Zhang Xiong said Xiong Gouming "feels fine" about being back at an Asian Games.
"That was the past," said Zhang, brushing off drug questions Sunday.
"We hope that we will be clean."
The Chinese Olympic Committee tested athletes before their departure for Bangkok, and Chinese media said the swimmers were subjected to four surprise tests conducted by world governing body FINA.
"We treat this as a major issue to make sure no Chinese athletes will test positive," COC vice president Li Furong said.
Earlier this year China announced, through FINA, that any of its athletes testing positive for steroids would be banned for life.
Under those criteria, Xiong would never have had his second chance at an Asian Games.
Xiong won four golds in Hiroshima but has been mediocre since returning to international competition at the East Asian Games a year ago.
He was one of many poor performers at the world championships in Perth in January, as the Chinese appeared demoralized by yet another scandal.
After female swimmer Yuan Yuan was caught trying to smuggle 13 vials of human growth hormone through Sydney Airport, four of her teammates were nabbed with masking agents in their systems and thrown out of the games.
Chinese women swimmers won 12 of the 16 golds at stake in the 1994 Rome world championships and all 15 of their races in the 1994 Asian Games.
The team won three gold medals at this year's world championships.
Two of those went in the medley events to world record holders Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan, who will lead the Chinese team here.
Fellow world record holders Le Jingyi and He Cihong were left off a generally young squad assembled with a view ahead to the 2000 Olympics.
Japan's rising talent will test the inexperienced Chinese after a successful world championships.
Mai Nakamura, a silver medalist in the 100 meter backstroke and bronze medalist over 200, Ayari Aoyama, silver medalist in the 100 meter butterfly, and Yasuko Tajima, bronze medalist in the 400 meter medley, give the Japanese team undoubted class.
China's women divers expect to clinch Asian Games gold in the platform competition but could face stiff competition from Kazakstan in the springboard.
"If we make no big mistake, the gold should be ours," Chinese platform diver Li Na said Sunday, on the eve of the start to the diving competition.
The diminutive 14 year old, competing in her first major international competition, told China's state run Xinhua News Agency that she sees her 16 year old teammate Cai Yuyan as her main opponent in the platform.
But she acknowledged that Kazakstan's Irina Vyguzova could challenge China in the women's three meter springboard, Xinhua said.
"Irina is an excellent diver," said Li.
"If she gives her best in the competition, she has the chance to snatch the gold away from Chinese divers."
Guo Jingjing and Yang Lan will represent China in the women's springboard contest.
Thailand expects 39 countries, regions or organizations to send teams to the Asian Games, but is still waiting for confirmation from Tajikistan, Mongolia and a Palestinian team, the games' organizers said Monday.
Only Afghanistan is certain not to participate, said a press release from the organizing committee of the Dec 6 20 games in Bangkok.
The lists submitted by participants so far show 8804 athletes and officials planning to come to the games, the statement said, adding that the eventual number is expected to be 10000.
It said the Olympic Council of Asia, the region's governing sports body, had been in close contact with Tajikistan, Mongolia and the Palestinians.
"We will wait for their final reply until Nov 20," it quoted Warawut Sumon, head of Thailand's technical committee, as saying.
"At the same time, we are taking into consideration that some teams may not make it to the regional games."
Last week, Afghanistan said it would not send a team to the games because it could not afford the expense.
It added that its sports minister and a second representative might show up to carry the flag as a ceremonial gesture.
The organizers also said Monday that the Olympic Council of Asia and the International Olympic Committee are both withholding recognition of Afghanistan's national organizing committee for the games because two separate parties claim to represent it.
All programs, participation and budgetary allocations for Afghanistan's committee have been frozen, it quoted Abdul Muttaleb Ahmad, OCA director general, as saying.
Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, meanwhile, received Thai athletes and organizers Monday at his palace, and wished them good luck and success.
"Even though the country has faced financial trouble, Thailand has shown the watching world that the crisis cannot be an obstacle if there is sincerity and harmony among Thais to make this major event happen," he added.
China hopes to win its first Asian Games gold medal in the martial art of taekwondo next month in Thailand, the official newspaper China Sports Daily said Tuesday.
The team of six women and three men will be China's first to compete in taekwondo at the Asian Games, the report said.
China only began developing taekwondo in 1995, a year after the last Asian Games, the newspaper said.
China picked up one silver and one bronze medal at the 1997 world championships and won a gold, silver and five bronze medals at the Asian championships this year, the report said.
With South Korea, Taiwan and Iran the strongest taekwondo nations all competing in the upcoming games, "the Chinese team's goal is to go all out to win one gold medal," it said.
Head coach Chen Liren was quoted as saying that a recent decision by the sport's international federation to adjust weight categories for competitions would affect China's women.
The team would not be dominant at any weight, he said.
"Strong competitors at the Asian Games will be as numerous as trees in a forest," Chen was quoted as saying.
Meanwhile, world record holder Wu Yanyan has been swimming an average 11 kilometers (7 miles) a day at a camp in southwest China where she is in training for the games, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
But the 20 year old Wu, who shattered the 200 meter individual medley record at China's national games in October 1997, said it would be difficult for her to reach her peak at the Asian Games because she has recently had stamina problems, Xinhua added.
Star striker Chen Yang scored a hat trick Wednesday for China in a lackluster 4 1 victory over Cambodia, securing his country a spot in the second soccer round for the 13th Asian Games.
Underdog Turkmenistan also earned a second round berth by overcoming a 2 0 half time deficit to defeat South Korea in a nail biting finish, with two goals coming in the final 10 minutes.
The United Arab Emirates and North Korea ended regulation play and extra time at 3 3, settling their Group E match in the southern city of Songkhla with a penalty shootout.
The Emirates won, 7 4.
Playing at the National Stadium on a poor pitch with traces of day old repairs visible, host Thailand made a fiery debut against Hong Kong, shutting out their opponents 5 0 after leading 3 0 at the half.
Thailand's Kritsada Piandit scored the first goal barely a minute into the match, followed by teammates Worawood Srimaka on a penalty in the eighth minute and Kiatisuk Senamuang in the 22nd minute.
Eight minutes into the second half, Tawan Sripan kicked in Thailand's fourth goal, and Kiatisuk hit the target for the second time at the 40th minute to make the final score 5 0.
The result takes Hong Kong out of competition, since they also lost their Group F opener to Oman on Monday.
China fulfilled expectations of topping Group B in Surat Thani with the victory over Cambodia, the 4 1 scoreline mirroring Monday's rout of Lebanon.
But though the Chinese dominated, they failed to sparkle.
Chen scored early in the first half, heading in a long pass from midfield.
Peng Wang caught a pass on the right side about 10 minutes later and fired his second Asian Games goal.
Chen scored again on a near shot and headed in his third goal in the 38th minute.
Cambodia partially salvaged its honor late in the second half when Hok Sochetra beat the complacent Chinese defense and scored.
It was one of the only shots on goal that the Cambodians had.
Following Monday's victory over regional favorite Vietnam, Turkmenistan staged its second upset in Group A in the central city of Nakhon Sawan, eclipsing South Korea.
The South Koreans carved up the Turkmenistan defense in the first half.
Yong Soo Choi gave his team which hoped to erase memories of a dismal World Cup a commanding two goal advantage with an opening minute goal and a shot that pin balled off a teammate into the net in the 44th minute.
Turkmenistan regrouped after the half.
A long cross found the head of Igor Kislov to put Turkmenistan on the scoreboard.
Steady pressure led to a dangerous foul and red card for South Korea's Byoung Keun Lee.
Muslim Agaev took advantage of the reduced South Korean side with a slicing left footed shot into the top far corner to equalize.
Kislov fired home the winner in the dying minutes.
China's women divers expect to clinch Asian Games gold in the platform competition but could face stiff competition from Kazakstan in the springboard.
"If we make no big mistake, the gold should be ours," Chinese platform diver Li Na said Sunday, on the eve of the start to the diving competition.
The diminutive 14 year old, competing in her first major international competition, told China's state run Xinhua News Agency that she sees her 16 year old teammate Cai Yuyan as her main opponent in the platform.
But she acknowledged that Kazakstan's Irina Vyguzova could challenge China in the women's three meter springboard, Xinhua said.
"Irina is an excellent diver," said Li.
"If she gives her best in the competition, she has the chance to snatch the gold away from Chinese divers."
Guo Jingjing and Yang Lan will represent China in the women's springboard contest.
Despite catastrophic hunger at home, North Korea plans to send 317 athletes and officials to next month's Asian Games in Thailand, South Korean officials said Thursday.
It will be the largest sports delegation the communist country has sent abroad in recent years.
North Korean Sports Minister Chang Ung said 209 athletes from his country will compete in 21 events in Bangkok, hoping to win medals in women's judo, women's soccer, wrestling, table tennis, weightlifting and boxing.
Chang made the remarks in an interview published recently by the Chosun Shinbo, a newspaper run by pro North Korean residents in Japan, said Seoul's Naewoe Press, which obtained the report.
Chang said North Korea was sending a large delegation to Bangkok to prepare for the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
North Korea did not enter the last Asian Games, in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994.
It sent only 18 athletes and officials to the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, in February.
Naewoe is run by South Korea's main government intelligence agency and specializes in monitoring communist news media.
Three years of floods and drought that started in 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming and planned economy, forcing the country to rely on outside aid to feed its 23 million people.

WASHINGTON Urged on by the Clinton administration, Saudi Arabia's top intelligence official met privately with the leader of the Taliban in late September to try to persuade Afghanistan to deport Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile suspected of masterminding the August bombings of two American embassies in East Africa, according to U.S. and Arab officials.
Just weeks after the United States launched a cruise missile strike against bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, Prince Turki bin Faisal, chief of Saudi intelligence, sat down with Mullah Mohammed Omar, leader of the Taliban's Supreme Council, and asked him to end his protection for bin Laden and hand him over, Arab officials said.
The Taliban, the Islamic movement that controls most of Afghanistan, refused.
Their recalcitrance in the face of Turki's personal request finally prompted Saudi Arabia, one of the Taliban's most important financial sponsors and allies, to downgrade its diplomatic ties with the group.
American officials say they are supporting diplomatic efforts to persuade the Taliban to deport bin Laden.
"Achieving the expulsion of bin Laden and bringing him to justice is something we are actively pursuing," said a State Department official.
In their effort to persuade Afghanistan to deport bin Laden, State Department officials also have spoken to Taliban representatives themselves and have sought the intercession of Pakistan, the only other major ally of Afghanistan in the region.
They have also, said an Arab official, talked to members of bin Laden's family in Saudi Arabia.
If Afghanistan does turn over bin Laden to Saudi Arabia, it is possible that bin Laden might be tried there, rather than in the United States.
If he were to be handed over to the Saudis and brought back to Saudi Arabia, one Arab official said, he could face swift execution.
Administration officials say they want him to face trial in the United States.
They say they asked the Saudis to urge the Taliban only to deport bin Laden.
Senior U.S. officials said they were not negotiating with the Taliban, but simply repeating the message that they should get rid of bin Laden.
"We've certainly urged, in public and private, all those who have influence with the Taliban, that it is our strong view bin Laden should be expelled and brought to justice," a White House spokesman said.
"We will certainly continue our multi pronged strategy of combating bin Laden's network."
Clinton administration officials said the new diplomatic effort did not preclude further military action against bin Laden and his terrorist network.
Officials said the Aug 20 cruise missile attack was intended to break up the network and perhaps kill bin Laden.
Since then, the FBI and other law enforcement and intelligence agencies say they are continuing to work with other nations to arrest as many of bin Laden's operatives as possible.
Bin Laden already faces criminal charges in the United States under a sealed indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in New York.
Pressing the Taliban is part of a broad effort to damage the bin Laden network, officials say.
"Our tactics may have changed, but our strategy of putting him out of action remains the same," said a senior American official.
"This is another way of trying to deal with the problem."
But critics outside of government say it also suggests ambivalence among administration officials over how best to deal with the radical Islamic group that now controls most of Afghanistan.
"There has been a gap between our interests in Afghanistan and the level of our attention to the need for a strategy," said Zalmay Khalilzad, an Afghan expert at Rand Corp. "A rogue state could emerge there, so we either need to pay attention now, or later."
The Saudi role in trying to extricate bin Laden from Afghanistan has been a murky one, complicated by Islamic politics and the longstanding alliance between the Saudis and the Taliban.
But the Saudi request to the Taliban for bin Laden represents a significant shift.
Previously, the Saudis had made it clear that they did not want bin Laden brought back to Saudi Arabia, for fear that he could be a martyr figure to Saudi dissidents.
More broadly, U.S. officials say they have been frustrated by the Saudis' refusal to cooperate fully on terrorism investigations in the past, especially in the case of the 1996 bombing of the American military barracks at Khobar Towers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
But now, what administration officials say is the clear evidence of his involvement in the East African bombings, as well as a growing belief among Saudi officials that bin Laden poses a threat to their government, seems to have prompted a change in their strategy.
And, while he is not currently under indictment for any crimes in Saudi Arabia, Arab and U.S officials now say they have evidence linking him to the 1995 car bombing of a military facility in Riyadh in which American servicemen were killed.
Bin Laden, who was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 1994, would face "swift" action if he were brought back to Saudi Arabia, said one Arab official.
Now, even bin Laden's wealthy Saudi family is cooperating with the United States and Saudi Arabia on how to bring him to heel, the Arab official said.
The bin Laden family made a fortune in the construction industry.
"U.S. officials, after Saudi Arabia blessed it, have talked to members of the bin Laden family," the Arab official said.
After Taliban officials repeatedly said they would consider turning over bin Laden if they were presented with evidence against him, Arab officials familiar with the matter say that Prince Turki presented evidence to the Taliban of bin Laden's involvement in terrorism, but it made no difference.
Evidence was also presented by Bill Richardson, former chief delegate to the United Nations, when he visited Afghanistan earlier this year.
But Clinton administration officials, fearing that his return to Saudi Arabia could lead to trouble for the Saudi regime, stress they do not want the Saudis to have bin Laden brought back to their country.
And they note that the United States does not have an extradition treaty with Saudi Arabia.
The Clinton administration is still determined to have bin Laden put on trial in the United States, they said.
"We don't have a policy on whether we would accept bin Laden being brought to justice in a third country, we haven't crossed that bridge yet," one administration official said.
"But Saudi Arabia would not be the place where we would want him to go."
Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, the Taliban's ambassador designate to the United Nations, confirmed in an interview that his government's discussions with Turki over bin Laden had been "disappointing," but argued that Afghanistan's unwillingness to oust its "guest" would not damage long term relations between Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.
He added that his government would be willing to try bin Laden in Islamic court in Afghanistan if there was "solid" evidence against him.
NAIROBI, Kenya Nine months before the attack on the American Embassy here, U.S. intelligence officials received a detailed warning that Islamic radicals were plotting to blow up the building, according to Kenyan and American officials.
The warning forecast the Aug 7 bombing in several particulars, the officials said.
It came from an Egyptian man who American officials now believe was involved in the simultaneous terrorist assaults on the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
The Egyptian, Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, is now in jail in Tanzania, charged by local prosecutors with bombing the embassy there.
Since the bombings, the State Department has maintained that it received no specific warnings about threats to its embassies in East Africa.
But late on Thursday, a spokesman acknowledged that the CIA had sent the State Department two reports about Ahmed that prompted the embassy in Kenya to step up security for several weeks.
When no attack materialized, the embassy's precautions returned to normal.
No further steps were taken to improve the building's physical security.
Disclosure of the warning raises new questions about the State Department's protection of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which did not meet the department's own minimum standards for security.
Until now, department officials have insisted that the embassies faced only a minimal threat from terrorists.
In the days after the bombings, the administration acknowledged that it had spurned requests from the American ambassador in Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, to move the entire embassy to a safer location.
The State Department would not say whether her cables mentioned Ahmed's warning.
According to American officials, Ahmed walked into the Nairobi embassy last November and told American intelligence officials that he knew of a group that was planning to detonate a bomb laden truck inside the diplomats' underground parking garage.
In a separate interrogation by Kenyan intelligence officials, which was relayed to the Americans, Ahmed said he had already taken surveillance photos of the embassy for the attack, which was to involve several vehicles and stun grenades, Kenyan officials said.
Analysts at the CIA were unable to link Ahmed to any terrorist group but they nonetheless sent two reports last November about his statements to various government agencies.
The reports, American officials said, included several caveats.
The CIA said that a foreign intelligence service that cooperates with the agency believed that Ahmed was a fabricator of information.
In the reports, CIA analysts said that they could not rule out the possibility that Ahmed's threats were serious.
But they said that the threats might also be a sophisticated ploy by terrorists to observe and then counter the defenses the embassy would take against a possible attack.
After Ahmed appeared at the embassy, American officials alerted their Kenyan counterpars, who questioned the Egytian and then deported him.
Soon after, Ahmed made his way to Tanzania where, American officials now believe, he participated in the Aug 7 bombing of the embassy that left 11 people dead.
The embassy attack in Kenya unfolded that same day much as Ahmed had said it would: A team of terrorists using two vehicles attempted to drive an explosives packed truck into the parking garage.
One of the attackers tossed stun grenades to frighten off the locally hired security guards.
When an exiting car blocked their access to the garage, the attackers set off the bomb.
A Clinton administration official acknowledged that the embassy in Kenya had received a specific warning about an attack.
"It is embarrassing," this official said, quickly adding: "It is tragic."
Asked why the embassy took few steps to improve its security after the warning, he said: "That's the 64 million dollar question."
Other officials defended the government's handling of the case, noting that American intelligence is deluged with warnings about terrorist plots, most of which prove groundless.
Thus far, Tanzanian authorities have not allowed Ahmed to be interviewed, and it was unclear what motivated him to alert authorities about a plot in which he appears to have played a role.
He told the Kenyans that in the past he had provided authorities with information about Islamic radicals because he wanted to see them arrested and rehabilitated rather than caught committing a crime for which they would be executed.
Ahmed has said he is innocent of the charges and his lawyer, Abdul Mwengela, said his client's information about the bombings stemmed solely from a conversation he had overheard the previous year in a Nairobi hotel.
A Tanzanian court refused to release Ahmed on bail this week and ruled that FBI agents would be permitted to interrogate him.
Tanzanian investigators suspect he was a central figure in the plot.
They are now examining whether Ahmed drove one of the vehicles used in the Dar es Salaam bombing and whether the 400 pounds of explosives used in both blasts came into Tanzania in a shipment of rice imported by one of his companies.
The Clinton administration has not sought to extradite Ahmed from Tanzania event though federal law permits the United States to bring charges against anyone who attempts or conspires to murder Americans anywhere in the world.
American prosecutors have already brought to the United States several other people accused of complicity in the bombings or of having ties to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who American investigators have identified as the mastermind of the attacks.
The American Embassy in Dar es Salaam declined to answer any questions about Ahmed and why Washington was not seeking his extradition.
American diplomats in Tanzania, speaking on the condition of anonymity, suggested the prosecution was being left to the Tanzanians because there were no American victims.
A White House spokesman said the case was appropriately handled and that the United States had no plans to extradite Mustafa because the Tanzanians had expressed interest in trying him.
Several non American diplomats in the region speculated that the United States is allowing the Tanzanians to try Ahmed because they fear his trial in America might bring to light his dealings with American authorities and other Western intelligence services.
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania In a rare public statement about the August bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, the FBI said Friday that two vehicles had been used in the attack on the embassy here.
The FBI also indicated that it had learned the identities of new suspects in the blast here, and that they are at large.
They were in a Suzuki Samurai, one of the two vehicles identified Friday, investigators said.
Two vehicles were also used in the bombing of the embassy in Nairobi, according to indictments that have been handed down.
One carried the bomb, the other guided the first vehicle through the streets of Nairobi to the embassy.
Investigators are pursuing the theory that the modus operandi was the same here.
One of the vehicles used in the blast here was an Atlas refrigeration truck made by Nissan, with a silver colored cargo box and white or beige cab, the FBI and the Tanzania Criminal Investigation Division said at a news conference Friday afternoon.
This was the vehicle that investigators now believe carried the bomb, which killed 11 people and wounded at least 86.
The driver of the vehicle, who has not been identified, died in the attack, according to investigators.
The simultaneous blast in Nairobi killed more than 250, including 12 Americans.
Three people have been indicted in New York in connection with the attacks, which the Clinton administration has charged were masterminded by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who lives in Afghanistan.
Friday's development should put to rest earlier reports that a water tanker, which regularly delivered water to the embassy here, had carried the bomb, an investigator said.
The refrigeration truck followed the water tanker into the compound, according to a U.S. security official.
It is not known how the refrigeration truck, a 1987 Nissan, penetrated the embassy compound here without being adequately searched.
At Friday's news conference, FBI Agent Ken Maxwell read a brief statement and declined to take any questions.
The head of Tanzania's Criminal Investigation Division, Adadi Rajabu, read a similar statement in Swahili, and also declined to take questions.
The second vehicle was a Suzuki Samurai, a small jeep popular in East Africa.
It had been "utilized by suspects thus far identified," Maxwell said.
He did not say how it had been used or who the suspects were.
Tanzania has charged two men in connection with the bombing, Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Rashid Saleh Hemed.
For reasons that are not clear, the Clinton administration has not sought to extradite either of these men, even though it has brought other suspects back to the United States, where they have been indicted.
A diplomat here said the United States did not consider the evidence against Ahmed to be very strong.
Since the bombings, the FBI and their counterparts here and in Kenya have made few public statements.
Friday's news conference was for the purpose of issuing an appeal to the Tanzanian public to come forth with any information about the vehicles, an indication that while the investigators feel they have made "a significant amount of progress," as Maxwell said Friday, they are also stymied.
NEW YORK A federal grand jury in Manhattan returned a 238 count indictment Wednesday charging the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden with conspiring to bomb two U.S. embassies in Africa in August and with committing acts of terrorism against Americans abroad.
Government officials immediately announced that they were offering two rewards of $5 million each for information leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and another man charged Wednesday, Muhammad Atef, who was described as bin Laden's chief military commander.
Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement that rules that country.
Atef's whereabouts are unknown.
Prosecutors also unsealed an earlier indictment, issued in June, that included similar but less detailed charges against bin Laden.
That indictment was returned before the embassy bombings and was the result of a two year investigation into his activities in Somalia and Saudi Arabia, as well as reports that he had connections to a circle of Islamic militants in Brooklyn.
The new indictment, which supersedes the June action, accused bin Laden of leading a vast terrorist conspiracy from 1989 to the present, in which he was said to be working in concert with governments, including those of Sudan, Iraq and Iran, and terrorist groups, to build weapons and attack American military installations.
But the indictment gives few details of bin Laden's alleged involvement in the embassy attacks.
The indictment does not, for example, specify whether prosecutors have evidence that bin Laden gave direct orders to those who carried out the attacks.
Nothing in the document indicates why the original indictment was kept secret for months, but the secret charges were returned about the time that American officials were plotting a possible raid into Afghanistan to arrest bin Laden.
Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said, "It's very common to have sealed indictments when you're trying to apprehend those who are indicted."
Both indictments offer new information about bin Laden's operations, including one deal he is said to have struck with Iraq to cooperate in the development of weapons in return for bin Laden's agreeing not to work against that country.
No details were given about whether the alleged deal with Iraq led to the development of actual weapons for bin Laden's group, which is called Al Qaeda.
The government said Wednesday that bin Laden's group had used private relief groups "as conduits for transmitting funds" for Al Qaeda.
The groups were not identified.
Prosecutors also said bin Laden's group had conducted internal investigations of its members and their associates, trying to detect who might be acting as informants, and had killed those who had been suspected of collaborating with "enemies of the organization."
The government indicated earlier that its knowledge of bin Laden's activities stemmed in part from the cooperation of one such informant, who it said Wednesday had worked for bin Laden, transporting weapons and explosives, helping to buy land for his training camps and assisting in running his finances.
While the June indictment against bin Laden suggested that the government had a great deal of knowledge of his dealings in the months before the embassy attacks, the new charges are an indication of how quickly the government has worked to solve the embassy attacks, which occurred just three months ago.
Ms White said bin Laden was charged with "plotting and carrying out the most heinous acts of international terrorism and murder."
Citing the more than 250 people killed in the embassy attacks and the more than 1000 wounded, she added, "In a greater sense, all of the citizens of the world are also victims whenever and wherever the cruel and cowardly acts of international terrorism strike."
The investigation of bin Laden is continuing, said Ms White and Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant director of the FBI in New York, whose agents have fanned out around the world to look into the embassy attacks.
"Our investigative strategy is clear," Schiliro said.
"We will identify, locate and prosecute all those responsible, right up the line, from those who constructed and delivered the bombs to those who paid for them and ordered it done."
NEW YORK Several months after the bombing of the World Trade Center in February 1993, one of the suspects tried to bargain with federal prosecutors in New York, offering inside information about the bomb plot in exchange for a lighter sentence.
The deal never materialized, and the defendant was eventually found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.
But the details he offered in that secret meeting about his Brooklyn based circle of Arab militants are resonating today in another terrorism case.
The accused bomber told prosecutors that he had twice turned to a Texas acquaintance named Wadih el Hage to buy weapons for his Brooklyn associates.
Last month, el Hage was arrested on charges of being part of the Osama bin Laden terror network that is suspected of the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug 7) It is not clear how federal investigators followed up the tip about el Hage that they received in 1993.
But after the embassy bombings, it is evident that they are ascribing new significance to el Hage's contacts with the Brooklyn militants who figured not only in the World Trade Center case, but also in the assassination of Rabbi Meir Kahane in 1990 and a conspiracy to blow up the United Nations and other New York landmarks in 1993.
Indeed, the government recently asserted for the first time that the roots of bin Laden's organization could be traced, in part, to a sparsely furnished office on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn that was called Alkifah Refugee Center and had for many years been a gathering place for that same fringe group of terrorists.
Prosecutors have not said what role, if any, bin Laden is supposed to have played in the activities of Alkifah Center.
Nor have they said how the center, which has been closed for about five years, relates to his global campaign to attack Americans overseas.
But in the government's version so far, bin Laden's far flung network is presented as a tapestry of personal relationships between men of different nationalities and backgrounds who share his determination to rid the Islamic world of American influence.
In the United States, prosecutors now suggest, such relationships evolved from Alkifah Refugee Center.
In the mid 1980s the strip of Arab restaurants and Islamic bookstores on Atlantic Avenue, between Third and Fourth streets, was the first port of call for many immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa.
Notices posted in the shops advertised jobs, rooms for rent and religious activities for Arabic speaking newcomers.
Alkifah Center, in those years, was a neighborhood hub.
It started out as a desk in Al Farooq Mosque around 1986 and then moved into a small apartment in a building a few doors away at 566 Atlantic Ave., above what is now a perfume factory, with just enough room for a desk, a few chairs, a phone and a fax machine.
The center's stated purpose was to raise money and recruit fighters to help the U.S. backed Afghan mujahedeen, who rebelled against the Communist government in Afghanistan after an invasion by the Soviet Union in 1979.
People in the neighborhood who remember Alkifah Center say it appeared to be a shoestring operation, although court papers suggest that tens of thousands of dollars flowed through its bank accounts in its heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It was this ramshackle office that the government says evolved into the American outpost of bin Laden's international terrorist organization.
The center was set up by Mustafa Shalabi, an Egyptian immigrant.
As his former neighbors recall him, Shalabi was infused with the same religious fervor for the Afghan cause that galvanized many young Muslims who regarded it as a holy war to liberate a Muslim country from Communist domination.
One of those who answered the call to fight in Afghanistan was Mahmud Abouhalima, who was active in militant Islamic movements in his native Egypt before moving to West Germany in 1981 and to New York four years later.
Abouhalima would later become a well known figure in New York as one of the men accused in the World Trade Center bombing.
Shortly after his arrest in that case, he met with government investigators without his lawyer and provided a detailed account of Alkifah Refugee Center and its internecine rivalries.
He recounted his brief stint with the mujahedeen in Afghanistan and told of traveling with a Palestinian man he knew as Mohammed Odeh to Peshawar, in northern Pakistan, the staging area for the Afghan rebels.
Abouhalima said they had spent two and a half months in separate training camps, learning how to use AK 47 assault rifles and rocket propelled grenade launchers.
Later, they joined a militia unit and fought against Soviet forces with the American financed mujahedeen.
For reasons that remain unclear, prosecutors rebuffed Abouhalima's offer of cooperation.
But his mention of Odeh is intriguing in light of more recent events.
A Palestinian man with a similar name and background, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, has been charged with driving the truck that delivered the bomb in the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi.
He has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial in New York.
Federal officials declined to say whether the Odeh charged in the embassy attack this year is the same Palestinian whose name surfaced five years ago.
In his 1993 statement to investigators, Abouhalima made no mention of bin Laden, although bin Laden is known to have worked in Afghanistan and Pakistan during the war years distributing official Saudi aid money for the mujahedeen.
Not long after Abouhalima returned to New York in late 1988, the Afghan war began to wind down.
The Soviet Union withdrew the last of its troops in 1989.
Two years later, the United States agreed to stop supplying arms to fractious Afghan warlords, and Afghanistan descended into civil war.
Many of the Arab men who had gone to fight, including bin Laden, stayed on but turned their religious fury against secular Arab governments and, ultimately, the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf and in Africa.
The turmoil in postwar Afghanistan echoed in Brooklyn, where Shalabi kept Alkifah Center open.
With the arrival in Brooklyn in 1990 of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric who was later convicted of conspiring to blow up New York landmarks, Abouhalima said, the regulars at Alkifah began to quarrel over money, political direction and leadership.
It was around that time that Abouhalima said he had first met el Hage, a Lebanese born naturalized American citizen, at an Islamic conference in Oklahoma City.
Just how close the two men became is not clear.
Abouhalima's lawyer in his World Trade Center trial, Hassen Ibn Abdellah, said, "That case is over, and I know nothing of the government's information or their sources."
But el Hage was familiar with several of the Arab immigrants associated with Alkifah Center, say prosecutors and the account that Abouhalima provided investigators.
A federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, said in court last month, for example, that el Hage had a relationship with El Sayyid A ) Nosair, the Egyptian immigrant convicted on federal charges in slaying of Kahane.
He did not elaborate.
Abouhalima, who told investigators that he had been in charge of protecting Sheik Abdel Rahman during the cleric's stay in the United States, told investigators that he had gone at least twice to el Hage to buy guns.
Abouhalima said he obtained a 9 millimeter handgun from el Hage in 1990 for use by the cleric's bodyguards.
Abouhalima also told investigators that he later gave el Hage $4000 to buy handguns and AK 47s to defend his associates from the Jewish Defense League in New York, an organization founded by Kahane.
Abouhalima said el Hage had been unable to obtain the weapons and returned most of the money.
The timing of the transaction was not made clear.
The government cited the weapons transaction in a court hearing last month to persuade a federal magistrate to deny bail to el Hage.
Fitzgerald, the prosecutor, said el Hage had acknowledged dealings with Abouhalima.
"The defendant has admitted that while in Texas he made efforts to obtain firearms for Mahmud Abouhalima," Fitzgerald said.
"His claim is that after purchasing the firearms, Mr Abouhalima failed to pick them up."
Abouhalima told investigators of other contacts with el Hage.
He said that el Hage called him from Texas in early 1991 and said Shalabi wanted him to come to New York to help resolve a conflict within Alkifah Center.
At the time, Shalabi's leadership was under fire from dissidents within his circle, including Abouhalima.
El Hage did come to New York.
A short time later, Shalabi was found slain in his Brooklyn apartment.
No one has been charged, and the crime remains unsolved.
Abouhalima said he and el Hage had met one more time in Al Farooq Mosque on Atlantic Avenue, a few doors from Alkifah Center.
The topic of discussion, he said, was Shalabi's troubles and his recent killing.
Prosecutors say that by 1994, el Hage moved his wife and children to Sudan, where neighbors said they knew him as the director of Africa Help, a private aid organization.
But the government said he was the private secretary to bin Laden, who by then had relocated from Afghanistan to Sudan.
Later that year, the government said, el Hage moved to Kenya, where he shared a house for a time with a man named Haroun Fazil and helped bin Laden set up some of his front companies in Africa.
Fazil is accused of playing a role in the August embassy bombings in Africa.
The government appears to have been tracking el Hage for at least a year before the embassy bombings.
In September of last year, he was pointedly questioned by federal agents investigating bin Laden's group.
El Hage, who moved back to the United States in 1997, has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to kill Americans and of lying to federal agents.
In court his lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, denied that his client had any connection to terrorist activities.
McIntyre could not be reached for further comment.
These days, Arab immigrants still congregate along the little strip of shops on Atlantic Avenue, where Arab food and novelties are sold alongside Islamic books.
A few thousand pray at Al Farooq Mosque at the main Friday prayers, but it no longer has a reputation as a hotbed of radical Islamic activity.
Most of the men who were drawn to Alkifah Center in its turbulent days have melted quietly back into their communities, say people in the neighborhood familiar with the center's history.
"In 1994 this mosque finally settled down," said Abdulhakim Ali Mohamed, the American born religious scholar who became the imam, or leader, of the mosque three years ago.
No one is permitted to misuse the mosque to preach politics or hate, he added.
"If there's anything to say," Mohamed said, "I'll say it."
German police raided several locations near Bonn after receiving word of a terrorist threat against the U.S. Embassy, but no evidence of a planned attack was found, officials said Wednesday.
Police, including agents of an elite anti terrorist unit, checked several suspects during raids in an industrial zone and other sites Tuesday, but no arrests were made, said Eva Schuebel, spokeswoman for the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe.
The agency said it had received "credible information" that Middle East terrorists had stockpiled arms and explosives at the sites, but none were found.
The agency's investigation is continuing, Schuebel said.
"For now, we can no longer speak of an immediate threat to the U.S. Embassy," she said.
The embassy had no comment.
Security was tightened at U.S. installations worldwide after the Aug 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
Saudi dissident Osama Bin Laden is wanted by U.S. officials for those attacks.
A suspected top aide of bin Laden, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, is jailed in Germany pending a U.S. extradition request, raising concern about reprisals on German soil.
U.S. authorities charge Salim helped finance, train and arm members of a terrorist organization, including the alleged bombers of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
In September, German police stepped up security at the U.S. consulate in Hamburg after receiving a tip about a possible threat.
An Islamic militant group on Thursday threatened to retaliate if Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden is arrested, and described Washington's No. 1 enemy as a "hero" to Muslims worldwide.
Bin Laden, believed to be in Afghanistan, and a top aide were indicted Wednesday by a U.S. District Court in the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa and are accused of conspiring to kill Americans outside the United States.
The State Department also announced a reward of up to dlrs 5 million for bin Laden's capture.
"It is a challenge to the entire Muslim world ,Bin Laden is a hero of the Muslim world," said Omar Warsi, a leader of Pakistan's militant Sunni Muslim group, Sipah e Sahaba, or Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet.
"If anything happens to him, America will be responsible."
Many Sipah e Sahaba followers are fighting in neighboring Afghanistan alongside the Taliban army, which rules 90 percent of Afghanistan and has imposed a strict version of Islamic law in those areas.
Warsi's group is well armed with everything from machine guns to rocket launchers.
In Pakistan, it has been blamed in killings of hundreds of Shiite Muslims, whom the group reviles as non Muslims based on a centuries old dispute over who was the proper successor to the Prophet Mohammed.
Harakat ul Ansar, a Pakistan based organization labeled a terrorist group by the United States, said, however, that foreigners in Pakistan "have nothing to fear from us."
Harakat is considered a strong supporter of bin Laden, and several Harakat followers were killed in the U.S. missile attack on alleged bin Laden terror sites in Afghanistan.
"What the United States does is their business," said Abdul Bassit, a Harakat follower.
He added, however, that the United States should know bin Laden "is a good Muslim, and all the Muslim world thinks he is a good Muslim."
The Taliban say bin Laden is a respected guest who will not be extradited.
However, they have set up a judicial inquiry to accept evidence of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activity and have promised to prosecute him if the evidence warrants it.
Washington blames bin Laden's group, al Qaeda, for the Aug 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injured an estimated 5000 people.
The United States retaliated Aug 20, firing Tomahawk cruise missiles at suspected bin Laden training camps in eastern Afghanistan.
At least 26 people were killed, but damage to the area was not considered extensive.
The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan evacuated nonessential staff and family members prior to the August bombing of Afghanistan, fearing retaliation.
While some embassy workers are back, their dependents and about 30 percent of the staff have not been allowed to return.
Embassy officials said no fresh security warnings followed Wednesday's indictment.
Security measures already in place include cement barricades blocking the road leading to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad and razor sharp barbed wire topping the brick walled compound.
In the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, on the border with Afghanistan, the U.S. consulate is surrounded by barbed wire and protected by an armored personnel carrier and dozens of armed police.
NEW YORK A federal district judge agreed Tuesday to review complaints by lawyers for three men arrested after the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa that their jail conditions in Manhattan are unconstitutional and inhumane.
Judge Leonard Sand of U.S. District Court in Manhattan said he had received an eight page letter from lawyers for two of three defendants in custody in Manhattan.
The lawyers complained that their clients were being held in total isolation for almost 24 hours a day in a unit called 10 South, the most restrictive holding area in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan.
The defendants are allowed only brief periods of exercise in a barren room, called the rat cage, a defense lawyer, Michael Young, wrote in the letter.
A second lawyer, Leonard Joy, concurred with the views in the letter, which was made public Tuesday.
In agreeing to review the conditions, Sand said, "Certainly it has to be addressed, that is, the condition of confinement for all of the defendants."
The judge made his comments in the first hearing in the bombing case since last week's indictment by a federal grand jury of Osama bin Laden, who the authorities believe was the mastermind of the embassy attacks.
Bin Laden remains at large and is believed to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement that rules that country.
In discussing conditions at the Manhattan jail, the lawyers said that two of the defendants have not been able to call their families, while the third has been allowed to make only one phone call.
The lawyers added that the defendants cannot have visitors, write letters, or receive mail or books.
The skirmishing continued in court.
"I cannot give my client a dictionary," a third lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, who represents Wadih el Hage, told the judge.
El Hage has been charged with conspiring to kill Americans abroad and has been described by the government as a former personal secretary to bin Laden.
The two other defendants in court Tuesday Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al 'Owhali have each been charged with separate counts of murder in the deaths of more than 200 people in the embassy attacks in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7.
All three men have pleaded not guilty.
Patrick Fitzgerald, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the judge that the government would have a response by Friday, and his comments suggested that the government will be prepared to make some modifications in the restrictions.
NEW YORK Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Wednesday that one of the men accused of conspiring to bomb the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August had met earlier with Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the attacks, and "asked him for a mission."
The reported meeting between bin Laden and the accused man, Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al'Owhali, which had not previously been described, is the strongest allegation offered so far to link bin Laden to the attacks, in which more than 250 people died.
The meeting, which prosecutors said took place in 1996, is reported in a new 48 page indictment of Al 'Owhali and three others that a federal grand jury in Manhattan returned Wednesday.
It shows how prosecutors are continuing to build the circumstantial case that bin Laden, a Saudi businessman in exile, was behind the embassy bombings and other attacks against Americans stationed abroad in the 1990s.
The prosecutors did not indicate bin Laden's response to the offer, he is not charged in the new indictment.
The indictment does not indicate whether prosecutors have any evidence that bin Laden directly ordered the bombings, or whether they may argue that he inspired a group of followers to carry out the attacks.
Bin Ladin has called for attacks on U.S. and other Western interests.
Nonetheless, in issuing the new charges against men suspected of being bin Laden's associates, the government also declared more concretely than previously that bin Laden has been a major backer of terrorism groups worldwide.
Its list of terrorist groups includes Al Jihad in Egypt and the Islamic Group, which is led by Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who was convicted in 1996 in the plot to blow up landmarks in New York City.
The indictment asserted that bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda, worked on its own and through Al Jihad, Islamic Group and others, which "operated under its umbrella."
The authorities also gave their first account of what they called bin Laden's network of businesses and front companies in Sudan that he allegedly used to raise money to support terrorism and to provide cover for the acquisition of explosives, weapons and chemicals, and the travel of his associates.
CAIRO The Taliban movement in Afghanistan might consider putting Osama bin Laden on trial for a 1996 bomb attack that killed 19 American airmen in Saudi Arabia, a leading Saudi owned newspaper reported Wednesday.
Bin Laden, the Saudi born Islamic militant who lives in Afghanistan, has long been suspected of involvement in that and other attacks on Americans, including the Aug 7 bombings of two U.S. Embassies in Africa.
He has been indicted in the United States, charged with terrorist acts committed before the embassy bombings.
But efforts to bring bin Laden to justice have been hamstrung by the fact that the Taliban, which control most of Afghanistan, is a militant Islamic movement whose leaders who have said they will not hand him over to the United States or to anyone else.
The report, in the London based newspaper Al Hayat, that the Taliban might consider trying bin Laden themselves could not be independently confirmed.
A senior Taliban diplomat reached by telephone in Pakistan dismissed it as "baseless."
But Al Hayat is generally a reliable source on matters involving the Saudi government, and it reported that the Taliban had communicated the offer to Saudi Arabia as a good will gesture.
If it is true, the report would suggest that the Taliban might at least be reconsidering their position on bin Laden, which has deeply complicated its relations with the West and with Saudi Arabia, one of only three countries in the world to recognize the militant movement as Afghanistan's legitimate government.
Saudi Arabia has never charged bin Laden or anyone else in the 1996 bombing, and any specific American accusations linking bin Laden to that attack have been spelled out only in a sealed indictment.
But U.S. officials have said they have learned enough about the bombing, of an American military compound in the eastern Saudi city of Dhahran, to regard bin Laden as a prime suspect.
Saudi Arabia, which stripped bin Laden of his citizenship in 1994 because of his militant activities, has turned up pressure against Afghanistan in a clear show of protest at the sanctuary provided there to him.
Last month, it expelled the Afghan charge d'affaires and recalled its own top envoy from Kabul, the Afghan capital, saying that the moves were "in keeping with national interest."
WASHINGTON Urged on by the Clinton administration, Saudi Arabia's top intelligence official met privately with the leader of the Taliban in late September to try to persuade Afghanistan to deport Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile suspected of masterminding the August bombings of two American embassies in East Africa, according to U.S. and Arab officials.
Just weeks after the United States launched a cruise missile strike against bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, Prince Turki bin Faisal, chief of Saudi intelligence, sat down with Mullah Mohammed Omar, leader of the Taliban's Supreme Council, and asked him to end his protection for bin Laden and hand him over, Arab officials said.
The Taliban, the Islamic movement that controls most of Afghanistan, refused.
Their recalcitrance in the face of Turki's personal request finally prompted Saudi Arabia, one of the Taliban's most important financial sponsors and allies, to downgrade its diplomatic ties with the group.
American officials say they are supporting diplomatic efforts to persuade the Taliban to deport bin Laden.
"Achieving the expulsion of bin Laden and bringing him to justice is something we are actively pursuing," said a State Department official.
In their effort to persuade Afghanistan to deport bin Laden, State Department officials also have spoken to Taliban representatives themselves and have sought the intercession of Pakistan, the only other major ally of Afghanistan in the region.
They have also, said an Arab official, talked to members of bin Laden's family in Saudi Arabia.
If Afghanistan does turn over bin Laden to Saudi Arabia, it is possible that bin Laden might be tried there, rather than in the United States.
If he were to be handed over to the Saudis and brought back to Saudi Arabia, one Arab official said, he could face swift execution.
Administration officials say they want him to face trial in the United States.
They say they asked the Saudis to urge the Taliban only to deport bin Laden.
Senior U.S. officials said they were not negotiating with the Taliban, but simply repeating the message that they should get rid of bin Laden.
"We've certainly urged, in public and private, all those who have influence with the Taliban, that it is our strong view bin Laden should be expelled and brought to justice," a White House spokesman said.
"We will certainly continue our multi pronged strategy of combating bin Laden's network."
Clinton administration officials said the new diplomatic effort did not preclude further military action against bin Laden and his terrorist network.
Officials said the Aug 20 cruise missile attack was intended to break up the network and perhaps kill bin Laden.
Since then, the FBI and other law enforcement and intelligence agencies say they are continuing to work with other nations to arrest as many of bin Laden's operatives as possible.
Bin Laden already faces criminal charges in the United States under a sealed indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in New York.
Pressing the Taliban is part of a broad effort to damage the bin Laden network, officials say.
"Our tactics may have changed, but our strategy of putting him out of action remains the same," said a senior American official.
"This is another way of trying to deal with the problem."
But critics outside of government say it also suggests ambivalence among administration officials over how best to deal with the radical Islamic group that now controls most of Afghanistan.
"There has been a gap between our interests in Afghanistan and the level of our attention to the need for a strategy," said Zalmay Khalilzad, an Afghan expert at Rand Corp. "A rogue state could emerge there, so we either need to pay attention now, or later."
The Saudi role in trying to extricate bin Laden from Afghanistan has been a murky one, complicated by Islamic politics and the longstanding alliance between the Saudis and the Taliban.
But the Saudi request to the Taliban for bin Laden represents a significant shift.
Previously, the Saudis had made it clear that they did not want bin Laden brought back to Saudi Arabia, for fear that he could be a martyr figure to Saudi dissidents.
More broadly, U.S. officials say they have been frustrated by the Saudis' refusal to cooperate fully on terrorism investigations in the past, especially in the case of the 1996 bombing of the American military barracks at Khobar Towers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
But now, what administration officials say is the clear evidence of his involvement in the East African bombings, as well as a growing belief among Saudi officials that bin Laden poses a threat to their government, seems to have prompted a change in their strategy.
And, while he is not currently under indictment for any crimes in Saudi Arabia, Arab and U.S officials now say they have evidence linking him to the 1995 car bombing of a military facility in Riyadh in which American servicemen were killed.
Bin Laden, who was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 1994, would face "swift" action if he were brought back to Saudi Arabia, said one Arab official.
Now, even bin Laden's wealthy Saudi family is cooperating with the United States and Saudi Arabia on how to bring him to heel, the Arab official said.
The bin Laden family made a fortune in the construction industry.
"U.S. officials, after Saudi Arabia blessed it, have talked to members of the bin Laden family," the Arab official said.
After Taliban officials repeatedly said they would consider turning over bin Laden if they were presented with evidence against him, Arab officials familiar with the matter say that Prince Turki presented evidence to the Taliban of bin Laden's involvement in terrorism, but it made no difference.
Evidence was also presented by Bill Richardson, former chief delegate to the United Nations, when he visited Afghanistan earlier this year.
But Clinton administration officials, fearing that his return to Saudi Arabia could lead to trouble for the Saudi regime, stress they do not want the Saudis to have bin Laden brought back to their country.
And they note that the United States does not have an extradition treaty with Saudi Arabia.
The Clinton administration is still determined to have bin Laden put on trial in the United States, they said.
"We don't have a policy on whether we would accept bin Laden being brought to justice in a third country, we haven't crossed that bridge yet," one administration official said.
"But Saudi Arabia would not be the place where we would want him to go."
Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, the Taliban's ambassador designate to the United Nations, confirmed in an interview that his government's discussions with Turki over bin Laden had been "disappointing," but argued that Afghanistan's unwillingness to oust its "guest" would not damage long term relations between Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.
He added that his government would be willing to try bin Laden in Islamic court in Afghanistan if there was "solid" evidence against him.
MORONI, Comoros The man accused of directing the bomb attack on the American Embassy in Kenya came of age in this impoverished Indian Ocean archipelago, a land where gifted teen agers leave home to enroll in the radical Islamic academies of Libya, Sudan and Pakistan.
A tightly wound, brilliant student of the Koran who was thrown out of religious school for caning a lazy pupil hard enough to draw blood, Abdallah Mohammed Fazul set out for Pakistan 11 years ago, at age 15, to continue his education.
Sometime over the next few years, American authorities assert, he fell under the sway of terrorists waging what they call a holy war against the United States.
He was transformed into a killer who could coolly execute a bombing that left 250 people dead.
He is still at large after being indicted in the United States under an alias, Haroun Fazil, which he apparently used in Kenya.
As the object of a worldwide manhunt, he has a $2 million reward on his head.
The stark portrait of him as a terrorist baffles his wife, his Koran teacher and relatives in Comoros, a country with a relatively liberal Muslim character.
Even relatives who admit that he had a darker side say his religious fervor seemed limited to mundane things like animosity to television and threats to chase family members into the street if he caught them drinking beer.
Nearly two months after the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, a picture of those charged in the case is slowly emerging.
They lived in different countries, labored in various professions but shared a devotion to radical Islam and a striking ability to keep family and friends in the dark about what American prosecutors say were their true activities.
Comoran officials express embarrassment that Fazil has turned the world's eyes on them.
But they say he is a true product of the forces that shaped his tropical nation poverty, Islam, racism and French colonialism.
He is one of thousands of young Comorans who have been forced by the lack of higher education to leave these strange and beautiful islands, where the world's largest volcanic crater meets startling aquamarine waves, where huge bats flit between the palm trees by day and the moon glows vividly at night, especially during power blackouts.
They study far away, in harsh desert lands where the path to holy martyrdom and the path to a bit of cash for a suffering family back home are the same: Join the legions of the Islamic Jihad.
The indictments filed so far suggest that Fazil was no ordinary legionnaire, but a highly intelligent, natural leader who played a central role in the bomb plot.
His wife's extended family lives in a yellow cinder block building behind a one room Islamic school on an alley paved only with sharp pumice.
They graciously welcomed two journalists into their threadbare rooms, offered coffee and talked for three hours.
His wife, a first cousin who married him five years ago and lived with him in Sudan and Kenya, called him a hard working computer student and said he sometimes disappeared for weeks at a time.
His big brother said he had been a gentle, sometimes boastful child who could "smurf dance like Michael Jackson" and never said anything about hating America.
When pressed, those who knew him said in so many words that they did not know him very well.
His siblings did not see him for years at a time, his wife does not expect a message even though he has been gone more than a month, and his old teachers say he never visited.
Each said, "He has no friends I know of."
According to the FBI, Fazil headed the Kenya cell of Al Qaeda, the terror network founded by Osama bin Laden, an exiled Saudi businessman.
It says Fazil rented the room where the bomb was assembled and drove the white pickup that guided it to the embassy.
On Aug 14, a week after the Nairobi blast, he flew here.
He visited relatives and his local mosque.
On Aug 22, Fazil took a flight to Dubai.
He had a ticket onward to Pakistan, but it went unused, and he disappeared.
His family says he left without explaining, as was his custom, and they drove him to the airport.
Tipped off by Nairobi telephone records that showed calls to a Moroni number, investigators descended on the family home on Sept 2) The Comoran gendarmes were accompanied by FBI agents with pistols and radio headsets, "just like Delta Force" said an uncle.
They took his brother, Omar, as well as his wife, Halima Badroudine Fazul, 22, and sister in law, Nabatte Fazul, 19, in for questioning.
They also seized two computers, diskettes, a camera, CDs and tapes, old letters, passports and birth certificates, two Korans, piles of old Newsweek and Time magazines and Kenyan newspapers, rubber stamps, most of the clothing of the family's men and some belonging to women and children.
The day of the search ended badly.
"The FBI behaved correctly they were not threatening," said Halima Fazul.
"But the Comoran gendarmes tipped my father out of bed to search it, even though he had a catheter in him."
They banged on the ceiling over his bed with their gun butts, she said.
On her way back from the police station that evening, she was told that her father, who had been suffering from a bleeding ulcer, was collapsing.
She ran, stumbling in the dark.
"He took my hand and said, 'Ah, Halima, you're back," and died, she said.
When asked about that later, a prosecutor and a ranking gendarme both shrugged, saying they were unaware that the older man had heart trouble.
No complete listing of the evidence against Fazil has been issued some may still be being tested by the FBI but threads can be pieced together from interviews.
Fazil had passports or ID documents from countries that he is not a citizen of, apparently including Kenya and France, and stamps for forging others.
The Kenyan newspapers he had kept were mostly about the bombing, an investigator said.
There was a list of prominent Comorans who would have to be killed to make way for fundamentalist rule.
Investigators also found a letter he wrote in 1991, when he was 19, to his brother Omar, then 24, in which he boasted that he had been trained to use explosives and fire machine guns.
Asked his reaction, Omar Fazul, an English teacher, said: "I was impressed but I considered it childish.
I thought he was boasting.
I didn't believe him."
Omar Fazul said he never discussed religion, politics or military service with his brother.
"We talk only about family problems," he said.
"It has never been proved to me that my brother is an Islamist.
He wears jeans and boots."
Fazil was born in 1973, the youngest of six, just before his parents separated.
He began Koranic studies at 4 with an uncle and at 7 began studying with a professional teacher, Fundi Twawilou Abdulfateh.
By the age of 9, he knew the Koran by heart and was giving religious instructions on the radio.
He was so smart, another relative said, that he was in third grade while his older sister was in first.
He played soccer and the flute and could do a standing flip.
As a teen ager, he showed off with kung fu fighting sticks and called himself James Bond.
He also had moments of rage.
He got into a fistfight with a teacher at his French public school, and slammed younger students down in their chairs when they failed at Koran recital.
"He sometimes had a strange attitude," Fundi Twawilou said.
"On the soccer field, he would provoke fights with bigger guys.
When that guy would go to beat him, he would run away.
So Omar, his brother, would be beaten.
But Omar has crippled feet, so Abdallah would return to fight for him."
At age 11, he cut another pupil's ear.
Asked to leave, he studied for two years with Fundi Mohammed Ali, an older teacher, who remembers him as "brilliant, respectful to others, deeply religious and very calm."
At 14, he switched to a school run by Fundi Soidiki Mbapandza, one of the leading Islamic fundamentalists here, before leaving for Pakistan.
Outside the tin walls of that school compound, girls and young women enter through one door, carefully avoiding eye contact with the opposite sex, while male students glower aggressively at visitors.
Fundi Soidiki, who was questioned by the police, declined several requests for an interview.
The most militant strains of fundamentalism are almost unknown in Comoros.
The islands are 99 percent Sunni Muslim, and many men wear ankle length shirts and Arab style caps, while almost all women wrap scarves around their bodies, legs and heads.
But the atmosphere is relaxed the scarves often merely adorn Western dresses and few women hide their faces or hair.
Speaking of Fazil, Justice Minister Mohammed Abdou Mmadi said, "Mr Fazul learned a different culture abroad.
It would be impossible for a Comoran who grew up here to become a terrorist."
The islands are very poor, with a gross domestic product of $470 per person.
Tourists mostly divers are few, and 80 percent of the local people are subsistence farmers and fishermen.
Because scholarships to France have dried up, many accept the meager ones offered by religious colleges in Pakistan, Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they are recruited by fundamentalists.
"There are thousands of Haroun Fazils all over the world, recruited into the foreign legion of Libya and the armies of Iran," warned Said Hilali Moussa, chief of President Abdoulkarim Taki's cabinet.
Many families get only one letter from their departed sons, said a tourism official.
It says they are safe, living in a hostel.
"Then they don't hear from them for years, and they they find out they are in the army.
Lots end up fighting in Afghanistan."
Something like that happened to Fazil.
"When he came back from Pakistan," a relative said, "he told his mother he wanted to go into the army.
She told him, 'It is up to you."
After that he became more of a mystery.
He was trained, presumably in Afghanistan, and has lived in Sudan, Kenya and perhaps in Yemen.
He comes home only for short visits, never leaves an address and calls from pay phones.
Five years ago, on a brief visit, he went with his father to Moheli Island to meet his uncle for the first time.
His cousins Halima, 17, and Nabatte, 14, were there.
"We were eating, and not well dressed, so we were embarrassed," Halima Fazul recalled.
"We ran inside to change."
At the end of the day, he had his father ask for her hand.
Mrs Fazul used to go fully veiled, with only her eyes showing, relatives said, and neighbors in Kenya said the same thing.
But when she went out visiting in Comoros, she wore her scarf off her face and was unfazed when her young son pulled it off in front of male visitors.
Her husband used to wear the traditional long shirts but now wears trousers and sometimes a suit.
When teased about the Western dress by his father, a relative said, he pointed at his heart and replied: "Proving you fear God is not in your clothes.
It's in here."
He now has money, relatives said.
He sends some home, and last year paid half the cost for his mother to go to Paris for cancer treatment.
His wife cannot identify his boss or say exactly what he does, except work on computers.
"He goes away at 8 and comes back at 6," she said.
"I don't know what he does outside."
She denied having heard of bin Laden before the blast and protested that her husband did not hate Americans.
She also gave him an alibi, saying that at 10:30 a.m. on Aug 7, when the bomb went off, he was with her at the Nairobi airport trying to get her sick father on a plane home.
There have been accusations that a fundamentalist clique within the Comoros government might shelter terrorists.
Critics note that the "hit list" for local politicians found in Fazil's house called for killing President Taki's political opponents, but not him.
And local journalists were surprised to hear that Fazil got to the airport late but boarded the plane in only 15 minutes, as if someone had cleared his way.
Moussa, the president's top adviser, called the accusations ridiculous and said they emanated from political rivals and separatists.
The government, he said, first heard from the FBI on Aug 29, a week after Fazil's departure.
Fundi Twawilou said he still felt like a father to Fazil and did not believe him guilty.
"Abdallah knows good from bad," he said.
"He knows that for planting a bomb that kills 250 innocent people, a Muslim would go straight to hell."
NAIROBI, Kenya Nine months before the attack on the American Embassy here, U.S. intelligence officials received a detailed warning that Islamic radicals were plotting to blow up the building, according to Kenyan and American officials.
The warning forecast the Aug 7 bombing in several particulars, the officials said.
It came from an Egyptian man who American officials now believe was involved in the simultaneous terrorist assaults on the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
The Egyptian, Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, is now in jail in Tanzania, charged by local prosecutors with bombing the embassy there.
Since the bombings, the State Department has maintained that it received no specific warnings about threats to its embassies in East Africa.
But late on Thursday, a spokesman acknowledged that the CIA had sent the State Department two reports about Ahmed that prompted the embassy in Kenya to step up security for several weeks.
When no attack materialized, the embassy's precautions returned to normal.
No further steps were taken to improve the building's physical security.
Disclosure of the warning raises new questions about the State Department's protection of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which did not meet the department's own minimum standards for security.
Until now, department officials have insisted that the embassies faced only a minimal threat from terrorists.
In the days after the bombings, the administration acknowledged that it had spurned requests from the American ambassador in Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, to move the entire embassy to a safer location.
The State Department would not say whether her cables mentioned Ahmed's warning.
According to American officials, Ahmed walked into the Nairobi embassy last November and told American intelligence officials that he knew of a group that was planning to detonate a bomb laden truck inside the diplomats' underground parking garage.
In a separate interrogation by Kenyan intelligence officials, which was relayed to the Americans, Ahmed said he had already taken surveillance photos of the embassy for the attack, which was to involve several vehicles and stun grenades, Kenyan officials said.
Analysts at the CIA were unable to link Ahmed to any terrorist group but they nonetheless sent two reports last November about his statements to various government agencies.
The reports, American officials said, included several caveats.
The CIA said that a foreign intelligence service that cooperates with the agency believed that Ahmed was a fabricator of information.
In the reports, CIA analysts said that they could not rule out the possibility that Ahmed's threats were serious.
But they said that the threats might also be a sophisticated ploy by terrorists to observe and then counter the defenses the embassy would take against a possible attack.
After Ahmed appeared at the embassy, American officials alerted their Kenyan counterpars, who questioned the Egytian and then deported him.
Soon after, Ahmed made his way to Tanzania where, American officials now believe, he participated in the Aug 7 bombing of the embassy that left 11 people dead.
The embassy attack in Kenya unfolded that same day much as Ahmed had said it would: A team of terrorists using two vehicles attempted to drive an explosives packed truck into the parking garage.
One of the attackers tossed stun grenades to frighten off the locally hired security guards.
When an exiting car blocked their access to the garage, the attackers set off the bomb.
A Clinton administration official acknowledged that the embassy in Kenya had received a specific warning about an attack.
"It is embarrassing," this official said, quickly adding: "It is tragic."
Asked why the embassy took few steps to improve its security after the warning, he said: "That's the 64 million dollar question."
Other officials defended the government's handling of the case, noting that American intelligence is deluged with warnings about terrorist plots, most of which prove groundless.
Thus far, Tanzanian authorities have not allowed Ahmed to be interviewed, and it was unclear what motivated him to alert authorities about a plot in which he appears to have played a role.
He told the Kenyans that in the past he had provided authorities with information about Islamic radicals because he wanted to see them arrested and rehabilitated rather than caught committing a crime for which they would be executed.
Ahmed has said he is innocent of the charges and his lawyer, Abdul Mwengela, said his client's information about the bombings stemmed solely from a conversation he had overheard the previous year in a Nairobi hotel.
A Tanzanian court refused to release Ahmed on bail this week and ruled that FBI agents would be permitted to interrogate him.
Tanzanian investigators suspect he was a central figure in the plot.
They are now examining whether Ahmed drove one of the vehicles used in the Dar es Salaam bombing and whether the 400 pounds of explosives used in both blasts came into Tanzania in a shipment of rice imported by one of his companies.
The Clinton administration has not sought to extradite Ahmed from Tanzania event though federal law permits the United States to bring charges against anyone who attempts or conspires to murder Americans anywhere in the world.
American prosecutors have already brought to the United States several other people accused of complicity in the bombings or of having ties to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who American investigators have identified as the mastermind of the attacks.
The American Embassy in Dar es Salaam declined to answer any questions about Ahmed and why Washington was not seeking his extradition.
American diplomats in Tanzania, speaking on the condition of anonymity, suggested the prosecution was being left to the Tanzanians because there were no American victims.
A White House spokesman said the case was appropriately handled and that the United States had no plans to extradite Mustafa because the Tanzanians had expressed interest in trying him.
Several non American diplomats in the region speculated that the United States is allowing the Tanzanians to try Ahmed because they fear his trial in America might bring to light his dealings with American authorities and other Western intelligence services.
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania In a rare public statement about the August bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, the FBI said Friday that two vehicles had been used in the attack on the embassy here.
The FBI also indicated that it had learned the identities of new suspects in the blast here, and that they are at large.
They were in a Suzuki Samurai, one of the two vehicles identified Friday, investigators said.
Two vehicles were also used in the bombing of the embassy in Nairobi, according to indictments that have been handed down.
One carried the bomb, the other guided the first vehicle through the streets of Nairobi to the embassy.
Investigators are pursuing the theory that the modus operandi was the same here.
One of the vehicles used in the blast here was an Atlas refrigeration truck made by Nissan, with a silver colored cargo box and white or beige cab, the FBI and the Tanzania Criminal Investigation Division said at a news conference Friday afternoon.
This was the vehicle that investigators now believe carried the bomb, which killed 11 people and wounded at least 86.
The driver of the vehicle, who has not been identified, died in the attack, according to investigators.
The simultaneous blast in Nairobi killed more than 250, including 12 Americans.
Three people have been indicted in New York in connection with the attacks, which the Clinton administration has charged were masterminded by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who lives in Afghanistan.
Friday's development should put to rest earlier reports that a water tanker, which regularly delivered water to the embassy here, had carried the bomb, an investigator said.
The refrigeration truck followed the water tanker into the compound, according to a U.S. security official.
It is not known how the refrigeration truck, a 1987 Nissan, penetrated the embassy compound here without being adequately searched.
At Friday's news conference, FBI Agent Ken Maxwell read a brief statement and declined to take any questions.
The head of Tanzania's Criminal Investigation Division, Adadi Rajabu, read a similar statement in Swahili, and also declined to take questions.
The second vehicle was a Suzuki Samurai, a small jeep popular in East Africa.
It had been "utilized by suspects thus far identified," Maxwell said.
He did not say how it had been used or who the suspects were.
Tanzania has charged two men in connection with the bombing, Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Rashid Saleh Hemed.
For reasons that are not clear, the Clinton administration has not sought to extradite either of these men, even though it has brought other suspects back to the United States, where they have been indicted.
A diplomat here said the United States did not consider the evidence against Ahmed to be very strong.
Since the bombings, the FBI and their counterparts here and in Kenya have made few public statements.
Friday's news conference was for the purpose of issuing an appeal to the Tanzanian public to come forth with any information about the vehicles, an indication that while the investigators feel they have made "a significant amount of progress," as Maxwell said Friday, they are also stymied.
MORONI, Comoros The man accused of directing the bomb attack on the American Embassy in Kenya came of age in this impoverished Indian Ocean archipelago, a land where gifted teen agers leave home to enroll in the radical Islamic academies of Libya, Sudan and Pakistan.
A tightly wound, brilliant student of the Koran who was thrown out of religious school for caning a lazy pupil hard enough to draw blood, Abdallah Mohammed Fazul set out for Pakistan 11 years ago, at age 15, to continue his education.
Sometime over the next few years, American authorities assert, he fell under the sway of terrorists waging what they call a holy war against the United States.
He was transformed into a killer who could coolly execute a bombing that left 250 people dead.
He is still at large after being indicted in the United States under an alias, Haroun Fazil, which he apparently used in Kenya.
As the object of a worldwide manhunt, he has a $2 million reward on his head.
The stark portrait of him as a terrorist baffles his wife, his Koran teacher and relatives in Comoros, a country with a relatively liberal Muslim character.
Even relatives who admit that he had a darker side say his religious fervor seemed limited to mundane things like animosity to television and threats to chase family members into the street if he caught them drinking beer.
Nearly two months after the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, a picture of those charged in the case is slowly emerging.
They lived in different countries, labored in various professions but shared a devotion to radical Islam and a striking ability to keep family and friends in the dark about what American prosecutors say were their true activities.
Comoran officials express embarrassment that Fazil has turned the world's eyes on them.
But they say he is a true product of the forces that shaped his tropical nation poverty, Islam, racism and French colonialism.
He is one of thousands of young Comorans who have been forced by the lack of higher education to leave these strange and beautiful islands, where the world's largest volcanic crater meets startling aquamarine waves, where huge bats flit between the palm trees by day and the moon glows vividly at night, especially during power blackouts.
They study far away, in harsh desert lands where the path to holy martyrdom and the path to a bit of cash for a suffering family back home are the same: Join the legions of the Islamic Jihad.
The indictments filed so far suggest that Fazil was no ordinary legionnaire, but a highly intelligent, natural leader who played a central role in the bomb plot.
His wife's extended family lives in a yellow cinder block building behind a one room Islamic school on an alley paved only with sharp pumice.
They graciously welcomed two journalists into their threadbare rooms, offered coffee and talked for three hours.
His wife, a first cousin who married him five years ago and lived with him in Sudan and Kenya, called him a hard working computer student and said he sometimes disappeared for weeks at a time.
His big brother said he had been a gentle, sometimes boastful child who could "smurf dance like Michael Jackson" and never said anything about hating America.
When pressed, those who knew him said in so many words that they did not know him very well.
His siblings did not see him for years at a time, his wife does not expect a message even though he has been gone more than a month, and his old teachers say he never visited.
Each said, "He has no friends I know of."
According to the FBI, Fazil headed the Kenya cell of Al Qaeda, the terror network founded by Osama bin Laden, an exiled Saudi businessman.
It says Fazil rented the room where the bomb was assembled and drove the white pickup that guided it to the embassy.
On Aug 14, a week after the Nairobi blast, he flew here.
He visited relatives and his local mosque.
On Aug 22, Fazil took a flight to Dubai.
He had a ticket onward to Pakistan, but it went unused, and he disappeared.
His family says he left without explaining, as was his custom, and they drove him to the airport.
Tipped off by Nairobi telephone records that showed calls to a Moroni number, investigators descended on the family home on Sept 2) The Comoran gendarmes were accompanied by FBI agents with pistols and radio headsets, "just like Delta Force" said an uncle.
They took his brother, Omar, as well as his wife, Halima Badroudine Fazul, 22, and sister in law, Nabatte Fazul, 19, in for questioning.
They also seized two computers, diskettes, a camera, CDs and tapes, old letters, passports and birth certificates, two Korans, piles of old Newsweek and Time magazines and Kenyan newspapers, rubber stamps, most of the clothing of the family's men and some belonging to women and children.
The day of the search ended badly.
"The FBI behaved correctly they were not threatening," said Halima Fazul.
"But the Comoran gendarmes tipped my father out of bed to search it, even though he had a catheter in him."
They banged on the ceiling over his bed with their gun butts, she said.
On her way back from the police station that evening, she was told that her father, who had been suffering from a bleeding ulcer, was collapsing.
She ran, stumbling in the dark.
"He took my hand and said, 'Ah, Halima, you're back," and died, she said.
When asked about that later, a prosecutor and a ranking gendarme both shrugged, saying they were unaware that the older man had heart trouble.
No complete listing of the evidence against Fazil has been issued some may still be being tested by the FBI but threads can be pieced together from interviews.
Fazil had passports or ID documents from countries that he is not a citizen of, apparently including Kenya and France, and stamps for forging others.
The Kenyan newspapers he had kept were mostly about the bombing, an investigator said.
There was a list of prominent Comorans who would have to be killed to make way for fundamentalist rule.
Investigators also found a letter he wrote in 1991, when he was 19, to his brother Omar, then 24, in which he boasted that he had been trained to use explosives and fire machine guns.

Solemn faced Kenyans whose relatives were killed in the terrorist bombing of a U.S. Embassy collected benefits on Friday they said failed to compensate for their losses.
"It's not enough, nothing could be enough," Beatrice Akoth Yongo, a widow with four young children and another due in December, said in the shade of a flowering jacaranda tree.
Attorney General Amos Wako, representing the government at the gathering of 100 in downtown Uhuru Park, acknowledged with regret, "This is peanuts for someone who has died."
Yongo was one of 31 relatives paid 100000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs 1667) each from donations that have reached 228 million Kenyan shillings (dlrs 3.8 million).
They came, some from days away, and wore their Sunday best.
Several shed tears as they accepted checks from smiling officials offering condolences.
In the coming days, more of the 213 Kenyan families who lost a relative will be compensated, said Charles Njonjo, chairman of the National Disaster Emergency Fund.
Many families previously received an immediate payment of 50000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs 833) for burial expenses.
Additional payments will be made, if money becomes available, Njonjo said.
A total of 248 people, including a dozen Americans, were killed in the Nairobi bombing on Aug 7.
A twin attack on the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Tanzania killed 11 people, all Africans.
Compensation later will be paid to the most seriously injured among more than 5400 people who were hurt in Kenya, mostly passersby sliced by flying debris, Njonjo said.
Amounts have not been determined.
Nearly two months after the bombings, many people still need physical and psychological help, and not enough is being provided, aid agencies say.
"The needs are very serious and we keep identifying more and more as the days go by," said Amimo Agola of the Bomb Relief Support Unit, an umbrella group for all nongovernmental agencies assisting bomb victims.
A total of 17 people remain in hospital for treatment of serious physical injuries, including broken limbs and backs and amputations, the National Disaster Operations Center said.
Another 200 people need reconstructive surgery, Agola said.
Meanwhile, mangled eyelids are failing to protect otherwise undamaged eyes, hands with severed tendons are turning into useless claws.
Patients, although unable to work and lacking medical insurance, must now pay for treatment that initially was free.
Most rehabilitation programs need money, too, Agola said.
For example, 97 people were fully or partially blinded by flying glass and debris, and need training that the Kenya Society for the Blind can't always afford to provide.
Many patients can't afford to buy the powerful eyeglasses they need.
"The greatest need is that many, many of us have been psychologically traumatized, and very, very few are receiving help," Agola said.
Businesses have started to fire people who have not yet returned to work because they are still upset by the bombing, she said.
Especially heartbreaking are the pleas from people who say they've lost the family's only breadwinner.
In Kenya, as in much of Africa, strong ties of the extended family and the enormous disparity between earnings in the city and the countryside make it common for one urban breadwinner to be the main source of support for dozens of other family members.
The government's social welfare system is hopelessly inadequate, and life insurance is a luxury of the rich.
Some people were angry at the paucity of assistance.
"This is nothing," Esther Dalizu said, waving a compensation check.
Her dead sister was a senior bank employee who had earned the same amount in just a few months.
"The loss cannot be compensated."
Dalizu said she planned to save the money for the education of her sister's 11 year old daughter.
Yongo, 32, said without her husband's salary the family now must live on her earnings of less than half as much.
After she pays the rent on a government subsidized apartment, she has just 1200 shillings (dlrs 20) per month to feed her brood, pay utilities and school fees.
"It has been so difficult," she said, blotting away a tear.
Relatives cannot afford to help her.
Yongo is afraid her husband's dream of university educations for their children has died with him.
"This makes me even sadder," she said.
NEW YORK Several months after the bombing of the World Trade Center in February 1993, one of the suspects tried to bargain with federal prosecutors in New York, offering inside information about the bomb plot in exchange for a lighter sentence.
The deal never materialized, and the defendant was eventually found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.
But the details he offered in that secret meeting about his Brooklyn based circle of Arab militants are resonating today in another terrorism case.
The accused bomber told prosecutors that he had twice turned to a Texas acquaintance named Wadih el Hage to buy weapons for his Brooklyn associates.
Last month, el Hage was arrested on charges of being part of the Osama bin Laden terror network that is suspected of the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug 7) It is not clear how federal investigators followed up the tip about el Hage that they received in 1993.
But after the embassy bombings, it is evident that they are ascribing new significance to el Hage's contacts with the Brooklyn militants who figured not only in the World Trade Center case, but also in the assassination of Rabbi Meir Kahane in 1990 and a conspiracy to blow up the United Nations and other New York landmarks in 1993.
Indeed, the government recently asserted for the first time that the roots of bin Laden's organization could be traced, in part, to a sparsely furnished office on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn that was called Alkifah Refugee Center and had for many years been a gathering place for that same fringe group of terrorists.
Prosecutors have not said what role, if any, bin Laden is supposed to have played in the activities of Alkifah Center.
Nor have they said how the center, which has been closed for about five years, relates to his global campaign to attack Americans overseas.
But in the government's version so far, bin Laden's far flung network is presented as a tapestry of personal relationships between men of different nationalities and backgrounds who share his determination to rid the Islamic world of American influence.
In the United States, prosecutors now suggest, such relationships evolved from Alkifah Refugee Center.
In the mid 1980s the strip of Arab restaurants and Islamic bookstores on Atlantic Avenue, between Third and Fourth streets, was the first port of call for many immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa.
Notices posted in the shops advertised jobs, rooms for rent and religious activities for Arabic speaking newcomers.
Alkifah Center, in those years, was a neighborhood hub.
It started out as a desk in Al Farooq Mosque around 1986 and then moved into a small apartment in a building a few doors away at 566 Atlantic Ave., above what is now a perfume factory, with just enough room for a desk, a few chairs, a phone and a fax machine.
The center's stated purpose was to raise money and recruit fighters to help the U.S. backed Afghan mujahedeen, who rebelled against the Communist government in Afghanistan after an invasion by the Soviet Union in 1979.
People in the neighborhood who remember Alkifah Center say it appeared to be a shoestring operation, although court papers suggest that tens of thousands of dollars flowed through its bank accounts in its heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It was this ramshackle office that the government says evolved into the American outpost of bin Laden's international terrorist organization.
The center was set up by Mustafa Shalabi, an Egyptian immigrant.
As his former neighbors recall him, Shalabi was infused with the same religious fervor for the Afghan cause that galvanized many young Muslims who regarded it as a holy war to liberate a Muslim country from Communist domination.
One of those who answered the call to fight in Afghanistan was Mahmud Abouhalima, who was active in militant Islamic movements in his native Egypt before moving to West Germany in 1981 and to New York four years later.
Abouhalima would later become a well known figure in New York as one of the men accused in the World Trade Center bombing.
Shortly after his arrest in that case, he met with government investigators without his lawyer and provided a detailed account of Alkifah Refugee Center and its internecine rivalries.
He recounted his brief stint with the mujahedeen in Afghanistan and told of traveling with a Palestinian man he knew as Mohammed Odeh to Peshawar, in northern Pakistan, the staging area for the Afghan rebels.
Abouhalima said they had spent two and a half months in separate training camps, learning how to use AK 47 assault rifles and rocket propelled grenade launchers.
Later, they joined a militia unit and fought against Soviet forces with the American financed mujahedeen.
For reasons that remain unclear, prosecutors rebuffed Abouhalima's offer of cooperation.
But his mention of Odeh is intriguing in light of more recent events.
A Palestinian man with a similar name and background, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, has been charged with driving the truck that delivered the bomb in the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi.
He has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial in New York.
Federal officials declined to say whether the Odeh charged in the embassy attack this year is the same Palestinian whose name surfaced five years ago.
In his 1993 statement to investigators, Abouhalima made no mention of bin Laden, although bin Laden is known to have worked in Afghanistan and Pakistan during the war years distributing official Saudi aid money for the mujahedeen.
Not long after Abouhalima returned to New York in late 1988, the Afghan war began to wind down.
The Soviet Union withdrew the last of its troops in 1989.
Two years later, the United States agreed to stop supplying arms to fractious Afghan warlords, and Afghanistan descended into civil war.
Many of the Arab men who had gone to fight, including bin Laden, stayed on but turned their religious fury against secular Arab governments and, ultimately, the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf and in Africa.
The turmoil in postwar Afghanistan echoed in Brooklyn, where Shalabi kept Alkifah Center open.
With the arrival in Brooklyn in 1990 of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric who was later convicted of conspiring to blow up New York landmarks, Abouhalima said, the regulars at Alkifah began to quarrel over money, political direction and leadership.
It was around that time that Abouhalima said he had first met el Hage, a Lebanese born naturalized American citizen, at an Islamic conference in Oklahoma City.
Just how close the two men became is not clear.
Abouhalima's lawyer in his World Trade Center trial, Hassen Ibn Abdellah, said, "That case is over, and I know nothing of the government's information or their sources."
But el Hage was familiar with several of the Arab immigrants associated with Alkifah Center, say prosecutors and the account that Abouhalima provided investigators.
A federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, said in court last month, for example, that el Hage had a relationship with El Sayyid A ) Nosair, the Egyptian immigrant convicted on federal charges in slaying of Kahane.
He did not elaborate.
Abouhalima, who told investigators that he had been in charge of protecting Sheik Abdel Rahman during the cleric's stay in the United States, told investigators that he had gone at least twice to el Hage to buy guns.
Abouhalima said he obtained a 9 millimeter handgun from el Hage in 1990 for use by the cleric's bodyguards.
Abouhalima also told investigators that he later gave el Hage $4000 to buy handguns and AK 47s to defend his associates from the Jewish Defense League in New York, an organization founded by Kahane.
Abouhalima said el Hage had been unable to obtain the weapons and returned most of the money.
The timing of the transaction was not made clear.
The government cited the weapons transaction in a court hearing last month to persuade a federal magistrate to deny bail to el Hage.
Fitzgerald, the prosecutor, said el Hage had acknowledged dealings with Abouhalima.
"The defendant has admitted that while in Texas he made efforts to obtain firearms for Mahmud Abouhalima," Fitzgerald said.
"His claim is that after purchasing the firearms, Mr Abouhalima failed to pick them up."
Abouhalima told investigators of other contacts with el Hage.
He said that el Hage called him from Texas in early 1991 and said Shalabi wanted him to come to New York to help resolve a conflict within Alkifah Center.
At the time, Shalabi's leadership was under fire from dissidents within his circle, including Abouhalima.
El Hage did come to New York.
A short time later, Shalabi was found slain in his Brooklyn apartment.
No one has been charged, and the crime remains unsolved.
Abouhalima said he and el Hage had met one more time in Al Farooq Mosque on Atlantic Avenue, a few doors from Alkifah Center.
The topic of discussion, he said, was Shalabi's troubles and his recent killing.
Prosecutors say that by 1994, el Hage moved his wife and children to Sudan, where neighbors said they knew him as the director of Africa Help, a private aid organization.
But the government said he was the private secretary to bin Laden, who by then had relocated from Afghanistan to Sudan.
Later that year, the government said, el Hage moved to Kenya, where he shared a house for a time with a man named Haroun Fazil and helped bin Laden set up some of his front companies in Africa.
Fazil is accused of playing a role in the August embassy bombings in Africa.
The government appears to have been tracking el Hage for at least a year before the embassy bombings.
In September of last year, he was pointedly questioned by federal agents investigating bin Laden's group.
El Hage, who moved back to the United States in 1997, has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to kill Americans and of lying to federal agents.
In court his lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, denied that his client had any connection to terrorist activities.
McIntyre could not be reached for further comment.
These days, Arab immigrants still congregate along the little strip of shops on Atlantic Avenue, where Arab food and novelties are sold alongside Islamic books.
A few thousand pray at Al Farooq Mosque at the main Friday prayers, but it no longer has a reputation as a hotbed of radical Islamic activity.
Most of the men who were drawn to Alkifah Center in its turbulent days have melted quietly back into their communities, say people in the neighborhood familiar with the center's history.
"In 1994 this mosque finally settled down," said Abdulhakim Ali Mohamed, the American born religious scholar who became the imam, or leader, of the mosque three years ago.
No one is permitted to misuse the mosque to preach politics or hate, he added.
"If there's anything to say," Mohamed said, "I'll say it."
U.S. prosecutors have asked for a 20 day extension to provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden, officials said Saturday.
Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, of Sudan, has been jailed since his arrest near Munich on Sept 16 by Bavarian authorities acting on a U.S. warrant.
Under German law, U.S. officials have 40 days after the arrest to turn over supporting evidence so a German court can rule on their extradition request.
A Bavarian Justice Ministry spokesman, Gerhard Zierl, said U.S. authorities a few days ago asked the court hearing the case for an extra 20 days to provide the necessary material.
Quoting unidentified Bavarian law enforcement sources, Focus newsmagazine reported Saturday that the evidence turned over so far was not very strong.
The magazine said much of it was based on the testimony of an FBI informant, a former bin Laden associate, who made only vague connections between Salim and terrorist activities.
Zierl declined to comment on the report, but said U.S. authorities probably asked for more time just a precautionary measure.
U.S. authorities charge Salim helped finance, train and arm members of a terrorist organization, including the alleged bombers of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
A criminal complaint unsealed Sept 25 in U.S. District Court in New York charges him with murder conspiracy and use of weapons of mass destruction.
NEW YORK Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Wednesday that one of the men accused of conspiring to bomb the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August had met earlier with Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the attacks, and "asked him for a mission."
The reported meeting between bin Laden and the accused man, Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al'Owhali, which had not previously been described, is the strongest allegation offered so far to link bin Laden to the attacks, in which more than 250 people died.
The meeting, which prosecutors said took place in 1996, is reported in a new 48 page indictment of Al 'Owhali and three others that a federal grand jury in Manhattan returned Wednesday.
It shows how prosecutors are continuing to build the circumstantial case that bin Laden, a Saudi businessman in exile, was behind the embassy bombings and other attacks against Americans stationed abroad in the 1990s.
The prosecutors did not indicate bin Laden's response to the offer, he is not charged in the new indictment.
The indictment does not indicate whether prosecutors have any evidence that bin Laden directly ordered the bombings, or whether they may argue that he inspired a group of followers to carry out the attacks.
Bin Ladin has called for attacks on U.S. and other Western interests.
Nonetheless, in issuing the new charges against men suspected of being bin Laden's associates, the government also declared more concretely than previously that bin Laden has been a major backer of terrorism groups worldwide.
Its list of terrorist groups includes Al Jihad in Egypt and the Islamic Group, which is led by Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who was convicted in 1996 in the plot to blow up landmarks in New York City.
The indictment asserted that bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda, worked on its own and through Al Jihad, Islamic Group and others, which "operated under its umbrella."
The authorities also gave their first account of what they called bin Laden's network of businesses and front companies in Sudan that he allegedly used to raise money to support terrorism and to provide cover for the acquisition of explosives, weapons and chemicals, and the travel of his associates.
WASHINGTON The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to U.S. intelligence officials.
The evidence, the officials said last week, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad, an Egypt based group responsible for the assassination there of President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
Islamic Jihad, in turn, receives money and sponsorship from bin Laden and has been absorbed into his terror network, the officials added.
This evidence was uncovered after the United States destroyed Idris' factory in a missile attack following the bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said.
A spokesman for Idris denied the accusations, saying Idris had no ties either to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups.
In a statement provided by Tim Pendry, his London based adviser, Idris said: "I have absolutely no relationship with any Islamic terrorist organization anywhere in the world.
I have never met Mr bin Laden, I have never spoken with him, I have never had any financial or business relationship with him, nor knowingly with anyone acting as his agent."
U.S. officials say they have also received new reports of an increase in the Iraqi presence in Sudan since the missile attack.
Officials said they were not certain what the Iraqis were now doing in Khartoum.
But intelligence agents previously obtained evidence that the manager of the Shifa plant made frequent trips to Iraq, where he visited the head of the chemical weapons program.
In addition, a soil sample that the CIA clandestinely took at the Shifa plant showed the presence of a chemical used in the production of VX nerve gas, a process used only by Iraq.
The new evidence comes as President Clinton faces attack over his decision to strike the Shifa plant.
Some State Department and CIA officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden.
The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been closed since 1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996.
In addition, more than 100 intelligence reports from a CIA informer in Sudan were withdrawn in January 1996 because they proved to be fabrications.
That year a second informer warned of several terrorist threats, including one against Anthony Lake, then the national security adviser, but his reports proved impossible to confirm.
Senior administration officials say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort.
Now they say that the new evidence against Idris has confirmed their initial suspicions about Al Shifa.
At the time of the Aug 20 cruise missile attack, Clinton administration officials acknowledge, they did not know that Idris owned the Shifa factory.
The CIA, which had begun to scrutinize the plant 18 months earlier, believed the plant's ownership was irrelevant.
"What we knew about the ownership was that a lot of it couldn't be reliably established," said one senior U.S. intelligence official.
Still, after the missile strike, when Idris was publicly identified as the owner, U.S. intelligence began to investigate his possible connections to chemical weapons and terrorism.
A Sudanese expatriate who now lives in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, Idris, 46, was previously a senior manager of the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia.
He bought the Shifa plant in March.
Officials say U.S. intelligence has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic groups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is 40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons development.
Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial Corp. in his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production, and talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gases against U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, according to U.S. intelligence.
But Pendry denied that Idris owned any businesses with the Military Industrial Corp. U.S. intelligence officials declined to provide details about the reports of Idris' financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad.
But they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated into bin Laden's terrorist campaign.
WASHINGTON Budget negotiations faltered Friday, prompting Congress to delay until midnight Monday its deadline for passing a spending bill to keep the government open.
Republican leaders vowed they would not let the government shut down.
At the same time, many rank and file members of Congress, suffering from impeachment fatigue and anxious to get home to campaign for the Nov 3 elections, fled Capitol Hill temporarily Friday night in an acknowledgment that any resolution was in the hands of Republican leaders and the White House.
They are subject to return at the call of their leaders to vote on a final package, probably not before Monday.
Meanwhile the chairmen of the spending committees and Republican leaders engaged in on and off negotiations with the White House.
The two sides met twice Friday and were working Friday night, but little overt progress was made on the spending bills as the process devolved into a political blame game, with each side trying to control the message that goes out to voters.
President Clinton said that Republicans were not providing enough money for his education initiatives, including measures to hire teachers and repair schools.
"This budget is purely and simply a test of whether after nine months of doing nothing, we are going to do the right thing about our children's future," the president said.
Rep Robert Livingston, R La., chairman of the Appropriations Committee, responded that he was astounded to see the president on television complaining about Republicans when the White House had failed to propose cuts in domestic spending to make up for the billions of dollars that the president was seeking for his own proposals.
Republicans were keenly aware that the president had successfully blamed them for previous government shutdowns, in 1995 and 1996, and were determined Friday not to let that happen again.
As the negotiations stalled, Livingston asserted, "There's not going to be a shutdown."
The Republicans were responding not only to the president but to a prevailing sense on Capitol Hill that their leaders were giving in to the administration's demands behind the scenes in order to make a quick break from Washington and leave with the political focus on the impending impeachment inquiry.
Democrats appeared more eager to draw out the endgame and were advancing the view that Republicans, in their haste to capitalize on the president's woes in their re election campaigns, were being careless about the budget.
"They're cutting out on everything because they want to get out of here," said Rep Bill Delahunt, D Mass. "The impeachment stuff has been draining on the whole institution.
It's been sucking all the air out."
Rep Jennifer Dunn, R Wash., emerged from a closed door meeting of her colleagues saying she was "disappointed that the president has put us on the defense."
But really, said Rep John Boehner of Ohio, a member of the Republican leadership, Republicans "want to stay here and work, work, work."
A top Republican aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity put the message in plain English: "We're not going to give them the ability to say it's our fault."
But that is precisely the message that Clinton and Democratic leaders tried to convey, portraying the Republicans as blocking bills concerning health care, campaign finance and the minimum wage, even though these measures are not directly related to the 13 must pass spending bills that keep the government going.
Only two of those bills have been signed into law.
Four others have been sent to the president, and he has vetoed one.
The current negotiations are over several contentious items in the remaining seven bills, which are likely to be wrapped up into one big omnibus bill and presented to the president next week.
The Senate added to that bloated omnibus Friday by killing the bill financing the Treasury Department and U.S. Postal Service.
Friday's deadline extension is the second that Congress has sought in two weeks.
The first took Congress through Friday night, even though the new fiscal year began Oct 1.
In other action Friday, the House approved, 300 125, legislation overhauling the bankruptcy code, but the legislation still faced the threat of a veto from the White House and opposition from Senate Democrats who said it failed to rein in abusive credit card lending and marketing practices.
Friday night, however, Democrats withdrew a filibuster threat that would have killed the bill.
Sen Richard Durbin, D Ill. said the Democrats had relented after Sen Trent Lott, the majority leader, told them he would not pass the freestanding bill but instead try to include it in the omnibus spending measure needed to end the congressional session.
WASHINGTON With just five days until money for the new fiscal year runs out, President Clinton and Congressional Democrats on Monday escalated their criticism of Republican leaders for not moving faster on the 13 spending bills needed to keep the government running.
So far, Congress has completed work on only four of those bills.
Congress and the president have adopted a temporary spending measure that expires Friday night at midnight.
Republicans in both houses said Monday that they expected to complete action on three or four other bills but would probably have to roll the remaining legislation into one big catchall package to meet the Friday deadline.
If they do not meet that deadline, they could extend it, although they would probably do so for only a day or two at a time.
If they neither met the deadline nor extended it, parts of the government would shut down.
Rep Richard A. Gephardt, D Mo., the House Democratic leader, was particularly harsh in his criticism of the majority Republicans Monday, five days into the 1999 fiscal year.
"In my view, this is the worst Congress that has ever sat in the United States Capitol, that has achieved less than any Congress that we've ever had," Gephardt said at the White House after meeting with the president.
"Republicans have wasted the entire year and have left the heavy lifting until the last week."
Republicans, whom much of the public held responsible for partial government shutdowns in 1995 96, said Monday that comments like Gephardt's were proof that congressional Democrats and the administration were itching for a fight over the spending bills.
In fact, they said, they suspect that the Democrats would even welcome a shutdown as a distraction from the drive on Capitol Hill to impeach the president.
The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said on Sunday that he was suspicious of the administration.
"I am very disturbed by the ability to work with this White House," Lott said.
"It's a matter of trust, and I'm not sure that as majority leader now I can trust their actions."
Even when the same party controls the White House and Congress, the lawmakers usually leave the difficult negotiations over the spending bills until the end of each session.
But the atmosphere this year is especially charged, with the impeachment process under way just as Congress is trying to wrap up its must do business.
Further complicating matters is that this is an election year, and members are eager not only to leave Washington to campaign but also to insert their pet projects into the spending bills, although they know that the leaders will decide among themselves what the final package contains.
The president has indicated that he could veto at least five of the remaining bills.
On Monday, in one of his most direct and comprehensive formulations on the appropriations process, he stepped up pressure on the Republicans to drop their notion of a tax cut and to enact his proposals on education, the environment and disaster relief the broad legislative themes that could give him some political footing in a showdown with Republicans.
Clinton addressed several issues that Congress will be haggling over in the next few days as House and Senate Republicans try to resolve their own differences.
He asked Congress to approve full financing for the International Monetary Fund, sought money for 100000 teachers and after school programs, and said he was alert to what he called "unacceptable" anti environment provisions.
"These are the priorities of the American people," the president said of his proposals, "and they must be the priorities of Congress in these last days before the election."
Some of the spending bills are being held up because of disputes among Republicans themselves.
For example, conservative House Republicans object to Clinton's request for $14 billion to shore up the reserves of the International Monetary Fund, but many other Republicans, in both houses, want to approve it.
Gephardt framed the impasse this way: "Can the Republican leadership reign in the right wing, the far right wing of the Republican Party, so we can avoid a shutdown?"
Republicans attribute the snags to the president's request for more than $13 billion in emergency spending that they say would break last year's budget agreement.
The four bills that Congress has finished would finance energy and water projects, military construction, defense and the operations of Congress.
In the next couple of days, both houses are expected to complete action on the agriculture bill, the transportation bill, the bill financing the veterans and housing departments and, possibly, the Treasury and Postal Service bill.
Each house will then roll into one big package, or omnibus bill, at least five spending measures that include elements the president has said he will or may veto.
He has threatened a veto on the Commerce bill because of a dispute over how the census would be conducted, the Labor bill over Republican resistance to his proposals for education programs and fuel assistance for low income people, the Interior bill over several environmental provisions, the District of Columbia bill over school vouchers and a prohibition on homosexual couples' adopting children, and the foreign operations bill over the International Monetary Fund and overseas family planning.
Republican aides said the real negotiations, between the House and the Senate and then with the White House, would not start until Wednesday or Thursday, or possibly even Friday.
"It will be a massive, days long conference in a tiny room with no air," one top Republican aide said.
But this aide, and others, predicted that Congress would try to adjourn in time for members to get home by Monday to campaign in local Columbus Day parades.
WASHINGTON With the Republican plan for a big tax cut having died without coming to a vote in the Senate, Congress scrambled Friday to put together a far smaller tax package that could win bipartisan support.
After giving up hope that the Senate would act on an $80 billion, five year Republican tax cut plan passed last month by the House, the House Ways and Means Committee on Friday hurriedly considered and then passed, on a unanimous voice vote, a narrow bill to address some of the tax issues that both parties consider most pressing.
The package would extend a series of expiring tax credits, accelerate an existing plan to allow self employed people to deduct 100 percent of their health insurance premiums and provide a break to farmers who are hard hit by a downturn in agricultural prices.
Rep Bill Archer, R Texas, the committee's chairman, said he hoped that the bill would sail through the House, be adopted by the Senate and be signed into law by President Clinton.
The committee's plan, which could be voted on by the full House as soon as Saturday, would cost $5.1 billion over five years and $9.2 billion over 10 years.
Unlike the original House plan, which called for the $80 billion tax cut to be paid for out of projected budget surpluses, the package approved Friday would be paid for by raising other taxes.
But Archer's plan quickly hit a roadblock when the Senate Finance Committee decided to draft its own legislation, which differs in several small but important respects from the House version.
With Congress racing to deal with a long list of issues before adjourning next week for the midterm elections, the measure's fate in the Senate remained uncertain.
The end of session wrangling over small bore and largely technical tax issues was a long way from what Republicans had hoped for throughout much of the year.
Emboldened by projections that the federal budget surplus would rise substantially in the coming years, they debated cutting taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars before scaling back their aspirations in the face of strong opposition from the president, congressional Democrats and some moderates within their own party.
Even the $80 billion five year plan passed by the House, though, ran afoul of Clinton's demand that Congress set aside any budget surpluses until the nation settles on a plan to deal with the Social Security system's looming financial problems.
Senate Republicans, in particular, feared that supporting any tax cut that relied on the budget surplus would lead Democrats to accuse them of endangering Social Security.
Senate Republicans never formally declared the $80 billion package dead, with Majority Leader Trent Lott hinting all week that he might still schedule a vote.
But most Republicans have acknowledged for some time that the bill would never pass the Senate, largely because the parliamentary rules under which the legislation would be considered would require 60 votes for it to succeed.
Republicans hold 55 seats in the Senate.
The measure passed by the Ways and Means Committee would extend, to the end of next year, a research and development tax credit strongly favored by business executives.
The Senate Finance Committee's version would extend the credit only until the middle of next year, but would also extend a number of other credits not addressed by the House bill.
Both the House and Senate versions would pay for the tax reductions they include largely by closing a loophole used by real estate investment trusts.
WASHINGTON Republican congressional leaders presented the Clinton administration Thursday with a list of lending conditions that they want imposed on the International Monetary Fund in order for Congress to approve $18 billion in new money for the IMF.
Administration and congressional officials said they were hopeful that they could soon agree on compromise legislation to provide the money to the IMF to refill reserve accounts depleted by the fund's attempts to bail out the economies of Russia and three Asian nations.
But they said they were still without a timetable for an agreement.
Citing the turmoil in international financial markets, the White House has insisted that the legislation be approved and sent to the president before Congress adjourns for the year, which could happen this weekend.
While the list of conditions being sought by the Republicans was not made public, congressional officials said it included a demand that the IMF open its books for public scrutiny, that it end the practice of lending to foreign governments at below market interest rates, and that it shorten the lending period on most loans.
The list was presented to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin during a meeting Thursday on Capitol Hill with the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, R Miss., and House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
After the meeting, Rubin told reporters that it had gone well.
"It was a good meeting," he said.
"It was very constructive and we're just going to keep working forward."
Administration officials say the White House is reluctant to accept any legislation that imposes onerous lending conditions on the IMF, especially at a time when the fund needs flexibility to avert a global financial meltdown.
The Senate has already approved the full $18 billion in new fund financing requested by the Clinton administration.
But the House has balked at the request and has so far approved only $3.4 billion.
The talks this week are aimed at satisfying House Republican leaders, who are being pressed by conservatives within their party who have questioned whether the economic crisis that has swept the third world is evidence that the monetary fund has outlived its usefulness.
"I have been as critical about the IMF as many, but given the crisis we have around the world, the U.S. needs to provide leadership," said Rep John Boehner of Ohio, a key Republican in the talks.
He said that given the chaos in international financial markets, the United States was left with no option but to provide the money to the fund.
"The only real avenue is the IMF," he said.
Congressional officials say the House leadership has shown a new willingness to resolve the monetary fund issue and to end a variety of other financing disputes with the White House in hopes of preventing a government shutdown that might distract public attention away from the impeachment investigation of President Clinton.
Moreover, if the United States fails to provide the money other nations might reduce their contributions, leaving the fund short of the $90 billion it says is needed to deal with the current world financial crisis.
WASHINGTON With four days until temporary financing for the government runs out, House Republican leaders Tuesday demonstrated a new willingness to resolve several of the spending issues that had pointed toward a government shutdown.
Republicans want to keep the spotlight on the impeachment investigation of President Clinton and are therefore eager to brush away any matters that might interfere.
They indicated Tuesday that they intended to drop their hard line positions on matters ranging from less money for the International Monetary Fund to a weakened Federal Election Commission to a denial of political amnesty for 40000 Haitians.
Many of these signals distressed House conservatives, who said their leaders were sacrificing their principles to milk all political advantage from the spectacle of impeaching the president.
But they ceded to their leaders' belief that if they could keep the focus on impeachment, Republicans would win substantial majorities in the November elections and then be able to push through their conservative agenda next year with greater ease.
House Majority Leader Dick Armey led the way Tuesday saying he was dropping his insistence on school vouchers in the District of Columbia.
"I walked away, for now, from my school choice bill," he told reporters.
"One of the reasons we are so comfortable with this is that we know we will be back next year with an even larger majority in both the House and Senate, and those things that perhaps we don't get done this year, we can get done next year."
Rep Robert Livingston, R La., said his provision to weaken the Federal Election Commission "could be dropped."
At the same time, Rep Lamar Smith, R Texas, said he "could support a compromise" on amnesty for the Haitians, which he had adamantly opposed.
The conciliatory moves came as Republican leaders prepared to meet Wednesday with Clinton's chief of staff, Erskine Bowles, in the first high level negotiating session on the spending bills, which must be passed by midnight Friday to keep the government running and performing functions like issuing Social Security checks and keeping the national parks open.
"There is movement," said Livingston, the chairman of the appropriations committee.
"Tomorrow is a critical day."
With Senate passage Tuesday of the agriculture bill, Congress has completed work on 5 of the 13 spending measures, with perhaps two or three more in sight before Friday, when the stopgap bill expires.
Another stopgap measure would be necessary if lawmakers went beyond the midnight deadline.
Armey said he expected Congress to negotiate into the wee hours Friday and into Saturday but to pass the spending bills in time for Congress to depart Sunday.
Members are eager to get home by Monday to campaign in local Columbus Day celebrations and to avoid the blame they took at the polls for partial government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996.
Senate Republicans sounded somewhat less promising about wrapping up on time.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters he was worried that the president wanted to veto some bills to distract from his woes.
"We're concerned that they are thinking about a domestic 'Wag the Dog,' take advantage of, you know, some way to change the subject or distract attention from the administration's problems by not coming to an agreement on this omnibus bill," he said.
He said he had not talked to the president since Aug 20 but that Wednesday's meeting was important "to see what they really care about, if anything."
Lott's skepticism reflects the fact that even as some issues appear to be falling away, others remain to be resolved between the House and Senate and then with the White House.
One is the census, a seemingly arcane matter but one that both parties seem ready to go to the mat over.
Republicans want the census to be based on an exact count of every citizen, Democrats say that would miss millions of people in the inner cities and rural areas and that the count should be based instead on statistical sampling.
The difference is crucial to both parties because the census influences federal aid and helps determine the drawing of congressional boundaries, which in turn influences the makeup of Congress.
Some of the most bitter disputes have been between conservative Republicans and their moderate counterparts.
Conservatives, who were balking over more than a dozen issues, essentially hoisted the white flag Tuesday, offering a compromise to agree to keep the government running but also asking that negotiations continue on the matters most important to them.
Rep David McIntosh, R Ind., a leader of the 40 member Conservative Action Team in the House, said conservatives were worried that Republican leaders appeared intimidated by the president's veto threats.
"We are saying to the leadership that if they give up everything to the president and the liberals, we're not sure they're the right people to be leading us," McIntosh said.
The conservatives are most concerned about breaking the spending caps set in last year's balanced budget agreement.
They say that Clinton's request for more than $13 billion in emergency spending, for matters like the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and fixing the year 2000 computer bug, are not true unforeseen emergencies and should have been included in the president's budget request.
They want both Congress and the president to make cuts elsewhere in the budget to make up for these nonemergencies.
Conservatives are also convinced that spending $18 billion on the International Monetary Fund is a waste of money, but Democrats are adamant that the money be provided.
"We aren't going to leave here without it," said Rep David Obey of Wisconsin, the top Democrat on the appropriations committee.
House and Senate leaders said they expected five spending bills to be especially difficult to negotiate and that they would probably be wrapped into one big omnibus package at the end of the week and sent to the White House.
The bills most likely to end up in that package, all of which have drawn veto threats from the administration, have not yet been agreed upon by House and Senate negotiators.
Those bills would finance the following departments and areas: Commerce, State and Justice Departments.
This bill includes the census, perhaps the most contentious issue between the parties.
Foreign Operations.
This bill contains financing for the International Monetary Fund and would restrict United States aid for overseas family planning groups advocating abortion.
Treasury Department and U.S. Postal Service.
The four contentious provisions attached to this bill would block amnesty for the 40000 Haitians, require federal health plans to pay for contraceptives for women who are federal employees, impose federal standards for day care on state and local governments, and weaken the Federal Election Commission by limiting the term of the general counsel and staff director to four years, unless four of six commissioners approved a re appointment.
Democrats said that measure was aimed at removing the current general counsel.
Republicans, deeply divided over these issues, prevented the House from debating this bill last week, and a conference Tuesday failed to resolve anything, although various Republicans said later that they could compromise on some provisions.
Rep Jim Kolbe, R Ariz., said the bill would have the best chance of passing if it were stripped of everything except the measure for contraceptives.
Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education departments.
This bill contains millions of dollars sought by the administration for education programs, including 100000 teachers and expanded after school and summer school programs.
It would also pay for fuel assistance for low income families and job training programs.
Interior Department.
Republicans have attached provisions that the president deems to be anti environment.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Oct 7: In an atmosphere already bitter over impeachment proceedings, President Clinton and Republican congressional leaders are heading toward another nasty confrontation on the budget that threatens to shut down the government.
In this dispute, however, the White House has a strong hand.
Despite his political problems, Clinton is right to insist on legislation free of objectionable attachments to keep government operations going past Friday.
The most offensive riders under consideration would damage natural resources, cut programs for schools and the poor and impose mischievous new curbs on abortion and contraception.
The reason for the latest battle is that Republicans in Congress have been mired in their own budget disputes all year, with hard line conservatives favoring domestic spending cuts, moderates loath to provoke a veto by Clinton and their leaders reluctant to hand him a fight that draws attention from his sex scandal.
In a sign of Clinton's continued leverage, the Republicans caved in Tuesday on the ill advised $80 billion tax cut approved last month in the House, which was to have been paid for out of this year's budget surplus.
The question now is whether they will come to their senses on other destructive measures.
At a time of grave financial crisis around the world, for instance, it would be foolish to reject full funding for the International Monetary Fund, which the Senate has already approved.
House Republicans should also back down on cuts in education programs, fuel assistance for low income people and gratuitous gestures like the attempts to weaken the Federal Election Commission or limit contraceptive coverage in federal employee health benefits.
As they have done in the past, Western Republicans in the Senate have added more than 20 last minute riders to the Interior Department spending bill that would weaken protections for fisheries, wilderness areas and national forests.
House Republicans have badly shortchanged the Everglades restoration program.
Can lawmakers be so out of touch that they would try to capitalize on the president's political difficulties for a backdoor attack on the environment?
One of the more absurd contentions by Republicans is that they need to cut programs to make funds available for such emergencies as assistance to farmers, the troops in Bosnia and the crash program to update the government's computers for the year 2000.
But Congress has long recognized that emergencies may be met without cuts in spending elsewhere.
In the spending and environmental areas, at least, Clinton has set out the right priorities.
He should stick to them even if it means vetoing unacceptable legislation and provoking a fight that lawmakers do not want.
WASHINGTON With three days until temporary financing of the government expires, Republican leaders met Wednesday night with White House officials in their first high level attempt to resolve dozens of spending issues and avoid a government shutdown.
The unresolved issues include financing for the International Monetary Fund, how to conduct the 2000 census, and billions of dollars in extra spending for items that the administration deems emergencies, like the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, the year 2000 computer bug, and disaster relief for farmers.
Speaker Newt Gingrich, Sen Trent Lott and Rep Dick Armey, the majority leader, were hashing out the details behind closed doors in the speaker's office with Erskine Bowles, President Clinton's chief of staff, John Podesta, the deputy chief of staff, and Lawrence Stein, the administration's liaison with Congress.
During a dinner break, Bowles expressed some confidence that both sides could reach agreement but said they would be working all night.
"I think we made some reasonable progress, in general," he said, adding, "I think we've got a chance."
But he said that no specific issues had been resolved and suggested none would be until both sides could define the entire scope of what they wanted.
"Nothing is resolved until everything is resolved," he said.
At the same time, the Republican leaders were trying to smooth over differences in their own ranks to speed the process along.
Over the squawking of both moderates and conservatives, House leaders stripped out four controversial provisions from the nettlesome bill that finances the Treasury Department and the Postal Service.
The provisions sought to weaken the Federal Election Commission, required the government, to provide health insurance coverage for contraceptives for female federal workers, to block amnesty for 40000 Haitians living in the United States and to set federal standards for child care.
Last week, so many House members were so upset with these provisions that they blocked the bill from being debated on the House floor by a vote of 294 106.
But Wednesday night, in a vote of 231 194 along almost strictly party lines, they approved the procedures and paved the way toward passage on the floor.
Rep Nita Lowey, D N.Y., who had shepherded the contraceptive measure through the House, was upset that Republican leaders simply tossed it out in the final bill even though it had passed the full House twice before and a similar measure had cleared the Senate unanimously by voice vote.
"The Republican leaders should be ashamed of themselves," she said.
"They have stomped all over democracy today in their rush to kow tow to their right wing."
This is a familiar theme among Democrats that the Republican leaders are beholden to their conservative rank and file.
But this is increasingly not the case.
As the legislative session hurtles toward its conclusion, almost nothing from the conservative agenda has advanced beyond symbolic votes on the House floor.
Leaders have quite pointedly not held up the spending bills to advance these causes, spurning conservatives equally with moderates in the interests of reaching agreements and avoiding a government shutdown so that they can keep the spotlight on impeachment proceedings for Clinton.
On the Senate side, Republicans were preparing for final passage of the bill financing Veterans Affairs and the Housing and Urban Affairs Department.
That would bring the number of spending bills Congress has completed action on to six, with seven remaining.
Most of those are expected to be wrapped into one big omnibus package, perhaps by Saturday, although the negotiations with the White House Wednesday evening could change everything.
Congress is playing "chicken" with the president and the American public.
The federal government is now running on borrowed time.
The federal fiscal year ends on Sept 30.
There would have been a massive shutdown of federal agencies on Oct 1, except that Congress voted for a "continuing resolution" that supplies emergency funding until Oct 9.
Every year, the president submits his budget requests to Congress in January and February.
Congress has until mid September to consider, fashion and pass the necessary appropriations bills.
But this Congress is playing special interest politics with appropriations bills.
As of Oct 2, only four of 13 appropriations bills had been passed.
And at least three of the bills yet to be voted into law have been threatened with a presidential veto because of the anti environmental riders attached to them.
Eventually, Congress must pass all the appropriations bills, but unless the most egregious of the included riders are removed, the public can expect another government shutdown like the one in 1995 with the closure of national parks, national monuments, public buildings like the Smithsonian and the Library of Congress and the federal agencies that monitor the federal lands across this nation.
Of course, instead of dealing with the issues, Congress can pass another continuing resolution so that the federal government doesn't shut down on Oct 10.
More borrowed time.
More political shenanigans.
There were signs Friday that the GOP leadership in Congress realizes it might lose in its collision course with the president and the American people.
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R Alaska, indicated that he is willing to strip off some of the anti environmental riders he wrote that impact his state.
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R Texas, echoed Stevens, but predicted that next year the GOP presence in Congress would be even stronger and Republicans will get what they want then.
Presumably, the public can expect to see a greater emphasis on raping and scraping the public lands after this election.
But will the GOP leadership swerve enough to avoid a collision in this session?
A number of powerful special interest groups have forked over huge donations to see their wishes put into law: the fishing industry, oil and gas industry, timber and mining companies and agricultural interests.
Approximately 50 anti environmental riders remain attached to various appropriations bills.
Then there is the arrogance factor: On July 24, Rep Bob Livingston, R La., wrote a letter to Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt threatening to defund Babbitt's office, the office of the Department of the Interior's solicitor, the department's public relations offices and its congressional relations offices.
Livingston, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, didn't like what Babbitt had said to the press about his committee's antics.
Livingston received more than $100000 in political campaign contributions from oil and gas, construction and agricultural industries in the past two years.
And on the Senate side of the aisle, the Department of Transportation appropriations bill contains a provision that would allow helicopters unrestricted access to national wilderness areas, national parks and national wildlife refuges in Alaska.
Helicopters are now only allowed in Alaska conservation areas for emergency purposes.
On Oct 1, Babbitt and Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman sent a letter to Sen Richard Shelby, R Ala., chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation in the Senate Committee on Appropriations, condemning the helicopter section of the bill and promising a recommendation for a veto.
Babbitt and Glickman wrote, in part: "This provision would change fundamentally the Alaska experience and undermine wildlife protections and visitor enjoyment in our 'last frontier.'
It clearly hurts Alaska, but also sets a dangerous precedent for wilderness, park and refuge lands throughout the country."
Imagine the "whopp, whopp, whopp" of copter blades somewhere just above your head as you try to enjoy the deep and beautiful silence of the great wilderness areas.
In cold, dense air the sound of helicopter blades carries a long way.
The sound of the blades can have a serious impact on wildlife disturbing nesting seabird and scattering caribou herds during winter when they need to conserve their energy.
And who would use helicopters overflights or dropoffs?
Extractive industries searching for geological formations that promise oil, gas or coal might be interested in using helicopters, wealthy hunters or hikers who want to be dropped off at key locations, and those intrepid sightseers who want to view the Denali National Park or the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge from the comfort of a seat in a helicopter, then drop down to put their feet on the ground for a moment and finally whopp, whopp away.
And, of course, poachers would find helicopter entry and exit a quick and useful tactic.
Congress isn't satisfied to merely violate the deep silences of the wilderness areas and thereby diminish the experience the Omnibus National Parks and Public Lands Act (HR 4570) contains a provision to sell off the people's park lands.
Section 411 of the omnibus bill authorizes the secretary of the Interior to sell, lease, or issue use permits for parcels of land or structures within the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park.
Section 604 authorizes the sale of wilderness land with the Cumberland Island National Seashore.
The bill also would also allow vehicles to drive through this designated wilderness area.
Last week, GOP leaders in the Senate pulled the Interior appropriations bill off the floor after lengthy debate because they didn't want Sen Max Baucus, D Mont., to be successful in adding an amendment that would remove a number of anti environmental riders.
Now there is talk in the Senate of rolling the Interior bill in with several other appropriations measures to create a gigantic funding bill that President Clinton could not veto without serious repercussions.
And the political games continue.
WASHINGTON The Clinton administration has begun to consult foreign governments about changes that will be demanded of the International Monetary Fund under a deal with Congress to provide the fund with $18 billion, administration and congressional officials said Sunday.
The administration requested the infusion of capital to deal with the global economic crisis.
Officials said compromise legislation now being hammered out by the White House and Republican congressional leaders would provide full financing for the fund, but would also demand greater openness in its decision making and new restrictions on its loans.
The fund has traditionally made its decisions about loans to foreign governments in secret.
The White House has portrayed the $18 billion as vital to the IMF as it seeks to avert an international financial meltdown.
After a weekend of negotiations, White House officials and members of Congress said they were optimistic about a deal as part of a larger budget agreement that is meant to prevent a shutdown of the federal government.
"There has been constructive bipartisan discussion," said Gene Sperling, President Clinton's national economic adviser.
"All parties are increasingly confident that both full funding and substantial reforms will be part of the final agreement."
Rep David Obey, D Wis., who is involved in the negotiations, said he believed a deal would be announced soon.
"You can see a solution to that on the horizon," he said, describing the talks on the fund as the "one area" in the budget talks "where we're moving much closer to agreement."
The details of the compromise have not been made public, and administration and congressional officials said at least a handful of issues remained unresolved, specifically about the type of lending conditions that the United States can try to impose.
House Republicans, who had blocked all but $3.4 billion of the $18 billion request, have been seeking a variety of changes in how the fund is run, including an end to loans at below market interest rates and a requirement that loans be repaid within a year.
Republican leaders say new lending conditions would provide more incentive to foreign governments to pursue sound economic policies.
The administration has warned that some of the demands made by congressional Republicans would be impossible to force on the IMF, which has 182 members.
Administration and congressional officials said the administration had begun to consult with other nations that are key donors to head off the possibility that the IMF might balk at new lending conditions.
The $18 billion from the United States would replenish accounts depleted by the fund's efforts to bail out the economies of Russia and three Asian nations.
Other important donor nations are waiting for Washington to act before chipping in their shares.
Rep Dick Armey of Texas, the House Republican majority leader, said on the ABC News program "This Week" that the talks between the White House and Congress were still a "very rigorous business."
He did not predict when the deal might be reached.
"We're working out the details now," he said.
"We're working hard on the language and we'll just have to see."
Armey led efforts in the House earlier this year to block full financing for the IMF, and on Sunday he repeated the criticism often heard on Capitol Hill, from both Republicans and Democrats, that the fund had mishandled the financial crisis that has swept across much of the world in recent months.
"There seems to be now a growing consensus of understanding, even given lip service by the president himself, that the IMF has very likely done more harm in places like Thailand and Russia than they've done good," he said.
"Everybody understands the IMF can have American tax dollars if the IMF is responsible and productive in the world economy," Armey said.
"But we will not continue to give them money to do the kind of harm they've done.
If you've got a fire, you don't subsidize the arsonist."

Eds: UPDATES with four more deaths in Poland AP Photo By ALISON MUTLER Associated Press Writer An Arctic cold wave and accompanying blizzards have killed at least 65 people throughout Europe, police and media reported Monday.
The weather played a role in at least 24 deaths in Romania and Bulgaria over the past three days.
In Poland, 36 people died, most of them homeless or others who passed out in the cold after drinking alcohol, police said.
Earlier police said 32 people throughout Poland had died of cold exposure thus far, but by evening more deaths were reported.
A man was found in Debin, near Czestochowa, some 217 kilometers (134 miles) south of Warsaw and two men were found dead near Lodz, 133 kilometers (82 miles) southwest of Warsaw.
A report on the fourth death was incomplete, police said.
An Arctic cold wave that hit Poland a week ago has killed 32 people, police said Monday.
Most of the victims were middle aged men who had been drinking alcohol and passed out in the cold, according to Grazyna Puchalska of the national police headquarters.
Other victims included homeless people, according to police.
Temperatures in central and eastern Poland over the weekend were as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit).

NATIONAL FORECAST Inclement weather will affect parts of the Northeast on Thursday as developing low pressure lifts Atlantic moisture across the region.
Wet snow will fall in northern Maine and on the high ground of northern New Hampshire and Vermont.
The snow will accumulate several inches in some areas.
Farther south, mixed precipitation will turn to rain in central New England as breezes from the southeast usher warmer air into the area.
Periods of heavy rain will fall in southern New England, punctuated by rumbles of thunder.
Morning showers will give way to drying breezes and breaking clouds during the afternoon in the Middle Atlantic States.
Indeed, temperatures will remain mild in the wake of the storm system, as Arctic chill remains north of the Canadian border.
Sunshine and warmth will cover much of the Plains and Southeast.
Expansive high pressure centered over Arkansas will prompt readings in the 60s and 70s from the western Dakotas to North Carolina.
Meanwhile, clouds and breezes from the northwest will keep the Great Lakes States more seasonal.
The relentless parade of Pacific storms will plague the Northwest as pockets of cold air aloft rotate into the region.

Focus: European Cold Wave On Sunday, snow whitened parts of Capri off the coast of southern Italy, the Mediterranean islandUs first snowfall in ten years.
Meanwhile, as much as 16 inches of snow capped Mt. Vesuvius as an unusually cold air mass invaded western Europe on chilly winds from the east.
Closer to the center of the frigid air mass, temperatures plunged to minus 2 degrees Fahrenheit in Moscow on Nov 17, prompting Russian meteorologists to declare the mid November outbreak the coldest in 20 years.
If steering winds shift and blow across the North Pole from Russia, the chill would invade Canada.
Krzysztof Chmiel knows about being homeless and drinking, so his explanation for the 47 deaths as of Wednesday in Poland's Arctic cold wave sounds plausible.
"They drink methylated spirit and then drop dead," said the 46 year old Chmiel, bundled up in a long, heavy coat at a Warsaw homeless shelter.
"Methylated spirit warms you up really quickly, but you also cool down quickly."
The frigid Arctic air that moved in last week has claimed more than 90 lives across Europe, including 30 in Romania and some in France, Bulgaria and Italy.

The father of one of the Islamic militants who died in the suicide bombing of a crowded Jerusalem market said Saturday he was sad about his son's death but proud of what he had done.
Friday's bombing at the open air Mahane Yehuda market killed the two assailants, injured 21 Israelis and jeopardized the 2 week old Israeli Palestinian peace accord.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat promised to track down the masterminds of the bombing and urged that it not be allowed to set back the new land for security agreement.
"We must work together, Israelis and Palestinians, to confront these terrorist acts that aim to destroy the peace process," Arafat said after the attack on the market, which was swarming with shoppers readying for the Jewish Sabbath.
In a rare direct statement to the Israeli people, Arafat appeared on Israeli TV and promised to "exert 100 percent effort" to catch and punish those who had planned the bombing.
The radical group Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, but Palestinian security officials blamed members of the militant Islamic Jihad.
One of the dead bombers was identified as Yusef Ali Mohammed Zughayar, who lived in an Israeli controlled area north of Jerusalem.
His family said he was 22 and acknowledged he was active in Islamic Jihad.
Palestinian security officials said the other was Suleiman Musa Dahayneh, 23, from a village outside the West Bank town of Jenin.
At Zughayar's house near the Anata refugee camp, dozens of friends and relatives gathered Saturday to mourn, although they could not hold a funeral because the body had not been handed over by Israeli authorities.
"I didn't raise him to lose him like that," said Zughayar's 54 year old father, Mohammed.
"I'm proud, but I'm sad because I loved my son."
Friday's attack was the second suicide bombing since the signing of the peace accord on Oct 23.
On Oct 29, an activist from Hamas killed himself and an Israeli soldier when he tried to ram an explosives rigged car into a bus carrying Jewish schoolchildren.
Arafat called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express sorrow over Friday's bombing, but the Israeli leader told him that for the peace process to continue, the Palestinians would have to significantly step up their war against terrorists.
Israel's Cabinet, which was meeting at the time of the attack, cut short its debate on ratifying the accord, and did not set a date for resuming it.
The Palestinian Cabinet condemned the attack following its own meeting Friday night, but said Israel should not use it as an excuse to halt the peace process.
The toll from the attack at the Mahane Yehuda market was far lighter than might have been expected because the explosives apparently went off prematurely.
Many shoppers in the crowded market saw smoke and flames coming from the car and fled moments before the main blast.
Suitcases were found in the car's wreckage, Israel radio reported, suggesting the attackers may have intended to carry separate parcels of explosives deep into the crowd.
That method was used in an attack at the market 16 months ago that killed the two suicide bombers and 16 others.
Suicide bombers targeted a crowded open air market Friday, setting off blasts that killed the two assailants, injured 21 shoppers and passersby and prompted the Israeli Cabinet to put off action on the new peace accord.
The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, the second suicide bombing since the signing of the land for security accord two weeks ago.
Last Thursday, an assailant tried to ram an explosives rigged car into a bus carrying Jewish schoolchildren in the Gaza Strip.
However, Palestinian security officials said that it was members of the militant Islamic Jihad group which carried out the attack.
The officials identified one of the assailants as Yusef Ali Mohammed Zughayar, 18, of Anata, a refugee camp north of Jerusalem.
Anata, which is under Israeli control, straddles the line between the West Bank and Jerusalem.
Justice Minister Tshahi Hanegbi said that second assailant came from the Palestinian controlled areas.
In a rare direct appeal to the Israeli people, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat appeared on Israel TV during the main Friday evening news program and condemned the bombing as "criminal."
"We must work together, Israelis and Palestinians, to confront these terrorist acts that aim to destroy the peace process," said a grim faced Arafat Arafat, adding that he would "exert 100 percent effort" to track down those involved in the attack.
Arafat also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express his sorrow.
The Israeli leader told Arafat that for the peace process to continue, the Palestinians would have to significantly step up their war against terrorists, a statement by Netanyahu's office said.
The Palestinian cabinet also condemned the attack following their meeting Friday night but added that Israel should not use it as an excuse to halt the peace process.
JERUSALEM A red Fiat belching smoke sent shoppers fleeing moments before it exploded outside a bustling marketplace on Friday morning, killing the two bombers, injuring 24 other people and disabling the U.S. brokered peace effort.
The Israeli Cabinet immediately suspended deliberations on the peace accord that was reached in Wye Mills, Md., last month and called on Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to prove he was cracking down on terrorism.
Reverberating through the heart of downtown, the blast Friday morning was the second since the Israelis and the Palestinians signed the new land for security agreement.
The Israelis believe that Islamic Holy War, a militant fundamentalist organization, bears responsibility for the attack at the heavily guarded Mahane Yehuda market, where terrorists have staged several deadly bombings before.
The attack occurred during the typical Friday shopping rush before the Sabbath.
At 9:40 a.m., the Fiat, chugging along like a car about to quit, began emitting smoke.
The smoke served as the first alarm, followed by a series of small explosions, that sounded like firecrackers.
In the minutes before the final boom, as the car aimed to climb the sidewalk, the police moved quickly to clear the busy area, in an effort to minimize the final toll.
The bombers died, their car blown to bits of twisted metal.
But once the flames ebbed and the thick black smoke cleared, only one victim proved to be badly injured.
"I started running like a crazy person," said Sigal Yitzer, who was recovering from minor injuries in a Jerusalem hospital.
"I thought only of my two 18 month old twins at home, and if I should die, who would be their mother?"
Arafat condemned the bombing, spending the day in meetings in Ramallah with his top security advisers and Cabinet.
But his aides expressed concern that the attack had provided Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, with an excuse for reneging on his commitment to the peace accord.
"I am sure the result of this terrorist action will be to give a gift, an umbrella, to Netanyahu," said Freich Abu Madein, the Palestinian minister of justice.
Implementation of the accord was supposed to have begun last Monday, but the Israelis delayed it, with Netanyahu insisting he needed the approval of his Cabinet and Parliament first.
Then, he postponed convening his Cabinet, demanding written guarantees that the Palestinians would arrest 30 fugitives.
When the Israeli ministers finally met, in a rambunctious all day session on Thursday, they indicated that they might give the peace accord only conditional approval, if any.
They had just reconvened on Friday morning when they received news of the explosion.
They immediately moved to suspend their vote on the accord and thus, its implementation until Arafat declared "all out war" on terrorism, according to Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh.
"We expect Arafat to do what is being demanded of him," said Silvan Shalom, the Israeli minister of science.
"He needs to combat the terror infrastructure.
He has done that in the past and he needs to do so now."
Netanyahu issued no public statements.
He did not visit the scene, and he did not visit the injured at the hospital.
Egypt's president says there is "virtually nobody" who believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will implement the latest peace deal with Palestinians.
In an interview published Saturday, President Hosni Mubarak said if Netanyahu wants to change that perception he must boldly face the setback to peace caused by Friday's car bombing in Jerusalem that killed the two bombers and injured 21.
"I tell the Israelis that the solution does not lie in freezing negotiations," Mubarak was quoted as saying by the government run Egyptian Mail newspaper.
Mubarak is a key player in Middle East peace negotiations and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat regularly consults him.
Mubarak's comments reflect the popular Arab feeling that Israel is insincere about peace, and that it only looks for excuses to retain control over West Bank.
Mubarak said explosions are a worldwide occurrence.
But "does life come to a halt?
On the contrary.
The peace foes who are many should be denied the chance," he was quoted as saying.
Following Friday's bombing, Netanyahu's right wing Cabinet suspended the ratification of an interim peace deal he reached last month with Arafat at Wye River in the United States.
Under the accord, Israel agreed to relinquish a further 13 percent of the West Bank and Arafat promised to develop a plan to uproot terrorists on Palestinian controlled areas.
Mubarak said that even as the accord was signed Oct 23 he was cautioning that implementation of the deal was more important than words.
"This is because I felt apprehensive what occurred (in Jerusalem) would happen," he said.
However, that is no reason to go back on the accord, he said.
"I tell ,Netanyahu that there is virtually nobody who trusts that you will carry out the Wye River accord.
Should you want to change this perception, you have to take the initiative and make practical steps to comply with ,the agreement," Mubarak was quoted as saying.
Failure to do so will only ensure recurrence of violence, he said.
"The Palestinians are beset with frustrations from all sides.
So when a ray of hope appears for them on the horizon, they should be supported, not the other way round," he said.
On normalizing Arab Israeli ties, Mubarak said the two peoples should accept the idea first before anything is imposed by "supreme decrees."
And people can only be won over by "sowing the seeds of trust, by handing over land to their rightful owners and respecting treaties and accords." he said.
WASHINGTON President Clinton expressed sympathy to Israel Friday after a car bomb explosion in a Jerusalem market wounded 24 people but said the attack should not derail the recent land for security deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
The president said the accord that he helped mediate last month was "the best way to safety for the Israelis, the best way to achieve the aspirations of the Palestinians and, in the end, the only answer to Friday's act of criminal terror."
Two suicide bombers died in the attack in Jerusalem, which appeared to be an effort to undermine the Wye agreement, named for the Maryland conference center where the settlement was reached last month.
"When Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat signed the Wye River agreement, they knew they would face this moment," the president said, interrupting a bill signing ceremony at the White House to discuss the bombing.
"They knew when they went home, both of them would be under more danger and that terrorists would target innocent civilians, they knew they would have to muster a lot of courage in their people," he said, expressing "my sympathy to the people of Israel, who this morning were once again the target of a vicious terrorist attack."
"No nation should live under the threat of violence and terror that they live under every day," he said.
"I ask for your prayers and support today for the Israelis and the Palestinians who believe in this agreement and who are determined to carry out their responsibilities."
Under the Wye accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel agreed to relinquish a further 13 percent of the West Bank, and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, promised to crack down on Palestinian terrorists.
The State Department said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had telephoned Netanyahu to express her condolences and to urge him to move quickly, despite the violence, to carry out the agreement reached with the Palestinians.
The latest terrorist attack prompted the Israeli Cabinet to delay further consideration of the agreement, a decision that Albright said was appropriate as long as it was temporary.
"It is customary for there to be a short pause in the wake of this kind of attack," she said at a news conference after speaking with Netanyahu.
But she added: "It is important for the Israeli Cabinet to resume its deliberations quickly.
I believe, based on my conversations with the prime minister, that he wants to find a way to do this."
Suicide bombers targeted a crowded open air market Friday, setting off blasts that killed the two assailants, injured 21 shoppers and passersby and prompted the Israeli Cabinet to put off action on the new peace accord.
The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, the second suicide bombing since the signing of the land for security accord two weeks ago.
On Oct 29, an assailant tried to ram an explosives rigged car into a bus carrying Jewish schoolchildren in the Gaza Strip.
The Mahane Yehuda market several square blocks of narrow, stone walled lanes and wooden stalls heaped high with fruit, vegetables and spices was packed with shoppers making last minute purchases before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
The blast sent a billowing cloud of black smoke pouring into the air.
Shoppers many of them Orthodox Jews clad in sweeping skirts or long black frock coats fled in panic, some scattering their purchases on the street.
At the market's entrance, the assailants' red Fiat was reduced to a mass of twisted metal, with only the steering column left intact.
Next to it was a charred body cut nearly in half by the force of the blast, a few feet (meters) away was a second body, bare legged and face down in a pool of blood.
Police said they had determined the identities of the assailants, but refused to release any details.
Witnesses' accounts suggested the blast had gone off prematurely, perhaps averting a much larger loss of life.
Onlookers said they saw smoke and flames coming from the car and heard a series of popping explosions before a larger blast shook the area.
By then, people had already started running away.
"When the big explosion went, there were not that many people nearby," said witness Yaakov Shlomo.
"That was a miracle from heaven."
Almost all the injuries were minor, from flying debris, by nightfall seven people remained hospitalized.
Blasted apart suitcases were found in the car's wreckage, Israel radio reported, suggesting that the attackers had perhaps intended to carry parcels of explosives deep into the crowd.
That method was used to deadly effect in an attack at the market 16 months ago that killed the two suicide bombers and 16 others.
Israeli officials acknowledged that the toll was remarkably light for an attack surely meant to kill and maim many, but said it still showed the daily danger Israelis face from Islamic militants.
"We can't depend on miracles we need to fight the cycle of terrorism," said Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
He and other Cabinet ministers, who were in the midst of debate over ratifying the agreement at the time of the attack, cut short their session and did not schedule a date for resumption.
David Bar Illan, a top aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he still expected the accord to be ratified eventually.
But the suspension of debate will almost certainly bring delays in the tightly timed 12 week schedule for implementation.
The Cabinet it would take up the accord again only after verifying "that the Palestinian Authority is taking vigorous steps for an all out war against terrorist organizations."
Palestinian officials denounced the attack and urged Israel not to let it hold up the accord.
"I hope that at this critical period, we will concentrate on the bigger picture," senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said as he headed into a meeting of the Palestinian Cabinet.
"The answer to extremists on both sides sworn to sabotage this process must be a big 'No."
He also urged the United States to step in and make sure that Israel will ratify the accord.
Immediately after the bombing, small but furious protests by right wing Israelis broke out.
"Death to Arabs!
Death to Arafat!" a dozen or more demonstrators shouted from behind the police barricades.
Several were arrested.
At times like this, Israel has a small town feel, within moments of the blast, people all over Jerusalem knew of it.
In the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall, itself the scene of a suicide bombing 14 months ago, people in open air cafes clustered around radios, listening, nodding and relaying the news.
"Bomb, Mahane Yehuda," they told passersby.
Yair Cohen, 45, a bus company worker who was shopping at the market, said that moments before the blast he had given money to a beggar on the street as a "mitzvah" a good deed that observant Jews believe will help lead to their own salvation.
"I said to myself, 'Maybe this will save my life," he recounted later at the hospital, his gray T shirt stained with blood where he was hit by flying shrapnel.
"And ten minutes later, there was the explosion and I really did escape death."
Islamic militants are pulling out all the stops to keep the new U.S. brokered Israeli Palestinian peace accord from becoming reality.
In recent days, suicide bombers have attacked an Israeli school bus in the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem's outdoor market.
Last month, grenades were hurled at a bus stop in the southern city of Beersheba.
But the failure of those attacks and others to inflict major casualties marks a change from past terrorist spectacles and is an indication that Israeli and Palestinian efforts may have already weakened the militants.
In Friday's market attack which was initially claimed by the largest militant group, Hamas, but later blamed on activists from the smaller Islamic Jihad group Israel radio quoted police as describing the explosives as an "amateur bomb."
It killed the two bombers and injured 21 Israelis.

Islamic militants are pulling out all the stops to keep the new U.S. brokered Israeli Palestinian peace accord from becoming reality.
In recent days, suicide bombers have attacked an Israeli school bus in the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem's outdoor market.
Last month, grenades were hurled at a bus stop in the southern city of Beersheba.
But the failure of those attacks and others to inflict major casualties marks a change from past terrorist spectacles and is an indication that Israeli and Palestinian efforts may have already weakened the militants.
In Friday's market attack which was initially claimed by the largest militant group, Hamas, but later blamed on activists from the smaller Islamic Jihad group Israel radio quoted police as describing the explosives as an "amateur bomb."
It killed the two bombers and injured 21 Israelis.
Yaakov Perry, former head of the Israeli Shin Bet, told The Associated Press that raids by Israeli agents and, in recent weeks, by Palestinian security forces as well have led to the arrest of key leaders and the killing of expert bombmakers.
"There is a weakness both in the explosives used and the engineers, the experts who can put together the bomb, and there is also a problem in the quality of the terrorist themselves," he said, adding recent attackers appeared poorly trained.
Abdel Satter Qassem, a professor at An Najah University in the West Bank town of Nablus who is familiar with the thinking of the Islamic leadership, said Friday's attack came in response to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's recent crackdown on the radicals.
As part of that campaign, Hamas founder and spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, was placed under house arrest last week.
"It is a message (to Arafat) that if you are going to keep your promises to the Israelis and hit hard on Islamists there will be a response that will curb your efforts to reach agreement with Israel," Qassem said.
He said last week's Gaza car bomb that narrowly missed a school bus with 40 children aboard was in response to Israel's killing of two Hamas leaders, Adel and Imad Awadallah in September, and the death of master bomb maker Mohiyedine Sharif in March.
Perry and another former Shin Bet chief, Carmi Gilon, said the Israeli Cabinet decision to suspend consideration of the Mideast peace deal reached at the Wye summit in Maryland was a mistake that only encouraged Hamas and other groups.
Gilon said the aim of the militants was to "ruin the whole process.
I'm just sorry our Cabinet made such a decision which is exactly the aim of Hamas to stop Wye."
In 1995 and 1996, a series of suicide bombings by Islamic militants claimed scores of Israeli lives and halted the peace process, bringing to power the hard line government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Arafat's police rounded up the militants then, but the activists were later released from jail.
David Bar Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, said it was impossible to continue the troop withdrawal process because Arafat's forces were doing so little.
He predicted that the militants would keep attacking until Arafat's police uprooted the sources of support including charities that collected money, teachers that recruited the youth and clergy who encouraged attacks.
He said Israel was merely lucky that recent attacks hadn't claimed more casualties.
"We can't rely any longer on miracles.
We have to have some action on the part of the Palestinian Authority," Bar Illan said.
At a rally in the Gaza Strip several hours after Friday's market bombing, a former Hamas activist who is now in Arafat's Cabinet said Netanyahu's policies, such as building Jewish settlements in the West Bank, were to blame for the attacks.
"We want to tell him that if you put pressure on the Palestinian people and against the Palestinian organizations, those groups will point their arrows against you," Communications Minister Imad Falouji told the crowd.
Falouji shared a platform with Abdallah Shami, leader of the Islamic Jihad, a militant group sponsored by Iran, who affirmed "our right to fight the occupiers as our religion and laws dictate."
Many in the crowd cheered.
EDITOR'S NOTE Nicolas B. Tatro, based in Jerusalem, is The Associated Press chief of bureau for Israel.
A car bomb blew up Friday in a Jerusalem market crowded with Israelis shopping for the Sabbath.
The blast killed two assailants, wounded 21 Israelis and prompted Israel to suspend implementation of the peace accord with the Palestinians.
The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has been trying to sabotage the agreement, claimed responsibility for the 9:45 a.m. (0745 gmt) attack in the Mahane Yehuda market.
Palestinian officials condemned the attack, but accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of political blackmail for holding up the agreement that was to give the Palestinians another 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January.
In the attack, a red Fiat drove slowly toward the main intersection at the market entrance, smoke coming out of the hood and windows.
"People started to shout 'car on fire," said Yair Cohen, a bus company employee.
Rahel Zaken, waiting in line at a bakery to buy Sabbath bread, turned toward the street and got a glimpse of the driver.
"I saw his eyes.
He looked right at me," said Zaken, a 32 year old secretary.
Seconds later, an explosion shook the area.
"I fell to the ground and stumbled over one of the beggars and crawled away on my hands and legs," she said.
She was hospitalized after complainging of ringing in the ears.
Others said they heard two explosions, followed by fast pops, like the sound of firecrackers.
Israel radio said two suitcases filled with explosives were recovered near the car, suggesting the blast went off prematurely and that the assailants had planned to set off a more powerful explosion.
Friday's bombing marked the third time in less than three weeks that Hamas tried, but failed, to carry out an attack with large numbers of Israeli casualties, suggesting that a recent crackdown by Israel and the Palestinian Authority has produced results.
A charred, dismembered corpse, covered by tires, lay several meters (yards) away.
Streams of soot black water ran in the street.
Another bare legged body lay in the street, face down, in a pool of blood below the head.
Rescue workers covered the body with sodden pieces of cardboard box and plastic shopping bags.
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said the two dead were the assailants.
Asked about Hamas' apparent difficulty to launch a large scale attack, he said: "We can't depend on miracles."
The explosion turned the car into a mass of twisted metal, and a large cloud of smoke engulfed the area.
"There was hysteria, people were running," said Eliad Duan, an Israeli border policeman.
Soldiers and police held back the crowds.
"It's dangerous stay back!" they shouted.
At police barricades set up along Jerusalem's busiest thoroughfare, soldiers and police held back crowds of people, some frantic about loved ones who had been shopping in the crowded market only hours before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
"Please, please, is there a girl with red hair who is hurt?" an older, heavyset woman said tearfully, trying to push her way past police.
A young female soldier patted her arm consolingly.
Two policemen led away an elderly woman who gripped a blue plastic shopping bag filled with groceries.
A small crowd of protesters shouted, "Death to Arabs!
Death to Arafat!"
Police tried to grab one of them, but he escaped into the crowd.
Just a block away from Friday's blast, shoppers went about their business.
"We can't stop with what we are doing when this happens," one young female shopper said.
In July 1997, two Islamic militants blew themselves up just a few meters (yards) from the site of the latest explosion, killing themselves and 16 shoppers.
When Friday's blast rocked downtown Jerusalem, the Israeli Cabinet had just gathered about a mile (kilometer) away, at Netanyahu's office, to discuss the peace agreement under which Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for a Palestinian campaign against Islamic militants.
The agreement cannot be implemented until it is ratified by the Cabinet.
Netanyahu adviser David Bar Illan said at the start of the session that he had expected a vote later Friday.
However, the session broke off when word of the attack reached the ministers.
The meeting was resumed shortly after noon, with ministers deciding to suspend the ratification process.
The Cabinet said in a statement will only reconvene after "it verifies that the Palestinian Authority takes vigorous steps for an all out war against terrorist organizations and their infrastructure."
The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, condemned the attack, but said Israel was playing into the hands of the militants by suspending the peace process.
He also said the Palestinians were doing all they could to stop the violence.
"I wished that the Israeli government would not point its finger at the Palestinian Authority," Erekat said.
Bar Illan said ratification was possible as early as next week if the Palestinians take decisive steps against militants.
The Cabinet also demanded clarifications from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on the procedure for revoking clauses in the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
The Wye River agreement refers to the procedure, but is vague enough to allow different interpretations.
It says the Palestine National Council and other Palestinian organizations will meet in mid December to "reaffirm" a letter by Arafat to U.S. President Bill Clinton in which the Palestinian leader spells out which clauses are being annulled.
The Palestinians dispute Israel's contention that the agreement calls for the PNC to hold a vote on the clauses.
The Cabinet also said it would act to strengthen Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Israel radio initially said the ministers decided to begin construction of the controversial Jewish neighborhood of Har Homa in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem next.
Bar Illan said construction would be authorized "in the near future," but would not give a date.
A car bomb exploded Friday in a Jerusalem market crowded with Israelis shopping for the Sabbath.
The blast killed two, apparently the assailants, and wounded 21 Israelis.
In response, Israel's Cabinet suspended implementation of the new peace accord with the Palestinians.

"The government of Israel will resume the discussion of the agreement after it verifies that the Palestinian Authority is taking vigorous steps for a relentless fight against terrorist organizations and their infrastructure," a Cabinet statement said.
The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat condemned the attack, but said Israel was playing into the hands of the militants by suspending the peace process.
"I wished that the Israeli government would not point its finger at the Palestinian Authority," Erekat said.

WASHINGTON As several of its members observed, Monday's debate and votes in the House Judiciary Committee marked only the third time in the nation's history that impeachment of a president has been formally considered on Capitol Hill.
In that limited sense, the approval of a full scale impeachment process was historic.
But it was by no means decisive, no matter how much the legislators huffed and puffed.
It was only a first short step along a rocky road whose length is not known not by President Clinton, not by the public and not even by committee members (although the chairman, Rep Henry Hyde, R Ill., said this weekend that he hoped the House of Representatives could finish its work before year's end).
"The Constitution provides our compass," said Rep Edward Pease, R Ind. "I intend to follow it."
But neither he nor his colleagues could say for sure where it would ultimately point.
Meeting in the same room where Richard Nixon's fate was sealed a quarter century ago, Republicans stressed parallels to that era.
This case is about law breaking, they said, and not about illicit sex.
To which Rep John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the committee's senior Democrat, retorted: "This is not about Watergate.
It is about an extramarital affair."
That is the fault line, so far unbridgeable, between the two parties.
People in Washington universally assume that the House as a whole will vote later this week to ratify the committee's decision.
The Republicans have the votes to prevail.
But if only Republicans support the procedural plans set out by their leadership, as was the case in the final vote Monday night, the decision will be seen by many in the country as a purely partisan proposition.
That next roll call will help set the tone for what lies ahead.
If only a half dozen Democrats join the Republicans, the image of trench warfare will be reinforced and the subsequent inquiry will begin under something of a cloud, if 50 or 75 do so, the vote will confer a greater degree of legitimacy.
The more the average voter thinks that the Republicans are ganging up on the president, his strategists believe, the better his chances of surviving.
Of course, consensus or something approaching it may develop later.
Only well into the final stages of the committee's 1974 hearings on the impeachment of Nixon did significant numbers of Republican members join the Democrats in concluding that Nixon had committed impeachable offenses.
The fact that they finally did led people on both sides to judge its actions fair.
In the other case of presidential impeachment, Andrew Johnson survived a Senate trial because just enough members of the opposition party broke ranks and voted to back him.
Once this week's votes have been taken, attention will shift to the midterm elections on Nov 3.
The conventional wisdom in Washington has shifted rapidly in recent days, from a belief in the days before the release of Kenneth Starr's report that changes would be minimal, especially in the House, to a suspicion that Democratic losses would be large, which took hold in the days before the tape of Clinton's grand jury testimony was released.
Now there is a growing conviction that the Republicans erred by releasing the tape, creating a backlash that could help marginal House Democrats.
Two caveats seem in order, however.
While the president's troubles seem less likely to influence Senate races, Democrats were in big trouble in those without any drag from Washington.
A number of independent analysts see Republican gains of four to six seats.
Major losses in the House are still possible, too, perhaps 20 or more seats if Republican voters turn out en masse and Democrats do not.
"I'm astonished," said a senior Republican senator on Capitol Hill, who comes from the Sun Belt.
"Differential turnouts aren't really very common, you know.
But this year, Democratic voters seem to be in a sulk, and the Republicans act like they'd turn out even if it snowed on Election Day."
Big gains might embolden Republican legislators in their pursuit of Clinton.
But the political terrain is tricky.
After November, both parties will have to play to the 2000 electorate larger, spread more broadly across the economic scale, and less intensely partisan and that might have a tempering effect on the zeal of the Republicans in Congress.
The detailed terms of the case developed by the inquiry, and how it is developed, will have an impact as well.
Unshakeable as the preconceptions of many committee members sounded Monday, experience suggests that over a long period, some of them and some others in the House will change their minds.
If Clinton and Monica Lewinsky are called as witnesses, their deportment will certainly influence some representatives.
How they and their interrogators behave will influence voters as well.
Clinton is a formidable persuader, and any attempt to break down his testimony would run the risk of alienating people who would sense disrespect for the presidency.
A foreign crisis a genuine foreign crisis, as opposed to one that the administration was suspected of inventing could radically change the context of the inquiry, too.
Republicans might find themselves under fire for distracting the commander in chief from important security responsibilites.
And what of the topics other than Ms Lewinsky that Starr has investigated?
Hyde insisted Monday night that the independent counsel was still pursuing the original Whitewater matter and other controversies, one of the committee's ranking Democrats, Rep Barney Frank of Massachusetts, insisted that no more would be forthcoming from Starr.
Ambiguity keeps the pot boiling, wrapping up the other cases would take some of the steam out of the House inquiry.
All of those ideas, all of those possibilities will be in the air as the House debates impeachment in November and December.
Depending on how they coalesce, the Republican leadership might or might not be receptive to a compromise, either before a committee vote or after a committee vote to approve articles of impeachment, before ratification by the House as a whole.
At any time, of course, Clinton could change his mind and decide to resign.
Nixon's decision to quit came after the committee had voted.
But it was motivated by the emergence of new evidence (the "smoking gun") more than the vote itself, plus the belief he could not win in the Senate.
Clinton's aides say he would rather be a second Andrew Johnson, surviving in the Senate by a tiny margin, than a second Richard Nixon.
As things now stand, he would appear to have a good chance of getting the 34 votes he would need (one third of the total plus one) to win a Senate trial.
But that is not chiseled in stone, either.
The Republicans could have 60 seats by the time the case reached the Senate.
In that case, if they lost none of their own partisans, a switch of only seven Democrats would doom Clinton.
A remote possibility, certainly, but then so much of what has happened so far in this case seemed highly improbable until it happened.
WASHINGTON Rep Louise Slaughter has not been a big fan of her fellow Democrat Bill Clinton.
She thinks that he was a major reason the Democrats lost control of Congress in 1994, that he has struck one too many deals with the Republicans, and that his behavior has been reckless and abhorrent.
Two months ago, she was on the verge of urging him to resign.
But as the House prepares to vote on whether to open an impeachment inquiry into the president, Ms Slaughter, from Rochester, N.Y., finds herself deeply torn.
As much as she would not mind seeing Bill Clinton out of office, she worries that Congress is about to start down a path the Founding Fathers never envisioned.
"I'm not interested in what happens to Bill Clinton," she said.
"It's the country and the Constitution I'm concerned about."
Rep Jim Maloney, D Conn., is in a different bind.
He is locked in one of the toughest races of any House member, against a challenger who has made Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky a major campaign issue.
Yet Maloney also believes that the majority of his constituents are fed up with demeaning investigations into the president.
So while the freshman congressman could support a limited investigation, he remains painfully uncertain about how to vote on what may be the only alternative available to him: a Republican plan that would allow an open ended inquiry that he fears could drag on for years.
"If we do that, we'll just be opening the door to the partisan mischief that has been going on for so long around this place," he said.
Across Capitol Hill on Wednesday, the fence sitters in Washington's impeachment debate were consulting constitutional scholars, meeting with colleagues and spouses, rereading the Federalist Papers and studying their political tea leaves, searching for any inspiration that could help tip their mental scales one way or the other.
Most were preparing to follow party lines, but among that dwindling group of undecideds are two large groups of Democrats facing different pressures.
On one side are people like Ms Slaughter, who have become deeply disaffected with Clinton, and who believe he has done little to advance the congressional Democrats' agenda and now feel hesitant about helping him out of his bind.
On the other are people like Maloney, who are locked in tough re election fights and who are concerned that appearing soft on Clinton will infuriate swing voters.
"What will I do before I decide?" asked Rep Bill Pascrell Jr., D N.J., who is also among the fence sitters.
"I'll pray.
And then I'll move on."
In an interview in her Capitol Hill office, Ms Slaughter said Clinton would not be a factor in her decision.
"He happens to be occupying the important spot there, and I want to do what I can to preserve the presidency," she said.
But she recalled with evident disgust a phone call in August from a White House official who was looking for "Senator Slaughter" and who expressed surprise that she had an office in Rochester.
"That's how far down the list I am, I guess," she said.
She also said Clinton's poor relations with congressional Democrats had hurt the party's congressional candidates in 1996 and 1994) "He didn't say this, but Dick Morris said it for him: Bill Clinton didn't care who ran for Congress," she said.
Ms Slaughter said she was prepared in August to call on Clinton to resign, but backed away after seeing his videotaped performance for the grand jury.
"I thought his rights were, frankly, abridged terribly," she said.
"No other human being in the United States would have been subjected to that."
In recent days, Ms Slaughter said, she had been speaking to constitutional scholars about impeachment precedents, and meeting with small groups of colleagues from both parties who remain undecided.
At this moment, she is leaning toward voting against an inquiry.
"We're not trying to get by an election, or get by a hard spot here," she said.
"What we do here has ramifications far beyond our lives."
Maloney said he had been studying the report of the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, reviewing Clinton's rebuttals and videotaped testimony, talking with friends on the House Judiciary Committee and trying to listen to constituents.
The latter group, he says, falls into three equal subgroups: those who want the matter dropped, those who want Clinton impeached, and those who want some lesser punishment.
Maloney, a former state senator, represents a western Connecticut district that was held by Republicans for many years, including Gov. John Rowland, until Maloney wrested it from Rep Gary Franks in the Clinton landslide of 1996.
Since then, Maloney has tiptoed across party lines on many occasions, including to support a Republican tax cut plan this year.
Maloney's Republican opponent, state Sen Mark Nielsen, has called on Clinton to resign, and said Wednesday that he would make it an issue if Maloney votes against an impeachment inquiry.
"The Congress can't turn a blind eye to President Clinton's criminality," he said.
"And the congressman from the 5th District can't be a part of the Clinton defense strategy."
Maloney contends that such talk only turns voters off and that a more thoughtful approach is what will sell in November.
"I have said this doesn't belong in politics," he said.
"I read the Constitution in a given way.
It isn't anything goes."
Maloney said he would support a six month inquiry with well defined parameters, which could include the Lewinsky matter and any other matters referred by the independent counsel.
If the House can agree to such a bipartisan plan, Maloney said, his decision on Thursday will be easy.
"But that's not what I'm expecting," he said.
NEW YORK Anyone following the U.S. Senate race in New York this year could be forgiven for concluding that this is one of the epic ideological battles of the 1990s: the right wing extremist, Sen Alfonse D'Amato, versus the ultraliberal Brooklyn congressman, Charles Schumer.
On one side is D'Amato, who, as Schumer said again Sunday, voted to cut Medicare, opposed abortion rights and battled environmentalists.
On the other is Schumer, who, as D'Amato likes to say, voted against crime bills, opposed welfare restrictions and supported a series of tax increases.
But the truth behind these ideological caricatures is considerably more complex, despite the best efforts of Schumer and D'Amato to confuse it.
These two candidates for Senate are, in fact, political hybrids, masters of the fluid school of politics and ideology that has emerged in U.S. elections in the 1990s, and very much in the tradition of such successful politicians as Bill Clinton, Rudolph Giuliani and George Pataki.
Like Clinton, who campaigned in the New Hampshire Democratic primary in 1992 on a promise to slash welfare, and Pataki, who ran for New York governor in 1994 by embracing the environmental movement, D'Amato and Schumer have defied just enough of their parties' orthodoxy to resist easy characterization.
Their legislative histories are certainly littered with votes that permit their opponents to paint them as extreme, like Schumer's voting in the state Assembly to weaken drug laws, or D'Amato's championing of much of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's Contract With America.
But like most New Yorkers or more specifically, like most people who will vote on Nov 3 the three term Republican senator and his Democratic challenger are closer to the center than to either extreme.
"I do not think they are as different as they say," said the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader who ran for the Democratic nomination to challenge D'Amato in 1992.
"Chuck has always been right of center in the Democratic Party, and D'Amato has always been, well, whatever works for him on that given day.
They are both rewriting as they go."
The flood of conflicting vote citations and ideological name calling that have filled the state's airwaves notwithstanding, these first three weeks of the general election campaign have been less about ideology and more about tactics.
With a nod to the political reality of the moderate cast of New York's electorate, D'Amato and Schumer are each trying to accomplish the same thing, if from different corners of the ring: to cover the tracks of their own political evolution while portraying their opponent as extreme.
This maneuvering began on the first day of the general election campaign as D'Amato attacked Schumer as liberal while the representative assailed D'Amato as soft on crime.
And it has continued every day since then, testimony to one of the most enduring facts of this contest: Whatever their differences on issues, as political tacticians, Schumer and D'Amato have similar reflexes.
This is nothing new for D'Amato.
He has historically prepared for each election with a march on the political center, and then campaigned by portraying his opponents, notably Robert Abrams, the state attorney general, in 1992, as liberal vestiges.
This formula, combined with a record of tending to the more parochial needs of the state and its voters, largely accounts for D'Amato's repeated success at winning re election in what is, by registration, a strongly Democratic state.
What is different this time is that D'Amato has encountered in Schumer a challenger who is trying to do to the senator what the senator typically does to his opponent.
The representative has parried each ideological assault by D'Amato by asserting that it is the senator who is the ideological extremist, and then by blurring his own ideological evolution with a recitation of what was his own march on the political center as he prepared in Congress for this race.
It seems unlikely that Schumer will ever convince voters that he is, for example, tougher on crime than D'Amato, or that D'Amato is a foot soldier for Gingrich's Republican revolution.
But at the very least, by echoing D'Amato's tactics, Schumer may succeed in neutralizing a weapon that D'Amato has used against previous opponents to devastating effect.
D'Amato certainly has a basis for saying that Schumer is to the left of most of the U.S. electorate.
Schumer voted against the 1996 bill that restricted welfare benefits.
He opposed the balanced budget amendment.
He has supported a series of tax increases over the years.
He voted for federal legislation that would ban discrimination in hiring homosexuals.
He has voted against measures that would make it easier to jail juveniles in adult prisons, and against another measure that would have imposed additional penalties for crimes involving the use of guns.
But Schumer, who has spent many of his 18 years in Congress preparing for the seven weeks of this general election campaign, has also repeatedly voted in favor of a federal death penalty.
(Though Schumer earlier in his life opposed the death penalty.)
He was the sponsor of legislation to provide funds to hire police officers and to ban many forms of assault weapons.
He voted to restrict the rights of illegal immigrants in some cases, and in favor of legislation to crack down on food stamp fraud.
He supported the line item veto.
He also voted in favor of a measure that would ban the recognition of marriages between homosexuals.
Similarly, on many levels, D'Amato's Republican credentials seem more than secure.
He has opposed abortion rights throughout his career, and voted against gun control.
He has supported many aspects of Gingrich's attempts to cut social spending, and his votes on environmental legislation have earned him consistently weak ratings from national environmental groups.
Yet D'Amato is no less nimble than Schumer.
The senator voted for the federal legislation that would ban discrimination in hiring against homosexuals, he is poised to win the endorsement of one of the nation's major gay rights groups, the Human Rights Campaign.
He became one of the chief advocates in Washington of repealing legislation passed by a Republican Congress (with his support) that curbed benefits to the children of illegal immigrants.
On Sunday, he spoke before one of the largest black congregations in New York City at the church in Queens led by a former congressman, the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, where he recounted his efforts to push through a commemorative coin for Jackie Robinson.
He is planning to testify in Washington on Tuesday about ways to curb acid rain.
And he has pushed consistently and successfully for spending on breast cancer research and screening.
As a matter of politics, the efforts by these two candidates suggests how complicated it is becoming to run a statewide race in New York.
The shifting ideology of the electorate, combined with the diminishing vote out of New York City in state elections, means that being viewed as a liberal is no longer the electoral lift that it once was.
Yet New York remains a long way from being a conservative state.
In the end, the best evidence of where these two candidates stand could be found in the endorsement by Schumer last week by District Council 37, the umbrella group of unions representing New York City employees.
What was surprising was not that this historically solid Democratic union endorsed Schumer but that it anguished so much over it all.
"There are differences between them," said Norman Adler, the political consultant who works for Republicans and Democrats.
"But on the whole, they are less different than you would like to think."
WASHINGTON For all the talk of duty and Constitution, it was not all that difficult for the House to open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Clinton Thursday.
The more troublesome question is how Congress will bring to a conclusion the process that Rep Henry Hyde, R Ill., called "this venture, this excursion, this journey."
The conventional wisdom, which Democrats have clung to across these tumultuous weeks for their party, is that the less impulsive Senate will never accumulate the votes to convict Clinton, and that inescapable fact will finally force some kind of a deal between the president and the Republicans.
"The president is going to remain in office," pronounced Rep James Moran, D Va. "That's a foregone conclusion."
But conventional wisdom has often been wrong in this strange political year dominated by Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, and intense causes sometimes take on a life and momentum of their own on Capitol Hill.
Many House members including some Republicans fear that having opened Pandora's box Thursday, they will never get it closed again without first moving through impeachment of the president and a Senate trial that could consume Congress for another year.
"It feels like it's out of control," said Rep Christopher Shays, R Conn. "Everything's set in motion, and I don't know how you put it back in the box."
This sense of riding a runaway train could diminish if after months of deliberations and gathering evidence, the Congress and the country jointly come to a national conclusion that Clinton should be impeached, tried and removed from office, like the consensus that Richard Nixon faced when he resigned.
The risk is that Congress could rush ahead without brakes even as the American people continue to resist the idea that Clinton should be ousted over the Lewinsky affair.
"This has the potential to be the most divisive issue in American public life since the Vietnam War," said Rep Jerrold Nadler, D N.Y. Two sharply different schools of thought co exist on Capitol Hill about how the president's fate will be determined.
Which one prevails could well be decided by the outcome of the elections just three and a half weeks away, unless Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, changes all the political calculations by forwarding to Congress new allegations of impeachable offenses.
Under the first outcome, the Republicans make only modest gains in November.
They decide they have wrung maximum political advantage out of Clinton's misconduct and that prolonged impeachment hearings could hurt them going into the 2000 presidential elections.
And for a brief window of time, the pressure to appease the party's conservative base would be off.
"I would say now that if nothing more comes out and there is no dramatic changes of seats in the House and the Senate, this will be resolved short of impeachment," said Rep Peter King, R N.Y. "If the elections stalemate, that will be a signal from the American people not to do impeachment, but to do something."
The alternate script could play out if the Republicans make strong inroads in November.
Many Republicans have already signaled their deep belief that Clinton has committed perjury, obstructed justice, and placed himself above the laws that he has sworn to uphold.
One of their loudest voices, that of the House majority whip, accused Democrats Thursday of seeking "the path of least resistance.
This is when we pitch the law overboard when the mood fits," said Rep Tom DeLay, R Texas, "when we ignore the facts in order to cover up the truth."
For such Republicans an election sweep would be read as a strong mandate to move forward with actual impeachment.
And it could cause Democratic unity to crack, putting the president in even more jeopardy.
Still, Democrats on Thursday were adamant that their few defections on the inquiry vote mean that they are likely to stand united against actual impeachment.
"If Republicans are only able to pick off 15 percent of our members on a procedural vote three weeks before an election, how many votes are they likely to get four months from now on articles of impeachment?" asked one Democratic strategist.
For now, the inquiry is likely to go on hold until after the elections.
Hyde said no hearings would be convened until later in November.
But battles are already brewing between the two parties over how to conduct the investigation.
Hyde has said he sees little reason to bring Ms Lewinsky forward in public hearings, but the Democrats are likely to demand her appearance, adding to the sense of circus on Capitol Hill.
"You cannot have impeachment hearings where the star witness is not called and cross examined," said Rep Martin Meehan, D Mass. "You have to have Monica Lewinsky testify.
You have to have her mother testify.
You have to hear from Betty Currie and Vernon Jordan."
And Rep John Conyers, D Mich., the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said Thursday that Starr would be someone the Democrats would want in the witness chair.
As these events move forward, Clinton's aides would dearly love to find a way to strike a deal on some punishment short of impeachment not in the Senate but before the House takes the actual impeachment vote, according to a Democratic strategist close to the White House.
Clinton, who has thought so often about his legacy, is now fighting not to become the only other president besides Andrew Johnson to be impeached by the House.
(Nixon resigned after the House Judiciary Committee reported out three articles of impeachment and before a House vote.)
Gingrich is the figure in the House who would have the stature to broker a deal, and just like Clinton, the speaker has an intense interest in how he is perceived in history.
But it is far from clear whether the Georgia Republican who presided from the speaker's chair through the entire House debate would have any interest in such a role.
He has his own personal considerations to weigh.
He will be standing for re election as speaker when the new Congress convenes.
His relations with Clinton have ranged from furious to occasional moments of alliance, while his relations with House Democrats have ranged from poor to awful.
In a rare bipartisan leadership meeting over impeachment last month, he lectured House Democrats that he would be fairer to Clinton than Democrats were to Gingrich when his ethics troubles resulted in a House reprimand and a $300000 fine.
Still, one House Republican with a good antenna for the speaker's intentions said that should the politics and timing be right, "I think he will try to broker a deal.
He could come in at just the right moment and show he's above it all."
But Rich Galen, a close associate of Gingrich's, said that if the evidence shows that Clinton committed perjury under oath, "I don't think the speaker will think it's his role to get in the way of that process."
Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato and Rep Charles Schumer are locked in an extraordinarily tight race for the U.S. Senate.
The outcome apparently rests with a small group of undecided voters, many of whom are not yet paying attention to the contest, a statewide New York Times/CBS News Poll has found.
With a month to go until the election, the poll found a large number of respondents 60 percent either had no opinion about Schumer, or did not know enough about him to offer an opinion.
At the same time, a sizable number of voters continue to voice reservations about D'Amato's ethics and ideology, including many undecided voters and some respondents who identified themselves as the senator's supporters.
The findings suggest two dynamics that will shape the New York contest in its final weeks: a struggle by both camps to define Schumer's public personality among voters who do not know him, and an attempt by Schumer to exploit the obvious and strong liabilities D'Amato carries as a three term Republican senator in New York.
In some ways, this closely watched contest is shaping up as a replay of the 1992 Senate race, when D'Amato ran against Robert Abrams, the former state attorney general.
A Times poll in the third week of October 1992 found D'Amato in an effective tie with his Democratic challenger.
D'Amato ultimately defeated Abrams by a single percentage point after a searing campaign.
But this latest Times/CBS News poll points to a number of ways in which this contest is different from 1992, and that is not necessarily good news for D'Amato.
An equal number of voters now view D'Amato and Schumer as being serious when it comes to dealing with crime, evidence that the nine term Brooklyn congressman has achieved some success in neutralizing a traditionally Republican issue.
While D'Amato continues to be widely viewed as "the kind of person who gets things done for the voters" clearly one of his biggest political advantages going into the last couple of months a substantial number of respondents said he was lacking in honesty and integrity, and that he did not care "about the needs and problems of people like you."
Schumer scored strongly on both measures.
And perhaps most strikingly, D'Amato's intense effort to derail Schumer's campaign with a series of attacks these past three weeks from portraying him as a liberal to spotlighting votes he has missed in Washington as he campaigned in New York this year has yet to show obvious effect on the public's view of the congressman.
Only 18 percent of respondents had an unfavorable rating of Schumer, compared to 22 percent who had a favorable rating.
By contrast, in a poll conducted in the third week of October of 1992, Abrams was viewed unfavorably by one in three voters.
In the current poll, D'Amato is viewed favorably by 27 percent and unfavorably by 36 percent, virtually the same marks he received six years ago.
By almost every measure that pollsters use to try to analyze an election registered voters, likely voters, and taking into account how undecided New Yorkers might be leaning toward this contest is a dead heat.
Among registered voters, Schumer is supported by 44 percent, compared to 41 percent for D'Amato.
There were 12 percent undecided.
Among those respondents considered most likely to vote, based on their past behavior and current level of interest in the contest, the margin is 47 percent for Schumer to 43 percent for D'Amato.
The Times/CBS News statewide telephone poll was conducted from last Thursday through Tuesday with 1461 adults, of whom 1066 said they were registered to vote.
It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three points.
Therefore, among registered voters, Schumer could be ahead by as much as nine points or D'Amato could be ahead by three points.
CHICAGO She says he is "duplicitous," a "wolf in sheep's clothing" who has resorted to "scuzzball" campaign tactics in the past.
He has described her as "shrill," claims she "has nothing positive to say about her own record" and that her career has been "obscured by numerous scandals and controversies."
The U.S. Senate race between the incumbent Democrat, Carol Moseley Braun, and state Sen Peter Fitzgerald, a conservative Republican, has become one of the most tensely watched campaigns in the country.
And with less than a month to go, the candidates have dropped all pretense of keeping the gloves on.
The latest poll, published last week in The Chicago Tribune, suggests that Ms Moseley Braun, elected in 1992 as a radiantly rising star, is in serious election trouble.
She lagged behind Fitzgerald by 10 percentage points, with more voters saying they believed Fitzgerald was the more honest and trustworthy candidate.
The poll, which had a margin of error of 3 percentage points, also suggested that she has lost considerable support among suburban women, one of the main groups that swept her into office six years ago in what became known as the "Year of the Woman."
Dogged by a series of missteps and poor judgments in her personal and political life, Ms Moseley Braun, 51, who was catapulted from an obscure Cook County office to become the nation's first black female senator, has had trouble getting voters to focus on her legislative accomplishments.
And she has been soundly outspent by Fitzgerald, a 37 year old multimillionaire from the Chicago suburbs who inherited his family banking fortune and spent $7 million of his own money on the Republican primary alone.
"Have I not handled my own publicity and image making as well as I could have?"
Ms Moseley Braun said in an interview.
"There's no question about that.
Have I not handled the politics as well as I could have?
No question.
But I certainly have worked as hard as I can.
I've got a great legislative record.
And with all the things that have been thrown at me, none of them has stuck."
Fitzgerald, considered so conservative that most Republican leaders supported his moderate opponent in the bitterly contested primary, has wasted no opportunity to try to make Ms Moseley Braun's mistakes stick and to deflect her characterization of him as an extremist by painting her as an ineffectual liberal.
"Although her career has been somewhat obscured by numerous scandals and controversies, those who have noticed her voting record have noticed it is very extreme," Fitzgerald said in an interview.
Across the board, these are tough times for Illinois Democrats.
In the hotly contested race to replace Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican who is retiring, Glenn Poshard, a Democratic congressman from downstate Illinois, trailed George Ryan, the Republican Secretary of State, by 22 percentage points in The Tribune's poll.
Poshard has alienated liberal Democrats with his opposition to abortion rights and some gay rights issues, as well as his past votes against gun control and environmental measures.
And he has tried without much success to tar Ryan with a scandal in which employees of the secretary of state's office are accused of taking bribes in return for granting truck licenses, and using some of the bribe money to support Ryan and other candidates.
Democrats running for other offices, even those in heavily Democratic Cook County, are running into trouble, too.
This year, the state legislature eliminated straight party voting in Illinois, long considered a boon to Democrats.
And although Democrats are hoping that the efforts of congressional Republicans to impeach President Clinton may spur Democrats to the polls in a kind of backlash, so far the president's problems have not helped matters and could lower turnout among Democratic voters.
( Poshard even stayed away from a Chicago fund raiser on his behalf which Clinton attended).
All of that is making things harder for Ms Moseley Braun in a race that has her looking more like a challenger than an incumbent.
"I've always thought she was going to be in a tough race, even against Fitzgerald, but I didn't think it was going to be this tough," said Dawn Clark Netsch, a Democrat who ran for governor in The senator had to press hard to get Fitzgerald to agree to a debate, which was held on Sunday.
After it was over, she said she had not expected him to try to "paint himself as a centrist" and said, "I could have made him show his true colors better."
Fitzgerald, for his part, said the senator sounded "shrill" in the debate and that she "wasn't even able to understand what I was talking about when I was talking about Social Security."
Democrats had hoped Fitzgerald would win the primary because they believed his conservative views would make him easier to defeat.
Fitzgerald, who started running for the state legislature soon after he finished law school, believes his wealth has allowed him to be more independent in his political views.
He opposes abortion, even in cases of rape or incest, sponsored a bill signed into law by Edgar that bans same sex marriages and would screen gay people out of the military.
He would use the federal budget surplus to provide tax cuts, while Ms Moseley Braun would use it to shore up Social Security.
Ms Moseley Braun, who sits on the Senate Finance Committee, has concentrated on cleaning up polluted industrial sites in cities, fixing decrepit school buildings, improving pension laws for women and fighting for tax breaks on airline tickets and ethanol, issues important in Illinois.
But from the start, she has also had to fend off accusations that she misused an inheritance instead of reimbursing Medicaid for her mother's care, ignored accusations of sexual harassment against her 1992 campaign manager and former fiance, Kgosie Matthews, and that she and Matthews spent tens of thousands of campaign dollars on personal travel, clothes, jewelry and stereo equipment.
Although no investigation found any criminal wrongdoing and Ms Moseley Braun has acknowledged making mistakes in judgment, she has not been able to shake what she calls her "negatives."
A few weeks ago, when George Will raised these issues in his column, the senator lost her temper, used a racial slur to portray herself as a victim of racism and compared Will to a member of the Ku Klux Klan, forcing her to apologize.
"She knows that she's in a dogfight.
Most incumbents don't want to debate," said Paul Green, a professor of political science at Governors State University in Chicago.
In the remaining weeks of the campaign, Ms Moseley Braun, a charismatic campaigner, said she will work hard to reach disaffected supporters.
Her campaign has raised about $6 million (compared to the $10 million Fitzgerald has already spent) and has scheduled fund raisers with Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago, Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
"I've worked myself already into bad health," said Ms Moseley Braun, who was treated last week for bronchial pneumonia at a Texas hospital after she fell ill on a flight to Dallas.
"I'm doing everything I know how."

On Sunday, he spoke before one of the largest black congregations in New York City at the church in Queens led by a former congressman, the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, where he recounted his efforts to push through a commemorative coin for Jackie Robinson.
He is planning to testify in Washington on Tuesday about ways to curb acid rain.
And he has pushed consistently and successfully for spending on breast cancer research and screening.
As a matter of politics, the efforts by these two candidates suggests how complicated it is becoming to run a statewide race in New York.
The shifting ideology of the electorate, combined with the diminishing vote out of New York City in state elections, means that being viewed as a liberal is no longer the electoral lift that it once was.
Yet New York remains a long way from being a conservative state.
In the end, the best evidence of where these two candidates stand could be found in the endorsement by Schumer last week by District Council 37, the umbrella group of unions representing New York City employees.
What was surprising was not that this historically solid Democratic union endorsed Schumer but that it anguished so much over it all.
"There are differences between them," said Norman Adler, the political consultant who works for Republicans and Democrats.
"But on the whole, they are less different than you would like to think."
CHICAGO She says he is "duplicitous," a "wolf in sheep's clothing" who has resorted to "scuzzball" campaign tactics in the past.
He has described her as "shrill," claims she "has nothing positive to say about her own record" and that her career has been "obscured by numerous scandals and controversies."
The U.S. Senate race between the incumbent Democrat, Carol Moseley Braun, and state Sen Peter Fitzgerald, a conservative Republican, has become one of the most tensely watched campaigns in the country.
And with less than a month to go, the candidates have dropped all pretense of keeping the gloves on.
The latest poll, published last week in The Chicago Tribune, suggests that Ms Moseley Braun, elected in 1992 as a radiantly rising star, is in serious election trouble.
She lagged behind Fitzgerald by 10 percentage points, with more voters saying they believed Fitzgerald was the more honest and trustworthy candidate.
The poll, which had a margin of error of 3 percentage points, also suggested that she has lost considerable support among suburban women, one of the main groups that swept her into office six years ago in what became known as the "Year of the Woman."
Dogged by a series of missteps and poor judgments in her personal and political life, Ms Moseley Braun, 51, who was catapulted from an obscure Cook County office to become the nation's first black female senator, has had trouble getting voters to focus on her legislative accomplishments.
And she has been soundly outspent by Fitzgerald, a 37 year old multimillionaire from the Chicago suburbs who inherited his family banking fortune and spent $7 million of his own money on the Republican primary alone.
"Have I not handled my own publicity and image making as well as I could have?"
Ms Moseley Braun said in an interview.
"There's no question about that.
Have I not handled the politics as well as I could have?
No question.
But I certainly have worked as hard as I can.
I've got a great legislative record.
And with all the things that have been thrown at me, none of them has stuck."
Fitzgerald, considered so conservative that most Republican leaders supported his moderate opponent in the bitterly contested primary, has wasted no opportunity to try to make Ms Moseley Braun's mistakes stick and to deflect her characterization of him as an extremist by painting her as an ineffectual liberal.
"Although her career has been somewhat obscured by numerous scandals and controversies, those who have noticed her voting record have noticed it is very extreme," Fitzgerald said in an interview.
Across the board, these are tough times for Illinois Democrats.
In the hotly contested race to replace Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican who is retiring, Glenn Poshard, a Democratic congressman from downstate Illinois, trailed George Ryan, the Republican Secretary of State, by 22 percentage points in The Tribune's poll.
Poshard has alienated liberal Democrats with his opposition to abortion rights and some gay rights issues, as well as his past votes against gun control and environmental measures.
And he has tried without much success to tar Ryan with a scandal in which employees of the secretary of state's office are accused of taking bribes in return for granting truck licenses, and using some of the bribe money to support Ryan and other candidates.
Democrats running for other offices, even those in heavily Democratic Cook County, are running into trouble, too.
This year, the state legislature eliminated straight party voting in Illinois, long considered a boon to Democrats.
And although Democrats are hoping that the efforts of congressional Republicans to impeach President Clinton may spur Democrats to the polls in a kind of backlash, so far the president's problems have not helped matters and could lower turnout among Democratic voters.
( Poshard even stayed away from a Chicago fund raiser on his behalf which Clinton attended).
All of that is making things harder for Ms Moseley Braun in a race that has her looking more like a challenger than an incumbent.
"I've always thought she was going to be in a tough race, even against Fitzgerald, but I didn't think it was going to be this tough," said Dawn Clark Netsch, a Democrat who ran for governor in The senator had to press hard to get Fitzgerald to agree to a debate, which was held on Sunday.
After it was over, she said she had not expected him to try to "paint himself as a centrist" and said, "I could have made him show his true colors better."
Fitzgerald, for his part, said the senator sounded "shrill" in the debate and that she "wasn't even able to understand what I was talking about when I was talking about Social Security."
Democrats had hoped Fitzgerald would win the primary because they believed his conservative views would make him easier to defeat.
Fitzgerald, who started running for the state legislature soon after he finished law school, believes his wealth has allowed him to be more independent in his political views.
He opposes abortion, even in cases of rape or incest, sponsored a bill signed into law by Edgar that bans same sex marriages and would screen gay people out of the military.
He would use the federal budget surplus to provide tax cuts, while Ms Moseley Braun would use it to shore up Social Security.
Ms Moseley Braun, who sits on the Senate Finance Committee, has concentrated on cleaning up polluted industrial sites in cities, fixing decrepit school buildings, improving pension laws for women and fighting for tax breaks on airline tickets and ethanol, issues important in Illinois.
But from the start, she has also had to fend off accusations that she misused an inheritance instead of reimbursing Medicaid for her mother's care, ignored accusations of sexual harassment against her 1992 campaign manager and former fiance, Kgosie Matthews, and that she and Matthews spent tens of thousands of campaign dollars on personal travel, clothes, jewelry and stereo equipment.
Although no investigation found any criminal wrongdoing and Ms Moseley Braun has acknowledged making mistakes in judgment, she has not been able to shake what she calls her "negatives."
A few weeks ago, when George Will raised these issues in his column, the senator lost her temper, used a racial slur to portray herself as a victim of racism and compared Will to a member of the Ku Klux Klan, forcing her to apologize.
"She knows that she's in a dogfight.
Most incumbents don't want to debate," said Paul Green, a professor of political science at Governors State University in Chicago.
In the remaining weeks of the campaign, Ms Moseley Braun, a charismatic campaigner, said she will work hard to reach disaffected supporters.
Her campaign has raised about $6 million (compared to the $10 million Fitzgerald has already spent) and has scheduled fund raisers with Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago, Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
"I've worked myself already into bad health," said Ms Moseley Braun, who was treated last week for bronchial pneumonia at a Texas hospital after she fell ill on a flight to Dallas.
"I'm doing everything I know how."
WASHINGTON Almost every member of the House Judiciary Committee paid some tribute to the Constitution and the Founding Fathers Monday.
Many said portentously that their debates and votes would be remembered for generations.
The muse of history was obviously working overtime.
True, it was only the third time that presidential impeachment has been formally considered on Capitol Hill.
But only in that limited sense was the approval of a full scale impeachment process historic.
It was by no means decisive, no matter how much the legislators huffed and puffed.
This was only a first step along a rocky road whose length is not known not by President Clinton, not by the public and not even by committee members (although the chairman, Rep Henry J. Hyde, R Ill., said last weekend that he hoped the House of Representatives could finish its work before year's end).
"The Constitution provides our compass," said Rep Edward Pease, R Ind. "I intend to follow it."
But neither he nor his colleagues could say for sure where it would ultimately point.
Meeting in the same room where Richard Nixon's fate was sealed a quarter century ago, Republicans stressed parallels to that era.
This case is about law breaking, they said, and not about illicit sex.
To which Rep John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the committee's senior Democrat, retorted: "This is not about Watergate.
It is about an extramarital affair."
That is the fault line, so far unbridgeable, between the two parties.
People in Washington universally assume that the House as a whole will vote later this week to ratify the committee's decision.
The Republicans have the votes to prevail.
But if only Republicans support the procedural plans set out by their leadership, as was the case in the final vote Monday night, the decision will be seen by many in the country as a purely partisan proposition.
That next roll call will help set the tone for what lies ahead.
If only a half dozen Democrats join the Republicans, the image of trench warfare will be reinforced and the subsequent inquiry will begin under something of a cloud, if 50 or 75 do so, the vote will confer a greater degree of legitimacy.
The more the average voter thinks that the Republicans are ganging up on the president, his strategists believe, the better his chances of surviving.
Of course, consensus or something approaching it may develop later.
Only well into the final stages of the committee's 1974 hearings on the impeachment of Nixon did significant numbers of Republican members join the Democrats in concluding that Nixon had committed impeachable offenses.
The fact that they finally did led people on both sides to judge its actions fair.
In the other case of presidential impeachment, Andrew Johnson survived a Senate trial because just enough members of the opposition party broke ranks and voted to back him.
Once this week's votes have been taken, attention will shift to the midterm elections on Nov 3.
The conventional wisdom in Washington has shifted rapidly in recent days, from a belief in the days before the release of Kenneth Starr's report that changes would be minimal, especially in the House, to a suspicion that Democratic losses would be large, which took hold in the days before the tape of Clinton's grand jury testimony was released.
Now there is a growing conviction that the Republicans erred by releasing the tape, creating a backlash that could help marginal House Democrats.
Two caveats seem in order, however.
While the president's troubles seem less likely to influence Senate races, Democrats were in big trouble in those without any drag from Washington.
A number of independent analysts see Republican gains of four to six seats.
Major losses in the House are still possible, too, perhaps 20 or more seats if Republican voters turn out en masse and Democrats do not.
"Differential turnouts aren't really very common, you know," said a senior Republican senator on Capitol Hill.
"But this year, Democratic voters seem to be in a sulk, and the Republicans act like they'd turn out even if it snowed on Election Day."
Big gains might embolden Republican legislators in their pursuit of Clinton.
But the political terrain is tricky.
After November, both parties will have to play to the 2000 electorate larger, spread more broadly across the economic scale, and less intensely partisan and that might have a tempering effect on the zeal of the Republicans in Congress.
The detailed terms of the case developed by the inquiry, and how it is developed, will have an impact as well.
Unshakeable as the preconceptions of many committee members sounded Monday, experience suggests that over a long period, some of them and some others in the House will change their minds.
If Clinton and Monica Lewinsky are called as witnesses, their deportment will certainly influence some representatives.
How they and their interrogators behave will influence voters as well.
Clinton is a formidable persuader, and any attempt to break down his testimony would run the risk of alienating people who would sense disrespect for the presidency.
A foreign crisis a genuine foreign crisis, as opposed to one that the administration was suspected of inventing could radically change the context of the inquiry, too.
Republicans might find themselves under fire for distracting the commander in chief from important security responsibilities.
And what of the topics other than Ms Lewinsky that Starr has investigated?
Hyde insisted Monday night that the independent counsel was still pursuing the original Whitewater matter and other controversies, one of the committee's ranking Democrats, Rep Barney Frank of Massachusetts, insisted that no more would be forthcoming from Starr.
Ambiguity keeps the pot boiling, wrapping up the other cases would take some of the steam out of the House inquiry.
All of those ideas, all of those possibilities will be in the air as the House debates impeachment in November and December.
Depending on how they coalesce, the Republican leadership might or might not be receptive to a compromise, either before a committee vote or after a committee vote to approve articles of impeachment, before ratification by the House as a whole.
At any time, of course, Clinton could change his mind and decide to resign.
Nixon's decision to quit came after the committee had voted.
But it was motivated by the emergence of new evidence more than the vote itself, plus the belief he could not win in the Senate.
Clinton's aides say he would rather be a second Andrew Johnson, surviving in the Senate by a tiny margin, than a second Richard Nixon.
As things now stand, he would appear to have a good chance of getting the 34 votes he would need (one third of the total plus one) to win a Senate trial.
But that is not chiseled in stone, either.
The Republicans could have 60 seats by the time the case reached the Senate.
In that case, if they lost none of their own partisans, a switch of only seven Democrats would doom Clinton.
A remote possibility, certainly, but then so much of what has happened so far in this case seemed highly improbable until it happened.
LOS ANGELES In 1992, in a good year for Democrats, Barbara Boxer won her seat in the U.S. Senate with 48 percent of the vote.
In the six years since, she has been a reliably outspoken liberal from a state that is less so, and has never managed to lift her job approval ratings above 50 percent.
Now, in what is shaping up as a bad year for Democrats, Ms Boxer is struggling to hold her own against a comparative neophyte, the Republican state treasurer, Matt Fong.
Their contest has become one of a handful of closely watched races that will determine whether the Republicans can win a filibuster proof 60 seat majority that could shape the congressional landscape for years.
As the House of Representatives prepares to debate whether to open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky matter, much attention has focused on the plight of House Democrats in swing districts.
But from California to Wisconsin, from Illinois to Nevada, from Kentucky to South Carolina, Senate seats now held by Democrats are also in jeopardy, raising the possibility of the biggest Republican majority in the Senate since the administration of Warren G. Harding in 1921 23, when the party held 59 seats in a 96 member body.
"It's just that the Republicans have more opportunities, and better opportunities," said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of a respected independent political newsletter in Washington.
"The Democrats are definitely still on the defensive, and it shows."
Although Clinton's own job approval ratings jumped to near his highest ever after the release of his videotaped grand jury testimony last month, that support has generally not carried over to Democratic incumbents around the country, some of whom, like Boxer and Sen Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, were vulnerable long before Clinton's current troubles ever surfaced.
In the Senate alone, Democrats have lost 11 seats since Clinton's 1992 victory, and Republicans hold a 55 45 majority.
"Publicly, the congressional Democrats defend the president a bit," said Ross Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University and a leading expert on the Senate.
"But privately, they're angry and worried and scared.
"It's a case of the ship leaving the sinking rats."
One senior Democratic senator, now in his fourth term, summed up the situation this way, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
"When I came here, there were 64 Democratic senators," the senator said.
"Now we'll be lucky to get 42."
With its magisterial pace, rarefied folkways and six year election cycles, the Senate has always been less subject to the vicissitudes of voter sentiment than the House, whose entire membership faces re election every two years.
But when changes in the Senate do occur, experience has shown that they can be big changes.
In years like 1980, for example, when the Republicans took a majority as Ronald Reagan was elected president, or 1986, when the party lost control of the Senate (and lost more seats there than it did in the House), or 1994, when the Democrats lost control of both houses after the failure of Clinton's proposed health care overhaul, "all the close races went one way," Rothenberg said.
If Republicans win all the close Senate races where they are now thought to be in striking distance, experts say they could well make the net gain of five seats needed to reach 60, the number of votes needed to cut off floor debate and block a Democratic filibuster.
"I think there's about a 30 percent chance of that happening," said Jennifer E. Duffy, the Senate editor of the Cook Political Report, another highly regarded nonpartisan newsletter in Washington.
"A gain of three seats is the worst they'll do."
Of the 34 Senate seats up this year, 10 are considered safely Republican and 9 safely Democratic.
The Ohio seat being vacated by John Glenn, a Democrat who is retiring, is considered a likely bet for Gov. George Voinovich, a Republican, while the Republican seat in Indiana being surrendered by Dan Coats is likely to be won by former Gov. Evan Bayh, a Democrat seeking to reclaim the office once held by his father, Birch.
That means Republicans would have to hold onto all 5 of the remaining seats the party now holds, from New York, North Carolina, Missouri, Colorado and Georgia, and pick up 6 of the remaining 8 Democratic held seats to achieve the net gain of 5 seats needed to reach 60.
Their best bets are Illinois, California, Kentucky, Nevada, Wisconsin, Washington state and South Carolina.
Democratic senators are in trouble for a range of reasons, from changing voter demographics, which have left incumbents like Harry Reid of Nevada and Ernest Hollings of South Carolina facing electorates decidedly more Republican than the ones that chose them to begin with, to the failure of some senators, like Boxer and Moseley Braun, to solidify their original base of support.
Moseley Braun, like Boxer a member of the 1992 "Year of the Woman" class and the first black woman ever elected to the Senate, is running 10 points behind her Republican challenger, state Sen Peter Fitzgerald, in the latest polls, and national Democratic officials seem to have all but conceded the seat.
In Washington state, another member of the 1992 class, Patty Murray, holds only a slight lead over her Republican challenger, Rep Linda Smith.
In Wisconsin, Russell Feingold, the Democratic co sponsor of the campaign finance reform bill that bears his name, is testing that proposition in his own race, eschewing "soft money" contributions from his national party.
He recently let his opponent, Rep Mark Neumann, broadcast a heavy dose of unanswered television commercials.
Ms Duffy of the Cook Report moved that race into the toss up category last week.
The Kentucky seat being vacated by Sen Wendell Ford, a Democrat, appears to be a tossup between Representative Scotty Baesler, a Democrat, and Jim Bunning, a Republican, with the most recent independent poll showing a virtual dead heat.
Boxer's situation is fairly typical, with some problems of her own making and others exacerbated by Clinton, to whom she is related by marriage.
Her daughter, Nicole, is married to Tony Rodham, Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, and the senator took some heat for her initially low key comments about the Lewinsky scandal, especially given her past outspoken opposition to Sen Bob Packwood and Judge Clarence Thomas over allegations of sexual harassment against them.
After Clinton's Aug 17 admission of an "inappropriate" relationship with Ms Lewinsky, Ms Boxer eventually condemned his behavior in strong terms on the Senate floor, but not until well after her California colleague, Dianne Feinstein, had issued her own stinging rebuke of Clinton.
But Fong, who was elected state treasurer just four years ago and whose inexperience on the stump showed in his first debate with Boxer this summer, is hardly a powerhouse candidate.
Boxer has held roughly a 2 to 1 fund raising advantage over him throughout the year, and he barely eked out a victory in the Republican primary in June against Darrel Issa, a millionaire businessman.
"If Barbara Boxer were all that strong politically, she'd be way ahead of Matt Fong," Rothenberg said.
"She would have put him away long ago."
Instead, recent polls have shown the candidates in either a dead heat, or Fong slightly ahead among likely voters, though a Democratic operative not affiliated with either campaign said that recent private Democratic polls had shown Ms Boxer opening a single digit lead.
Fong began his television advertising campaign last week, with ads in English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Spanish touting his support for education and aimed at making inroads among minority voters whom Republicans often overlook, though only the English language version stresses the necessity for children to "read, write and speak English so they are prepared to get a job."
By contrast, Boxer has been on the air for about three weeks, most recently with a 30 second commercial, narrated by actor Martin Sheen, that denounces Fong as "the gun lobby's favorite candidate" and touts her support for new bans on assault weapons and cheap handguns.
Unlike Feinstein, Boxer has largely failed to move beyond her liberal base and establish a strong anti crime reputation.
In that regard, Boxer's first ad was perhaps even more revealing.
Broadcast in her home turf of San Francisco and featuring footage from old family home movies, it was a soft edged hymn to her support for children, in the form of after school programs to keep them "out of gangs, and criminal background checks for child care workers."
"It's all about her losing a lot of her base from '92 and having to get it back," said Ms Duffy of the Cook Report.
"This was for the soccer moms she should already have."
The national Republican Senatorial Committee is closely watching California as a promising contest, along with Nevada, Wisconsin and a handful of others, said a spokesman for the committee, Mike Russell.
He declined to speculate about how much the party might spend to help Fong make his case, but acknowledged that "it's certainly a race where those kinds of resources could make a difference."
"In Boxer, you have a candidate who is stuck at 45 percent or below, and has no real room to grow, since most people in the state already know her and have fixed opinions of her," Russell said.
"Matt is not only a sharp candidate, but as an Asian American can chew into her base."
Even if the Republicans could win control of 60 seats, that would be far from the most lopsided margin in Senate history.
After the election of 1936, at the height of the New Deal, the Democrats held 75 seats, to 17 for the Republicans and the remaining split among minor parties.
And after Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 landslide, the Democrats had 68 seats to 32 for the Republicans.
Moreover, Baker of Rutgers noted, maverick Republicans like Sens Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, James Jeffords of Vermont and John Chafee of Rhode Island so regularly break ranks that even 60 Republican seats would not be enough to guarantee an ironclad defense against a Democratic filibuster.
"It's such an individualistic institution," he said.
"It's such a place of personalities and individuals, and there's a real aversion on the part of senators to appear to be part of a herd, or part of an unshakable bloc of votes."
BUFFALO, N.Y. With federal marshals posted outside and protesters waving pictures of aborted fetuses from the sidewalk, the clinic where Dr Barnett A. Slepian performed abortions until he was slain on Friday night reopened here Tuesday and its director vowed to continue his work.
Short staffed even before Slepian was fatally shot by a sniper who hid in a wooded field behind his home, the clinic, Buffalo Women's Gynecological Services, scrambled to find doctors to cover his schedule.
But the clinic performed no abortions Tuesday and saw only a few patients, said the director, Marilynn Buckham.
Instead, she said, the staff spent the day mourning.
"We needed to talk about the loss of our friend," she said after a series of staff meetings.
"We discussed how badly we felt."
In a brief and tearful interview in her office, Ms Buckham said she had received calls from doctors around the country who offered to perform there and said some would be flying to Buffalo as early as Wednesday.
"We will be doing abortions," she said.
The sniper attack that killed Slepian left many women here, most of them poor or working class, expressing outrage that a bullet had deprived them at least temporarily of one of the few options they had to end an unwanted or unhealthy pregnancy.
The clinic is the only one left in Buffalo, New York State's second largest city, that specializes in abortions.
The anger could be seen in people like Karen Jones, 25, who dropped off a friend at the clinic Tuesday morning, only to be swarmed by anti abortion protesters who screamed, "Be strong!" and "Save the baby!"
"It's none of their business if someone wants to have an abortion," she said, nervously taking a drag from a cigarette as she sat in her car, awaiting her friend.
"Are they going to be around to help raise the baby?
No they won't.
This decision is between a woman and her God."
As the staff at the clinic scheduled appointments for the rest of the week one staff member said the clinic was fully booked for Thursday and Friday local and federal investigators reported little progress in their search for the sniper who shot Slepian, 52, through an undraped window as he stood in his kitchen in the nearby suburb of Amherst.
The officials were working on the theory that his killing is linked to four other sniper attacks since 1994 on doctors who perform abortions here and in Canada.
Three of the attacks took place in Canada, and one in Rochester, though no one was killed.
Tuesday, according to a friend, Lynne Slepian, the doctor's widow, was trying to spend time alone with their four young sons, talking about what had happened to their father and the consequences for their family.
"Right now, she is worried about the kids' safety and well being," said the friend, Ellen Fink.
"Yes, she is worried about how she is going to support them.
But that is tomorrow."
The federal government dispatched United States.
Marshals here Tuesday to assist clinic workers in their efforts to reopen Tuesday morning, though there was no visible protection from local law enforcement authorities.
Federal officials said that the marshals would be on hand to protect doctors who plan to arrive here from around the country to fill in for Slepian.
They gave no further details.
"We intend to provide a high level of security for the doctors and patients who come here," said one federal law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
As for the women who live in this poor end of town, Slepian's death stirred not only sadness but also practical concerns about what they will do should they or their daughters become pregnant.
Sharon Ashley, 43, recalled that teen age a friends showed up at the clinic about a year ago, only to be confronted by anti abortion protesters who convinced her to keep the baby.
In the end, she said, the young women was so unprepared to be a mother that child welfare authorities took the child away.
"They told her that they would help her," Ms Ashely said of the anti abortion protesters.
"But they didn't do anything.
They left that girl on her own.
What you had was a child trying to raise a child."
She added: "Doctor Slepian helped a lot of people.
Women around her don't have many options now.
I think what you are going to see is young girls trying to give themselves abortions.
It's like we're going back to the old days."
Nancy Roseboro, 31, remembers showing up at the clinic as a young girl to get an abortion after the man she lived with left her.
As far as she is concerned, Slepian gave her a second chance.
"If I had had that child, I'd be stuck on welfare or something," she said.
"I was a child.
I couldn't take care of my own self.
How could I take care of a child?
I think it was the best decision I could have made."
Betty Hodlen sees the issue in terms of class and race.
More affluent women, she says, can go to private doctors who will perform abortions.
But poor women like herself have had to rely on people like Slepian.
"He was a kind man, a good man," she said.
"I think a lot of people in this community feel a sense of loss.
This is an outrage.
The anti abortion people say they want to save lives, but they have also taken lives now."
AMHERST, N.Y. With no arrests reported in Friday night's slaying of Dr Barnett Slepian, the three doctors who publicly acknowledge performing abortions in the Buffalo area remained in seclusion Sunday as residents of this quiet Buffalo suburb reeled from the news that a sniper could still be in their midst.
Law enforcement officials from federal, state and local agencies who met with Canadian investigators here Sunday would not comment on their inquiry into the death of Slepian, the gynecologist and obstetrician who was killed by a sniper as he sat in his kitchen.
Abortion rights advocates said clinics in the area that perform abortions had been promised stepped up security by law enforcement officials and would operate normally this week.
Neither a spokeswoman for the FBI or federal and local police officials would specify the security measures that would be taken.
Lucinda Finnelly, the lawyer representing Buffalo GYN Womenservices, an abortion clinic where Slepian frequently worked, said that another physician who wished to remain anonymous had treated patients who had been scheduled to see Slepian on Saturday.
Other abortion advocates said that since the slaying local physicians had expressed their willingness to carry out abortions.
"Womenservices is determined to keep this going," Ms Finnelly said.
"That's what Bart would have wanted."
Many residents here who denounced the shooting refused to give their names out of fear that Slepian's killer could strike again.
There was an obvious sense of concern over the sniper attack in this picturesque suburb of 150000, which was declared the statistically safest city in America in a 1997 survey by Money magazine.
"The fact that someone could come in and do something like this is shocking," said Nick DiPirro, a retired high school administrator.
"Things like this don't happen here."
The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct 26: The murder of Dr Barnett Slepian is the latest depraved assault on the small number of courageous physicians who still risk their safety to perform legal abortions in this country.
Slepian was one of only three doctors who performed abortions in the Buffalo, N.Y., area, and harassment and threats against him by anti abortion groups had become routine over the past decade.
He persevered through courage and a belief in the right of his patients to choose whether to bear a child.
But a principled commitment to provide a constitutionally protected service could not stop the assassin's bullet that tore through his kitchen window and into his back Friday night.
His death shows again how tentative the right to abortion has become in the face of terrorism by anti choice fanatics.
Their repeated acts of terrorism must be met with the severest possible crackdown by law enforcement authorities.
If an armed police officer has to be stationed outside every abortion provider's home and office, 24 hours a day, let it be done.
This is an assault not only on individual doctors but on the rights and liberties of all Americans.
Last week the FBI joined Canadian authorities to investigate a series of unsolved sniper shootings of doctors in Canada and western New York dating to 1994.
In January, a week after the 25th anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision, a clinic bombing in Birmingham, Ala., killed a security guard and severely wounded a nurse.
Since 1993, three doctors, including Slepian, three clinic employees and a clinic escort have been murdered.
There have been more than a dozen attempted murders of abortion providers in the last five years.
Arson and bombings at clinics have become so common that many no longer make the national news.
It is bad enough that conservatives in Congress and in state legislatures are working to dismantle reproductive rights by banning certain procedures, such as so called partial birth abortion, and by requiring waiting periods and parental consent before an abortion can be obtained.
But those restrictions are at least imposed by the normal give and take of political and judicial struggle in a democracy.
What is outrageous is the attempt to shut down abortions by illegal means by shooting the doctors or bombing the clinics or harassing the women seeking to exercise their constitutional right.
Some anti abortion groups, to their credit, have denounced the bombings and shootings, but others seem reluctant to issue the strong condemnations that are warranted.
Indeed, one particularly virulent anti abortion Web site lists the names of doctors it says perform abortions, or "crimes against humanity," with a code indicating whether they are "working," "wounded" or a "fatality."
Such incendiary rhetoric, and frequent accusations by some anti abortionists that abortion providers are committing murder, can only fuel more terrorism.
The increase of anti choice laws and ongoing campaigns of harassment by protest groups, even short of murder, have worked to make abortions harder to obtain.
More than 80 percent of counties in this country have no abortion provider.
In 45 states, the number of doctors who performed abortions declined between 1982 and 1992.
Slepian was among those who took a stand against restricting reproductive freedom and paid with his life.
Unless these brave doctors are better protected, fewer doctors in the next generation will be willing to place themselves and their families in such danger.
That is what the terrorists want.
They must not be allowed to succeed.
Dr.
Barnett Slepian, an obstetrician with a practice in suburban Buffalo, N.Y., returned home from synagogue Friday night with his wife, Lynn, and greeted his four sons.
Then he stepped into his kitchen, where a sniper's bullet crashed through a back window and struck him in the chest, police said.
He fell to the floor, calling for help, but he would die within two hours.
Slepian was one of a handful of doctors who provide abortions in the Buffalo area, and law enforcement officials said Saturday that his slaying was the most deadly example of what they described as an annual pattern of anti abortion violence in Canada and western New York.
Slepian had endured years of picketing and harassment, and earlier on Friday he had received a warning about possible attacks against abortion providers.
Slepian, 51, is the third abortion doctor killed in the United States since 1993.
In the past four years, three Canadian doctors and a doctor in Rochester, N.Y., all of whom performed abortions, have been wounded by snipers.
Each of the shootings occurred within a few weeks of Nov 11, Veteran's Day, also known as Remembrance Day in Canada.
President Clinton said Saturday that he was "outraged" by Slepian's slaying and that the Justice Department was working with local authorities to track down his killer.
New York Gov. George Pataki said the killer should face the death penalty.
"It's beyond a tragedy it's really an act of terrorism and, in my mind, a cold blooded assassination," Pataki said in Buffalo.
Susan Ward, a spokeswoman for Buffalo GYN Women's Services, the private clinic where Slepian performed abortions, said the National Abortion Federation had faxed a warning to the clinic Friday morning reminding them about the four year pattern of attacks.
Ms Ward said the fax was sent to Slepian at his private office in Amherst.
"He was aware of the threat," she said.
"Around this time of year, there had been shootings."
Amherst police said the timing of the shootings was not the only similarity.
In each case, police said a gunman, using a high powered rifle, fired through a window into the home of the doctors.
Last November, a doctor in Winnipeg, Manitoba, was shot in the shoulder by a bullet fired through a window.
Assistant Police Chief Frank Olesko said local investigators as well as FBI agents and Canadian authorities were looking at the possibility that the same gunman could be responsible for all of the shootings.
A task force of several Canadian and U.S. law enforcement agencies has been investigating the attacks for more than a year.
National abortion rights advocates expressed concern that the slaying signaled a renewed escalation of violence against abortion providers.
The gunman who shot Slepian apparently hid in a strip of woods behind the house, then fired a single shot from a high powered rifle, Olesko said.
Local police, FBI agents and Canadian investigators searched the woods Saturday, but the identity and whereabouts of the suspect remained unknown.
Shalom Press, another Amherst abortion provider who had known Slepian for years, said, "He believed women had the right to have an abortion, and he followed his conscience."
The slaying comes more than six years after anti abortion protesters descended on Buffalo.
In April 1992, the city was the setting for a coordinated series of "Spring of Life" protests led by members of the anti abortion group Operation Rescue.
Nearly 200 protesters were arrested during one demonstration, and abortion rights groups held counter protests.
Police said Slepian was one of the doctors singled out by picketers.
In interviews with The Buffalo News, Slepian said he took the rhetoric of abortion opponents seriously.
In April 1993, one month after the shooting death of a Pensacola, Fla., abortion provider, David Gunn, Slepian spoke about the vulnerability of doctors who provide abortions.
"It probably hits home a little bit because it could have been me," Slepian told The Buffalo News.
"For years I've felt, and I still feel, it could happen to me or to someone around here."
And in 1995, he told The News: "When you're using words like 'kill' and 'murder,' that's where it can lead.
If the rosary holding churchgoers and the bishop don't think that's true, they're fooling themselves."
In 1988, Slepian had clashed with anti abortion protesters outside his home.
Protesters had taunted him during the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, calling him a "murderer."
One protester later claimed that Slepian had attacked him with a baseball bat, though the case was later settled.
Slepian divided his practice between the clinic in Buffalo and his private office in Amherst.
Ms Ward, the clinic spokeswoman, said he had worked at that and other clinics for 15 years.
"He has been harassed right in front of his house," she said.
"His children have been harassed."
She called him a courageous man who followed his principles.
A woman from Attica, N.Y., who identified herself only as Susan, stood outside his Amherst office Saturday, weeping.
She said Slepian should not be portrayed solely as an "abortion doctor."
She said he had delivered her niece and her daughter and that he kept a photo album of the hundreds of babies that he had delivered.
"To me, he was about babies, not abortion," Susan said.
She said she had gone to him every three months for the past four years for treatment of cervical cancer.
"I feel he saved my life.
I feel he is like a member of my family."
In Slepian's affluent Amherst neighborhood of large homes, there was a sense of shock that this protected world could be violated.
The slogan on Amherst police cars reads, "Safest Town in America."
"Every once in a while," said David Guercio, 49, a neighbor walking by the Slepian home Saturday, "we get a pumpkin smashed around here, but that's about it."
Another neighbor, Neel Chary, said Slepian's four sons had told him of a horrible scene.
"They just went into a panic," Chary said.
"The oldest one called the grandpa and said, 'Grandpa, Grandpa, Dad's been shot."
AMHERST, N.Y.
Some of those whom knew him said Dr Barnett Slepian continued to perform abortions in the face of death threats because he had what one friend called "a stubborn kind of courage."
Others said he persisted because he was simply a conscientious doctor and made his decisions not on ideological grounds but because he wanted to practice the full range of gynecological medicine just as he had been trained to do, even if that included the procedures that many in the aggressive anti abortion movement in western New York equated with murder.
"Having babies come into the world was his life," said Ellen Fink, a longtime friend.
"But he performed abortions because he believed it was a women's legal right to choose."
Slepian, a 52 year old gynecologist and obstetrician who lived in this suburb of Buffalo, was shot fatally in the back Friday night as he stood in the kitchen of his home chatting with his wife, Lynne, and his 15 year old son, Andrew.
He had just returned from synagogue where he had gone to mark the yahrzeit or anniversary of his father's death with the Jewish prayer, the kaddish.
On Sunday, his friends, patients and relatives were heartsick at his murder, but also fearful of what they could say because the sniper who lay in wait in the woods behind Slepian's house and shot him with a high powered rifle through an undraped window is at large.
Still, a few took time to talk to reporters because, they said, they wanted to make sure the man they knew was portrayed not as a narrow pro abortion zealot but as a well rounded doctor, father and husband.
Slepian, who as a young man was so determined to become a doctor that he studied medicine in Spanish in Guadalajara, Mexico, when U.S. schools would not accept him, was a person who prized his time with his four sons, Andrew, 15, Brian 13, Michael, 10 and Philip, 7) He capered with them in their backyard swimming pool or taught them the value of work and money by having them mow the lawn in summer and shovel the driveway in winter.
He was a devoted jogger, having run a marathon, and was what one friend said was "a health nut" who was meticulous about his family's health and carefully watched such demons as cholesterol and salt.
He belonged to a Reform synagogue, Temple Beth Am.
He was painfully aware that he and his family could be the target of a fierce opponent of abortions and took precautions.
There had been four attacks against doctors on both side of the U.S. Canadian border.
As recently as Friday morning, Slepian received a two page warning from the downtown Buffalo clinic where he worked urging him to beware of sniper attacks.
"Do not assume that you are safe once you are at home," the warning said.
"Close the drapes in your house so you are not visible from outside."
In fact, Slepian often kept the blinds drawn at home and he called the police whenever he received a death threat.
Neighbors said there were a number of periods when an Amherst patrol car was stationed outside Slepian's two story brick colonial in a well to do enclave here.
But he refused to change his approach to medicine, even when his friends warned him some anti abortion protesters would view his death as a "coup" that virtually eliminated access to abortion in the Buffalo area.
"He knew the risks well," said Glenn Edward Murray, who was Slepian's lawyer and longtime friend.
"We had discussed the fatal dangers he placed himself in by continuing to perform abortions.
We discussed security measures.
He was dedicated to providing women with safe and legal abortions and was unwilling to abandon his clients because of threats."
Murray, who talked in carefully measured tones but still found himself choked with emotion, said Slepian had as a young intern and resident in the Buffalo area been taught by mentors how dangerous and sometimes fatal "back alley" abortions performed by bad practitioners or by the women themselves could be.
Even as he had four children of his own, he was determined that he would perform abortions for women who needed them, no matter how poor they were.
So in addition to a private practice he had in this leafy suburban town in the prairie flat countryside east of Buffalo, Slepian chose to work regularly at a clinic in downtown Buffalo that had been singled out by protesters and was the last of its kind in Buffalo: Buffalo GYN Women's Services.
Now, that clinic has been left without a doctor.
"He had a stubborn kind of courage," Murray said.
"He was resolved not to let the threat eliminate the legal and medical options for patients."
His wife, Lynne, a trained nurse who stayed home in recent years to raise their sons, was as resolute as he was in not letting the protesters stop her husband from practicing medicine as he saw fit.
Slepian, a slender, wiry man with the bearded face of a scholar, was born in Cambridge, Mass., into a lower middle class family of four children, each of whom went on to considerable accomplishment as an adult.
One of his two brothers, Jacob, is also a doctor, specializing in ear, nose and throat medicine.
Slepian, whom friends called Bart, was raised in Rochester, attended college at the University of Denver in Colorado and received his medical degree from the Autonomous University of Guadalajara.
A residency at the State University of Buffalo brought him to this area 20 years ago, and he stayed.
Although gynecologists will quietly perform abortions for their longtime paying patients, Slepian became one of only a handful of doctors in western New York who were willing to perform abortions at public clinics and not hide the fact that they did.
Nonetheless, his friends said, he counseled women seeking abortion to consider alternatives like adoption.
In 1988, protesters taunted him outside his home on Hanukkah.
When he emerged carrying a baseball bat, a clash ensued and Slepian was eventually charged with a misdemeanor for damaging a protester's vehicle.
In 1992 he again became a target in a coordinated protest by 200 picketers from the anti abortion group Operation Rescue that was known as "Spring of Life."
In recent years, patients who visited him at the downtown clinic or his private office in Amherst periodically endured shouts from picketers of "You're murdering your babies."
A longtime patient who asked that she be identified only as Karen said that Slepian frequently apologized for the disruptions the protesters were causing.
Still, Karen said she knew him mainly as a devoted gynecologist who saw her through infertility treatments and delivered her daughter.
"He wasn't supposed to be there for the delivery but he came anyway and when I asked him, 'What are you doing here,' he said: "I wouldn't miss it for the world."
Similarly, she said, he went out of his way to visit another patient when she was in the hospital for a non gynecological ailment.
"I thought I'd come over to have donuts and coffee with you when I heard you were in the hospital," Karen heard that he told the friend.
"He was the type of man," Karen said, "that I would put my life in his hands and not question what he had to say.
And I can't say that about all doctors."
The killing of Dr Barnett Slepian, a gynecologist in Buffalo who performed abortions, has become a factor in at least two campaigns in New York, say political consultants and some campaign advisers.
In the race for attorney general, the Democratic candidate, Eliot Spitzer, who favors abortion rights, has moved quickly to make the anti abortion position of his opponent, Attorney General Dennis Vacco, a central issue in the campaign.
And in the tight race for U.S. Senate, while the Democrat, Charles Schumer, another abortion rights supporter, has not raised Slepian's death himself, his aides say it puts a new emphasis on the issue.
Slepian was shot in the back on Friday night as he stood in his kitchen.
No suspects have been identified.
Even before the killing, Schumer was tyring to draw more attention to the anti abortion record of his opponent, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican who is also running on the Right to Life Party line.
In a New York Times/CBS News poll completed on Saturday, 69 percent of those polled said they did not know D'Amato's position on abortion, and only 19 percent knew that he opposed abortion rights.
Now events are doing the work for Schumer.
Slepian's death was among the first topics raised in Saturday night's debate between the two men, and it was instantly followed by a question to D'Amato on whether he opposed first trimester abortions for adult women.
On Tuesday, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League plans to hold a news conference to screen a television advertisement made last week, before Slepian died featuring Emily Lyons, a nurse who was badly wounded earlier this year in the bombing of an abortion clinic in Alabama.
The advertisement, said Kelli Conlin, the executive director of the New York State affiliate of Naral, is intended to spotlight D'Amato's vote against the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which Schumer sponsored.
The measure made it a Federal crime to attack or blockade an abortion clinic.
Now, Ms Conlin said, it will have new resonance, and the organization is considering buying more air time.
"It's incredibly sincere and powerful and it would have been regardless," she said.
"But sensitivities are so heightened from the shooting in western New York that it's even more powerful."
David Eichenbaum, a Democratic political consultant who is not working for anyone in this year's campaign, said abortion "is no longer the driving issue it once was, at least on the pro choice side."
But, Eichenbaum said: "Sometimes an incident like this will do more to energize those who are pro choice who otherwise might not consider that as an important an issue to go to the polls over.
It brings it home."
D'Amato's aides would not comment about the political ramifications of the slaying, and Schumer's aides would not talk about whether they planned to refer to it in any advertisements, or whether the candidate planned to use it on the campaign trail.
"Both Senator D'Amato and Chuck Schumer agree this was a horrific crime and a horrible tragedy," said Josh Isay, Schumer's campaign manager.
But, Isay added, "it heightens the abortion issue."
Steven Goldstein, the campaign spokesman for Spitzer, was less reticent.
"Eliot is going to make a huge priority of this," Goldstein said.
"Stopping clinic violence is going to be a major theme of our campaign from now to Election Day."
In Sunday's debate against Vacco, Spitzer attacked him for failing to enforce a court order in 1992 against anti abortion protesters who had blocked the entrance to a clinic.
It was the same clinic where Slepian worked.
A federal judge removed Vacco, then the U.S. attorney for western New York, from the case.
He was replaced with two special prosecutors.
Spitzer also criticized Vacco for dismantling the Office of Reproductive Rights, which investigated threats and crimes against abortion clinics, when he became attorney general.
On Monday, Spitzer called for Vacco to revive that unit immediately, vowing that he would do so on his first day in office if elected.
Goldstein, who said it was "thoroughly, thoroughly possible" that the issue would surface in Spitzer's advertisements, defended the use of the issue by noting that the attorney general has direct impact on the issue of clinic access.
Vacco's campaign manager, Matt Behrmann, said in a statement that Spitzer had "sunk to a new and despicable low by attempting to capitalize on the murder of a physician in order to garner votes."
"It's possible that New York politics has never seen anything as crass as Eliot Spitzer's willingness to exploit the unfortunate murder of Slepian as a steppingstone for his own political ambitions," Berhrmann said.
Several consultants agreed that there might be political hay to be made in Slepian's death but that it had to be done carefully.
"Trying to score political points from a homicide can have a backlash," said Maureen Connelly, a media consultant not working for any candidate in next week's election.
Neal Horsley, a 54 year old computer programmer in Carrollton, Ga., does not understand what the fuss is about.
Three years ago, he established a Web site called "The Nuremberg Files," a list attempting, in his words, "to record the name of every person working in the baby slaughter business across the United States of America."
Each name in the list is either in black type, meaning "working", in gray, meaning "wounded," or has a line through it, meaning "fatality."
In an interview Sunday, Horsley said that shortly after hearing news reports Friday night that a doctor who performed abortions had been shot and killed in his kitchen in a suburb of Buffalo, N.Y., he drew a line through the name of the doctor, Barnett Slepian, on the Web site.
Abortion rights organizations have denounced his action, implying that Horsley may have crossed out Slepian's name before he was killed.
"I certainly did not have advance information," Horsley said.
"I'm the only one who can change anything on the Web site.
That's tantamount to saying I knew of and advocated his death.
What is that?
Libel or slander?"
Asked to define his role and that of his Web site, Horsley replied: "I'm a reporter.
I am simply a journalist."
Law enforcement officials would not discuss the investigation of the Slepian killing Sunday, but no one has suggested that the Web site had any connection with the attack.
Horsley said the goal of the Web site was to gather information about doctors who perform abortions so they could be arrested and punished should abortion be made illegal once again.
He said he did not want abortion doctors to escape prosecution for lack of evidence, as happened with some Nazi war criminals, and so he called the site "The Nuremberg Files: Visualize Abortionists on Trial" (http://www.christiangallery.com/atrocity/).
Visitors to the Web site are asked to provide a wide variety of information about people who perform or aid in abortions.
The information includes photos or videotapes of the doctors, their cars, houses, and friends, criminal records, including driving record, mug shots, and fingerprint card, and civil suit records, including "informative depositions and divorce file (if any)."
Horsley said he received his information through e mail and regular mail from anti abortion activists and said he did not regard the compiling of such information as an incitement to violence.
"I have no power to stop them," he said.
Asked about animation that depicts dripping blood under his request for viewers to "e mail evidence or feedback," he replied: "That is the blood of the unborn."
Horsley said he first became aware of Slepian's death "sometime after sunup" on Saturday morning through an E mail or a report on a computerized wire service.
"I did not have a feeling of guilt when I saw it," he said.
"I did not have a feeling of sadness.
We're involved in a war.
There are 4000 babies a day being killed.
To do this work, you have to be like a policeman dealing with the reality of corpses."
He said he had not received communication from anyone taking responsibility for Slepian's death or other attacks on people who perform or aid in abortions.
The Web site has recorded 180000 to 220000 visits per month in the last two years, Horsley said.
On Friday, there were 7886 visits and on Saturday, 18295.
Data for Sunday were not available Sunday night.
NEW YORK In the second and final debate in the race for state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, the Democratic challenger, accused Republican incumbent Dennis Vacco on Sunday of ignoring the threat posed by radical anti abortion advocates, thereby helping to ease the way for this weekend's slaying of an obstetrician.
The obstetrician, Dr Barnett Slepian, was killed by a sniper on Friday night at his home in a Buffalo suburb.
Spitzer seized on the shooting again and again during their half hour debate, which was broadcast live on WABC TV in Manhattan and shown on other network affiliates across the state.
Spitzer cited a ruling in 1992 in which a federal judge rebuked Vacco, who was then the U.S. attorney for western New York, for failing to pursue contempt charges when protesters violated a court order against blocking the entrance to a clinic where Slepian was working.
The judge, Richard Arcara of Buffalo, took the rare step of removing Vacco from the case and replacing him with two special prosecutors.
Spitzer, speaking of his opponent, said, "The horror that occurred the other night should weigh heavily on his conscience."
He also chided Vacco for getting rid of the Office of Reproductive Rights when he became attorney general.
"Mr Vacco disbanded the very unit that was to protect this doctor," Spitzer said.
Vacco responded heatedly, assailing his opponent for exploiting the slaying for political purposes.
"I think it borders on being despicable that Mr Spitzer would try to seek political advantage at the expense of Dr Slepian and Dr Slepian's family," Vacco said.
The incumbent, who is personally opposed to abortion, cited his successful effort to win a U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding a ban on blocking abortion clinics.
After the debate, Kelli Conlin, executive director of the New York chapter of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, said that the case was started under Vacco's predecessor.
If anything, Sunday's debate was even nastier than the first one, which was held in Woodbury, N.Y., on Friday.
Vacco continued hammering Spitzer for refusing to explain inconsistencies regarding his campaign loans.
Less than halfway through the debate, Vacco offered to yield the rest of his time to Spitzer if he would reconcile his campaign spending.
At issue is Spitzer's claim that he had used eight cooperative apartments he owns in Manhattan as collateral for millions of dollars of campaign loans with a document submitted to the state by his father, Bernard Spitzer.
Before the cameras, Vacco waved a document in which the father, a real estate developer, had sworn that the apartments were not being used as collateral.
He suggested Spitzer was being less than candid about the source of his campaign financing.
"Show us the money," Vacco pleaded.
As he did in the Friday debate, Spitzer provided only a bare bones response.
"The documents have been submitted," he said.
"The response is very simple, Mr Vacco: You're wrong on the facts, you're wrong on the law."
Pressed by reporters to say more on the issue after the debate, Spitzer said he would "answer the facts at the right time" and declined to elaborate.
Since those two issues occupied most of the half hour allotted to the debate, the candidates had little time to spell out their ideological differences.
Spitzer once again accused Vacco of diminishing the stature of the attorney general's office, pointing to reports that 80 percent of the people hired since Vacco took over in 1994 had political connections.
Vacco sought to deflect that criticism by enumerating his accomplishments in fighting crime and other areas.
After the debate, two political analysts one a Republican, the other an independent said Spitzer's handling of the questions about his finances had harmed his campaign.
"If it's so easy to explain, why didn't he remove it from the menu?" said Jay Severin, the Republican strategist.
John Zogby, an independent pollster in Utica, N.Y., said that if Spitzer made a simple technical error, he has compounded it by his reticence.
"That could be one of the things that causes Spitzer to sputter," he said.
"I think he's handled it very badly."
On the other hand, Severin said, Spitzer did well by responding so quickly to Slepian's slaying.
"It is evidence of some skill politically that he was able to seize on it," he said.
Since polls indicate that two of three New York voters favor abortion rights, Zogby said, it was a smart move for Spitzer to home in on the shooting as a way to attract Democrats, moderate Republicans and women to the polls.

Five sniper attacks against abortion doctors in Canada and the United States have occurred in the last four years within a few weeks of Nov 11, or Veterans Day, a date observed as Remembrance Day in Canada, but which some anti abortion activists are said to call "Remember the Unborn Children Day."
In each case, a sniper fired a high powered rifle from behind the doctor's home.

BEIJING In response to criticism from home and abroad, Chinese officials broke their silence Wednesday to defend their arrest this week of a prominent dissident who was trying to form an opposition political party.
"Xu Wenli is suspected of involvement in activities damaging to national security and has violated relevant criminal codes of the People's Republic of China," said a statement from the Foreign Ministry, which on Tuesday declined to comment on the arrest.
The sudden arrest on Monday night of Xu, as well as several other activists involved with him in trying to form the China Democratic Party, set off strong protests from human rights groups, other Chinese dissidents and Washington.
"We view his detention for peacefully exercising fundamental freedoms guaranteed by international human rights instruments as a serious step in the wrong direction," State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said in Washington on Tuesday.
U.S. officials in Beijing urged the government to release Xu and asked for clarification as to the exact nature of his crime.
China signed the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights with great fanfare in October, and Xu's arrest is seen by human rights groups as a test of the nation's commitment to its tenets.
Dissidents in and out of China rose to Xu's defense, with more than a dozen activists around the country announcing that they would begin fasts in support of Xu and another leader of the China Democratic Party, Qin Yongmin, who was arrested in his home in Wuhan on Monday.
Almost 200 dissidents signed a letter to the Chinese government protesting the detentions, said the Information Center for Human Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong Kong.
Three other Democratic Party organizers were also detained on Monday, although two of them were released early Wednesday.
But the two more prominent dissidents, Xu and Qin, are likely to face a much longer haul since both have been charged with "criminal acts."
Xu's wife, He Xintong, said Wednesday night that she had still not been informed of the specific charge against her husband, although she surmised from the aggressive behavior of the arresting officers that the sentence "could be long."
Qin's family was told that he was charged with "plotting to subvert the government," a crime that for serious offenses commands sentences of three years to life.
In the Chinese criminal code, this charge comes under a grab bag section called "threatening state security," which makes almost any political activity that questions or hampers the authority of the Communist Party illegal, from "violent or nonviolent activities aimed at overthrowing the government authorities," to "activities designed to change the basic nature of the state."
Xu's and Qin's trouble almost certainly stems from their efforts to gain recognition for the China Democratic Party, a loose network of pro democracy activists in more than a dozen cities around China that was formed this year.
In the last six months they have become increasingly aggressive and defiant in their attempts to register the party with the government, submitting repeated applications even after local authorities had declared the concept of an opposition party illegal.
They say the Chinese Constitution does not specifically forbid the formation of new political parties, although there have been no new parties since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949) In fact, the by laws of the China Democratic Party are fairly tame, they carefully acknowledge the central role of the Communist Party, but also support free speech and free elections for public officials.
"My husband thought the time was right to begin working to form a new party, since China recently signed the covenant on human rights," Ms He said.
In September, a few Democratic Party members got some slightly encouraging signals from local governments, which initially accepted their applications to form a social organization to develop a party.
But in recent weeks, as organizers like Xu became more insistent and defiant, harassment by the police increased.
"All this past week we felt something was going to happen," Ms He said.
"It seemed that anyone who came to visit us was later detained for a while.
And there have been a lot more cars from the Public Security Bureau parked outside than is usual."
NEW YORK A Chinese dissident fleeing a new round of arrests of democracy activists in Shanghai arrived here Wednesday and announced that he and other opponents of the Chinese government plan a demonstration Thursday at the United Nations to protest the crackdown.
The dissident, Yao Zhenxian, who was released in April from a Chinese labor camp, is a leader of the China Democracy Party, which was formed in June during President Clinton's visit to China.
Speaking through an interpreter at Kennedy International Airport, Yao, 44, said little about why he had left Shanghai, except that he and his younger brother, Yao Zhenxiang, 38, had been sent to a labor camp in 1996 on a "trumped up charge" of publishing pornography.
The younger Yao, who is also a prominent figure in the China Democracy Party, is scheduled for release in April.
Last week the Chinese government arrested 10 members and sympathizers of the China Democracy Party, one of whom, Wang Youcai, is to go on trial Dec 17.
"The Chinese government feels it expanded too quickly," Yao said at the airport, referring to his party.
Washington gave Yao a special visa, which expires in February.
Dr Wang Bingzhang, 50, an adviser to the overseas committee of the party, said later that Yao had left China for personal and political reasons.
"They were scared all the time," he said, referring to Yao's wife, Yu Yingzhang, and daughter, Yao Yiting, 14, who accompanied him.
"The family had a terrible life, especially the daughter.
Secret agents followed them all the time."
The family trading business, which was 12 years old, was shuttered by the government in 1996, said Wang, a former surgeon in Beijing, "so they had no way of living."
In addition, after Yao made organizational trips to several provinces, democracy activists urged him to go abroad, Wang said.
"They wanted him to tell the truth about what is really happening in China and to call on the whole world to pay attention," Wang said.
Beatrice Laroche, liaison at the United Nations for Human Rights in China, a New York based group, said the China Democracy Party was a growing presence in some of China's most populous provinces, including Sichuan.
"But their most vocal leaders have all recently been detained," she added.
Ms Laroche said the Yao brothers, especially the younger man, won prominence by helping to finance predecessors of the China Democracy Party with money from the family business before it was closed by the government.
With attorneys locked up, harassed or plain scared, two prominent dissidents will defend themselves against charges of subversion Thursday in China's highest profile dissident trials in two years.
Qin Yongmin's and Wang Youcai's families were running out of options Wednesday to help the pair, leading organizers of a budding opposition political party.
Qin's family pleaded for a postponement at Wuhan's Intermediate People's Court, but court officials denied the request.
Police have detained one lawyer and threatened another, and subtler pressures have been used on others, family members said.
Given the interference, Wang Youcai's wife assumes he will be convicted.
"Whether he has a lawyer or not, whatever he says, the government has already decided," Hu Jiangxia said.
Qin and Wang will be tried separately, in cities 500 kilometers (300 miles) apart and in proceedings attended only by family and a few observers selected by the courts.
Qin, 44, and Wang, 31, are accused of inciting the subversion of state power, apparently for helping to organize the China Democracy Party.
They face from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted under the harshest aspects of the law.
By moving against Qin, Wang and the China Democracy Party, the ruling Communist Party appears to be signaling its determination to crush challenges to its monopoly on power.
Authorities have detained or questioned more than 30 people associated with the party in a 17 day old crackdown.
Qin, a democracy campaigner for 20 years, and Wang, a student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, are among the most active and influential members of China's dissident community.
A third prominent member of the dissident community, Xu Wenli, was also arrested in the crackdown, but not yet charged.
To prevent displays of solidarity outside Wang's trial, police have detained at least ten dissidents in the eastern city of Hangzhou, a Hong Kong based rights group reported.
The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said many more are missing and believed to be in custody.
To prosecute Wang, authorities violated the minimal rights guaranteed suspects under Chinese law and ignored court orders, his wife said.
"Even the judge asked me to hire a lawyer, but while I was doing this, some people were doing things to stop me," Hu Jiangxia said.
During one meeting with a potential defense attorney, a police official stormed in and said, "Don't do anything for them.
Don't take this case.
Whoever takes the case, you can't win," Hu recounted.
Four law firms refused to take Qin's case, his brother Qin Xiaoguang said.
The Information Center said one lawyer who initially agreed to represent Qin on Monday went missing for four hours and then called Qin's family to withdraw.
Dispirited by the harsh treatment, Qin's family argued over whether to attend the trial.
Qin Xiaoguang said he and his father have decided to stay away to protest the unfairness, but another brother will go.
Three dissidents from northeastern China sent an open letter to China's legislature and the Supreme People's Court appealing for fair trials, the Information Center said.
It added that authorities violated China's own laws by not ensuring Wang and Qin have adequate representation.
The letter was the latest in a string of petitions demonstrating the appeal of both Wang and Qin and the idea of the China Democracy Party.
Since Wang publicly announced in June that he and others in Hangzhou were setting up the party, dissidents in at least 14 provinces and cities have set up party branches.
Authorities have refused their applications to register the party as required by law.
Wang and Qin are the most well known dissidents China has put on trial since Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan in 1996.
He was convicted of subversion and served less than two of an 11 year sentence.
In return for his release, he agreed to go into exile.
BEIJING Protesting the lack of a defense lawyer, the father of a prominent dissident is to seek a delay in his son's subversion trial, scheduled to start on Thursday in the central city of Wuhan.
The defendant is Qin Yongmin, 45, a democracy advocate who has spent 10 years in prison and labor camps and has recently promoted an alternative, non Communist political party.
In a telephone interview Wednesday evening, his father, Qin Qinguo, 76, said that before the trial begins, he plans to hand the court a written plea for postponement.
If the plea is ignored, he said he will walk out.
"I wouldn't be able to stand it," the father, a retired steelworker, said, citing his frail health and high blood pressure.
Under China's code of criminal procedure, a defendant has the right to a defense lawyer.
But in this case, the elder Qin said, some lawyers he approached declined to take the case, while others were warned by security officials not to get involved.
The father said he did not agree with his son's political tactics but now he felt he had no choice but to protest his treatment.
Qin Yongmin was arrested on Nov 30, only hours after his mother died of a stroke.
"He wasn't even allowed to attend the funeral," Qin Qinguo said.
"And now he's not allowed to find a lawyer."
On Thursday morning, a few hundred miles to the east in the city of Hangzhou, Wang Youcai, 33, is to go on trial on similar charges of inciting subversion.
He, too, has no defense lawyer.
Wang was a leader of student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989 and served two years in prison after they were put down by military force.
As the founder of the suppressed new political party, the China Democracy Party, he publicly announced its charter in June during President Clinton's visit to China.
Scores of people around the country began to champion the new party, hopeful that closer ties between China and the United States, and China's signing of the international covenant on political and civil rights, would mean a looser political climate.
But the party was soon declared illegal and many adherents were detained, at least temporarily.
Wang now faces charges that could land him in prison for five years or more.
A third veteran dissident and promoter of the new party, Xu Wenli, has been detained for weeks in Beijing and is expected to face similar subversion charges.
In the last two days, at least 10 Democracy Party members or supporters in the Hangzhou area have been detained by the police and others have had their phone lines cut, reported the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China, based in Hong Kong.
BEIJING In a pointed speech delivered to Communist Party members in the Great Hall of the People, President Jiang Zemin made clear Friday that China's economic reforms were not a prelude to Western style multiparty democracy and that those who challenged the party's supremacy would be quashed.
Officially, the speech was intended to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Communist Party meeting that marked the beginning of the reforms.
But it also provided a vigorous, if indirect, defense of the government's recent decision to try three of the country's most prominent democracy activists on criminal charges for their efforts to organize an opposition political party.
The trials of Wang Youcai and Qin Youming opened on Thursday.
They are accused of inciting subversion of the state, charges that carry a minimum prison sentence of five years on conviction, although neither trial has come to a verdict.
And Friday the family of China's most senior dissident, Xu Wenli, another organizer of the opposition party, was told that he would stand trial on Monday, facing an even more serious charge of subverting state power, which could bring a sentence of life imprisonment.
Xu has been detained since Nov 30, after the police raided his house and confiscated documents about the new opposition group, the China Democratic Party.
While vowing to move ahead with economic reforms, Jiang's speech was more conservative politically than others he has made this year.
Again and again he invoked Communist Party dogma, using phrases rarely uttered in the last year, like the "four cardinal principles."
Those state that the leadership of the Communist Party, adherence to the socialist path and the upholding of Mao Zedong Thought and of Marxism Leninism must serve as the foundation for the country.
During President Clinton's state visit in the summer, the world saw President Jiang, agile international political leader, in action.
Friday he was once again General Secretary Jiang, Communist Party stalwart.
China's current political system "must not be shaken, weakened or discarded at any time," Jiang said, adding, "The Western mode of political systems must never be copied."
Later he said, "We must be vigilant against infiltration, subversive activities and separatist activities of international and domestic hostile forces."
China must "fight against factors disrupting social stability and nip them in the bud," he said.
Jiang's remarks on these topics echoed points made two weeks ago by Li Peng, the former prime minister who now heads the National People's Congress, in a rare interview with the German business newspaper Handelsblatt.
Li is usually associated with the more conservative faction of the party.
But Friday, as China is facing harsh criticism from human rights groups and Western governments over its treatment of the China Democratic Party's leaders, the same admonitions came directly from Jiang.
Jiang also said China should not rely too heavily on foreign countries to boost its economic development, and he acknowledged that the party had made some "mistakes" that had left citizens dissatisfied.
Presumably that was a reference to the millions of layoffs caused by a shift toward a market economy, and to the resulting demonstrations that have become commonplace in smaller Chinese cities.
But it was, at heart, a back to basics talk, a reminder that even though many of China's citizens wear tailored suits and tote cellular phones, and even though its billboard lined thoroughfares resemble streets in the West, the country remains a one party dictatorship.
Earlier this year, the founding members of the China Democratic Party, a small, loose network of activists from all over the country, hoped that there might be room for political opposition.
Heartened by the relatively open discourse that surrounded the Clinton visit and later by China's decision to sign the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, the dissidents have repeatedly tried to register their fledgling party as a government recognized social organization.
In the last two months, the official response has moved quickly from neglect, to polite rebuff, to detention, to this week's trials.
It is unclear what will happen to the three men being tried or the many other Democratic Party members who have been detained as they have sought to protest the criminal proceedings.
At the trials of Wang in Hang zhou and Qin in Wuhan, neither man was represented by a lawyer, although allowed by Chinese law, because prospective lawyers were intimidated or detained by local officials, their families said.
In a two and a half hour court session Friday, Wang defended himself.
No defense has yet been presented for Qin.
Xu, who will go on trial on Monday in Beijing, has been given a court appointed lawyer, his wife said.
Xu has already spent more than 10 years in prison.
His indictment accuses him of organizing the China Democratic Party, accepting money from abroad, calling for independent trade unions and making subversive statements in interviews with foreign news organizations.
China's government said Thursday that two prominent dissidents arrested this week are suspected of endangering national security the clearest sign yet Chinese leaders plan to quash a would be opposition party.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao refused to specify what laws were broken or how Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin endangered the state.
A third leading advocate of the China Democracy Party who has been in custody for a month, Wang Youcai, was accused of "inciting the overthrow of the government," the Hong Kong based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
All three men could face up to life in prison if convicted of the harshest measures under China's vague state security law.
The ruling Communist Party has resorted to the law to silence dissent since it went into effect last year.
The arrests of Xu and Qin at their homes Monday night and the accusations against them and Wang were the sharpest action Chinese leaders have taken since dissidents began pushing to set up and legally register the China Democracy Party in June.
Xu and Qin were "suspected of involvement in activities endangering state security" and their "behavior breached relevant provisions of the criminal laws of the People's Republic of China," Zhu said at a twice weekly briefing.
Police in Hangzhou city notified Wang's wife Wednesday that charges have already been submitted to prosecutors, bringing him a step closer to trial, the Information Center said.
Xu and Qin are influential figures in the dissident community, having started their campaign for change 20 years ago in the seminal Democracy Wall movement.
Wang was a student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations.
Both have served time in prison.
Xu spent 12 years in jail, much of it in solitary confinement.
Since dissidents began organizing and trying to legally register the China Democracy Party, police have harassed and briefly detained more than two dozen members, but until now the government had not leveled such politically charged allegations.
The Communist Party has never allowed another political party to form since it took power in 1949.
In Washington on Wednesday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the United States deplored the arrests and said the dissidents' peaceful political activities were fundamental human rights that all governments should protect.
U.S. officials conveyed their concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urged that Xu and Qin be released immediately.
Zhu criticized the United States for condemning the arrests, saying that "no country, including the United States, should interfere in China's internal affairs."
China in October signed a key U.N. treaty on civil and political rights that guarantees freedom of expression and freedom of association.
It was the 17th international human rights treaty China has signed.
Zhu told reporters there was "absolutely no contradiction at all" between China's support for these treaties and its arrests of the two dissidents.
China's central government ordered the arrest of a prominent democracy campaigner and may use his contacts with exiled Chinese dissidents to charge him with harming national security, a colleague said Wednesday.
Two Beijing police officers spent 30 minutes telling Zha Jianguo to stop trying to set up a political opposition party.
Underscoring the warning, they said his colleague, Xu Wenli, won't be released soon and may be charged for having links to "reactionary groups," Zha said.
Xu and another influential dissident, Qin Yongmin, were arrested Monday night in police raids in two cities that delivered the sternest blow so far to a five month campaign to establish the China Democracy Party and challenge the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on power.
Qin was arrested for plotting to overthrow the government, a crime that could land him in jail for life.
A third Democracy Party advocate, Wang Youcai, already in custody for a month, was also formally arrested Monday although his family has not been informed of the charges.
Zha, who helped Xu organize would be party members in Beijing and the nearby port of Tianjin, said police officers told him Xu's arrest was ordered by the central government, not Beijing police.
He took the police reference to "reactionary groups" to mean exiled dissidents in the United States.
Under China's vague State Security Law, such links may also be punishable by up to life in prison.
Zha pledged to work with dissidents in China and exiles in the United States to campaign "to save Xu Wenli."
On Wednesday, 190 dissidents from around the country demanded in an open letter that the government release Xu, Qin and Wang Youcai, saying the arrests run counter to U.N. human rights treaties China has signed over the past 14 months.
The authorities "are deceiving and cheating international public opinion while on the other hand they are suppressing and persecuting domestic political dissidents," said the letter faxed to foreign news agencies.
In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the United States deplored the detention and arrests of Xu and Qin.
"We believe the peaceful political activities of this kind and other forms of peaceful expression that they've been involved in are fundamental human rights that should be protected by all governments," Lockart said.
"We call on the Chinese government to assure the protection in these cases of Mr Xu and Mr Qin."
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said U.S. officials conveyed their concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urged that Xu be released immediately.
U.S. officials received confirmation Wednesday that Xu is being detained on suspicion of "having conducted activities damaging to China's national security," Rubin said.
He said he had no information from Chinese authorities about Qin or Wang.
Two other democracy party supporters taken into custody in central Wuhan city along with Qin Chen Zhonghe and Xiao Shichang were released Wednesday morning, said He Xintong, Xu Wenli's wife.
She added that police questioned the pair about the party as well as Qin's human rights monitoring organizations.
Qin and Xu are towering figures in China's persecuted dissident community.
Their activism dates to the seminal Democracy Wall movement of the 1970s.
Wang was a student leader in 1989's influential Tiananmen Square democracy movement.
All have spent time in prison, Xu for 12 years, much of it in solitary confinement.
Xu's wife said she does not know where he is being held and, in her 20 year experience with the authorities, believes they are unlikely to tell her.
Released in 1993, Xu picked up his campaigning for political change soon after his parole ended last year.
He has tried to use China's nascent legal system and the international treaties it signed to push for reform.
"My husband is innocent and there's nothing he can be criticized for," said his wife, He Xintong.
"They're going to have to expend a lot of effort to make him a criminal."
BEIJING One leader of a suppressed new political party will be tried on Dec 17 on a charge of colluding with foreign enemies of China "to incite the subversion of state power," according to court documents given to his wife on Monday.
The decision to try the leader, Wang Youcai, a founder of the China Democracy Party, with unusual speed suggests how serious the Communist authorities are in their campaign to destroy the fledgling party and silence dissidents who had begun to speak out over the last year.
The charges that Wang faces, in a trial that will almost certainly be secret and quick, could bring a sentence of five years or more.
Wang, 32, has been imprisoned in his home city, Hangzhou in eastern China, for a month, but was not formally arrested until Nov 30.
On that day two prominent dissidents, both promoters of the new party, were detained.
One, Qin Yongmin, 45, of the central city of Wuhan, and the other, Xu Wenli, 55, of Beijing, are being held on suspicion of subversive activities.
Detailed charges have not been filed.
Wang was a student leader in the pro democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
After the army had crushed the movement, Wang was arrested and served two years in prison.
Qin and Xu became known as democracy advocates in the late 1970s.
Qin was imprisoned for eight years.
In 1993 he was put in a labor camp for two years.
Xu spent 12 years in prison.
When President Clinton visited in the spring, Wang announced the formation of the Democracy Party.
He and other dissidents hoped that China's new friendship with the United States and its decision to sign a global covenant on political and civil rights would give them room to promote political alternatives.
After Clinton returned home Wang was detained, warned and released, only to be re arrested as authorities began what now appears to be a major crackdown on dissent.
Monday, Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, was handed the bill of prosecution, according to the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong Kong.
Wang is charged with helping draft a party manifesto that states, in part, "Only by establishing an opposition party can we be rid of this despotism."
That is cited as grounds for the subversion charge, the information center said.
In addition to detailing Wang's organizing activities, the prosecutors charge that he colluded with enemies of the state abroad, making his crime far more serious under Chinese law.
He used e mail to send 18 copies of the party's founding documents abroad, met with a member of a subversive foreign organization and received money from foreign sources to buy a computer, the indictment reportedly says.
BEIJING The separate trials of two prominent democracy advocates for inciting subversion of the state opened Thursday morning, with the families of both defendants protesting their inability to hire defense lawyers.
The trial in the eastern city of Hangzhou of Wang Youcai, 32, founder of the China Democracy Party, which is now suppressed, was in session for just two hours and 10 minutes.
It appears to be finished, although the court did not announce a decision or say when it would.
"I don't know what happens from here," said Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, who was one of three relatives allowed to attend the trial.
"I don't hold much hope," she added in a telephone interview.
Wang, who spent two years in prison after the 1989 student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, was accused of organizing a political party that sought to overturn Communist Party rule and of colluding with foreign enemies of the state.
He could face five years or more in prison.
Since all the lawyers his family approached were intimidated by security agents, Ms Hu said, Wang tried to mount his own defense Thursday morning after prosecutors laid out their case.
But the judge frequently interrupted him and cut him off after half an hour, saying he was not responding to the specific facts of the case, she added.
Wang argued that his activities were legal under China's constitution and under an international covenant on political rights that China has signed, Ms Hu said.
In the central city of Wuhan, the trial on similar charges of Qin Yongmin, 45, a veteran dissident, also continued for something over two hours.
It will apparently be continued, said Qin's father, Qin Qingguo, since the session ended after the prosecution presented its charges.
In that case, too, prospective lawyers had been intimidated or detained, family members said.
The elderly father's request to the court Thursday morning for a postponement was ignored, so he and one of the defendant's brothers stayed outside the court building in protest, leaving another brother inside.
"We didn't feel there was any reason to observe the trial because if Qin Yongmin did not have a defense attorney, then as far as we were concerned the proceedings were meaningless," the father said by telephone.
The U.S. Embassy asked to observe the trials.
When an embassy official arrived at the court in Hangzhou Thursday morning, he was told that there were no seats available and instead waited outside, greeting Ms Hu when she emerged, shaken, from the brief trial.
China released a respected, but ailing labor rights campaigner from a prison work camp Sunday and immediately sent him into exile in the United States.
Releasing Liu Nianchun appeared to be an attempt by the government to blunt international criticism over Monday's upcoming trial of prominent dissident Xu Wenli.
Xu is the third leading member of a would be opposition political party put on trial for subversion in a three week crackdown that has seen 30 dissidents arrested or interrogated.
Although pleased that Liu Nianchun was free, human rights groups decried the Chinese government's timing as manipulative.
"We don't want to give any credit to the Chinese government for this cynical game it is playing," said Xiao Qiang, director of New York based Human Rights in China.
After 3 1/2 years in prison, Liu was taken from the Tuanhe labor camp on the outskirts of Beijing, driven to the capital's airport and put on a Canadian Air flight, ultimately bound for New York, his mother and brother said.
Accompanying Liu into exile was his wife, Chu Hailan, and their 11 year old daughter, the family said.
Liu Nianchun's release follows the same pattern China used in freeing its two most famous dissidents, Wei Jingsheng in Nov 1997 and Wang Dan in April.
Authorities released Liu on medical parole, exactly five months before the end of his prison term, provided he go into exile, Liu Qing said.
Liu Nianchun, 50, has been in ill health for at least two years.
In an exam authorities finally agreed to provide last month, doctors discovered Liu had tumors in his mouth, stomach and bowels, Liu Qing said.
Like Wang and Wei, the United States and other Western governments have lobbied China to release Liu.
Chinese leaders have been forcing well known dissidents into exile throughout the 1990s, finding that once abroad they lose their influence among dissidents at home.
In the only official comment on the release, the Xinhua News Agency reported that judicial departments took into account Liu's health and behavior in the labor camp in approving his parole for medical treatment.
"I am very happy for Liu Nianchun, but at the same time sending people directly from prison into exile is a type of human rights violation and persecution," Liu Qing said in a telephone interview from his home in New York's Brooklyn borough.
Liu Nianchun was one of the most respected figures in the fractured, persecuted dissident community.
His more than 3 1/2 years in prisons and labor camps was a sad illustration of the way China's Communist Party rulers punish people they deem a threat.
Liu was imprisoned three times in the past 17 years.
His last arrest came after he signed a petition calling for labor rights in May 1995.
Liu was never put on trial.
Fourteen months passed before his wife, Chu Hailan, first learned of his fate and whereabouts: a three year spell in a labor camp in the frigid, remote northeast.
His term was the maximum police may impose on criminal suspects without trial.
Labor camp officials later extended Liu's sentence by a year for trying to escape, a charge Chu claimed was fabricated.
Inside the labor camp, Liu once started a hunger strike to protest his treatment.
He was beaten with cattle prods and confined to a room of 2 square meters (2 square yards) where he could only sit or stand.
His wife fearlessly endured police harassment, beatings and detentions in campaigning for his release.
Chu was dragged away and hit by security forces when she tried to hand a letter to U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson outside a Beijing hotel in September.
Declaring him a martyr of the faith, Pope John Paul II on Saturday honored Croatia's World War II cardinal, a hero to Roman Catholics, but long a symbol of divisions in the Balkans.
Half a million od people watched with delight and gratitude as John Paul beatified Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, elevating him to the last step before possible sainthood, in Marija Bistrica, Croatia's leading Marian shrine to the Virgin Mary.
John Paul appealed to a country that has suffered from war and ethnic divisions "to forgive and reconcile and to purify one's memory of hatred" and "the desire for revenge."
The pope said Stepinac "having endured in his own body and his own spirit the atrocities of the communist system is now entrusted to the memory of his fellow countrymen with the radiant badge of martyrdom."
Stepinac was hailed as a hero by Catholics for his resistance to communism and refusal to separate the Croatian church from the Vatican.
But his beatification, the last step before possible sainthood, is controversial because many Serbs and Jews accuse him of sympathizing with the Nazis.
While serving as Zagreb's archbishop in 1941, Stepinac supported Croatia's German backed fascist puppet government led by dictator Ante Pavelic.
By 1942, however, Stepinac denounced the regime's genocidal policies, which led to the extermination of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents.
He died at 62 in 1960 while under house arrest following his conviction on charges of collaborating with the Nazis.
Stepinac's own notes and recent studies say he spoke out against the atrocities, and worked to save lives, but many Serbs still consider him a war criminal.
The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a U.S. based Nazi hunting group, also had asked the Vatican to postpone the beatification pending further study of the cardinal's actions, although some local Jews defended Stepinac.
John Paul addressed the criticism in his homily, quoting from a 1943 address by the cardinal condemning injustices and the killing of innocents.
He said Stepinac's figure summed up "the whole tragedy which befell the Croatian people and Europe in the course of this century marked by the three great evils of fascism, national socialism and communism."
"He is now in the joy of heaven, surrounded by those who, like him, fought the good fight, purifying their faith in the crucible of suffering," said John Paul, speaking from an altar before a 5 meter (15 foot) high portrait of Stepinac.
A silver box, containing a relict of the new church blessed a finger was placed under the portrait.
The pope, who battled communism in his own Polish homeland, stressed Stepinac's treatment by Yugoslavia's communist regime after the war, saying the last 15 years of his life "were a continual succession of trials."
Some 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million population is Catholic, and the Vatican looks at the country as a Catholic bastion in the Balkans, amid Orthodox Christians and Muslims.
Stipe Dorotic, a 38 year electrician from eastern Croatia, who attended the ceremony said hoped that the beatification "will enable Croats to face the future with more confidence and faith."
Croatia was a part of communist run Yugoslavia until 1991, when it proclaimed independence.
The Vatican was one of the first states to recognize its independence.
The secession of Croatia, and later of neighboring Bosnia, led to bloody wars in which tens of thousands of people were killed.
It is John Paul's second visit to Croatia, following a 1994 pilgrimage.
He flew to Sarajevo last year, realizing his desire to pay tribute to those who suffered during the war.
He also toured Slovenia in the former Yugoslavia, but has not been to Serbia, apparently because of resistance from Orthodox leaders.
MARIJA BISTRICA, Croatia Hailing the World War II archbishop of Zagreb as a martyr to "the atrocities of the communist system," Pope John Paul II beatified him on Saturday.
Beatification is the final step before sainthood.
But by paying such homage to Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who was imprisoned by the Tito regime as a Nazi collaborator, the pope also stepped into one of the most divisive Serbo Croatian disputes in all the embattled regions of the former Yugoslavia.
Stepinac is a national hero to millions of Roman Catholic Croats, and to Croatia's nationalist president, Franjo Tudjman.
To Orthodox Serbs, who formed a minority in Croatia for centuries but have largely left or been driven from Tudjman's state, the beatification is a political provocation.
They have long viewed Stepinac as a wartime sympathizer with the pro Nazi puppet regime that killed tens, even hundreds, of thousands of Serbs, Jews and Gypsies a regime that many here see as the precursor of today's independent state.
In his pastoral visit to Croatia, the ailing 78 year old pope, who has been in office 20 years this month, seems to be viewing history through a different prism than the peoples he says he wants to reconcile.
It is perhaps not surprising that the Polish born John Paul, who used his pulpit to help topple Soviet totalitarianism, would revere a church leader who was persecuted by the Communists and died under house arrest in 1960.
But in post communist Croatia, it has been a long time since religion was viewed as a bulwark against an atheist oppressor.
As one of the few tangible differences between Serbs, Croats and Muslims, religion has for the last 10 years been a main ingredient of the nationalist hatreds that have fed their war.
Among the more than 350000 believers who crowded on a steep, damp hill in front of the pope's outdoor altar, people expressed pride in the beatification and defiance of its critics.
"It is good to have a saint of our own, someone to speak to God for us," said Kruno Cabraka, 20, a Zagreb student who arrived in Marija Bistrica at 2 a.m. to secure a glimpse of the pope.
He shrugged off the complaints of minorities: "We don't care about their saints.
Why should they care about ours?"
John Paul has not visited Orthodox Serbia but has made several trips to other regions of the former Yugoslavia, always preaching peace and unity in an area brutally torn by ethnic and religious differences.
In 1994 he made his first visit to Croatia, which is more than 75 percent Catholic and which lost a third of its territory to the Serbs after it broke away from Yugoslavia in a 1991 war.
Earlier this year, the United Nations returned control of Eastern Slavonia the last Serb dominated area in Croatia to the Tudjman government.
But tensions there remain high.
The Orthodox Church is unforgiving of what it sees as the Catholic Church's complicity in the systematic murder, eviction or forced conversion of Serbs during World War II.
Under the authoritarian leadership of Tudjman, moreover, many Croats are recasting the pro Nazi Ustashe as patriots and founding fathers of the modern Croatian state.
The rehabilitation of Stepinac strikes a raw nerve at the heart of this revisionism.
After Germany invaded Yugoslavia in 1941, Ante Pavelic led a pro Nazi dictatorship that controlled a newly independent Croatia.
The archbishop of Zagreb, a fervent anti communist, initially embraced the Pavelic government as "God's hand at work."
But as evidence mounted of atrocities against Serbs, Jews and other minorities, the archbishop withdrew his support.
By 1942 he began denouncing Ustashe excesses, once in a letter to Pavelic and, in 1943, in church homilies and letters to priests.
Arrested by Tito's forces in 1946, the archbishop was given a show trial, imprisoned and released under house arrest in 1951.
Pope Pius XII later made him cardinal.
The Vatican and many historians credit him with saving hundreds of Jewish and Serbian lives, but his critics maintain that by not speaking out more, he condoned and effectively supported the Ustashe regime.
To Serbs he has long been a symbol of the many Catholic priests who cooperated with the Ustashe.
John Paul II, who has canonized more than 270 people and beatified close to 800, has made more saints than any other pope in history.
The cause of Stepinac is one of the most controversial to date.
A week before he left Rome, the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Paris asked the Vatican to delay beatification of Stepinac until historians could give the case further study.
The intervention infuriated Croatian officials as well as the Vatican.
In Croatia, the Jewish community expressed resignation.
"There is no question he saved hundreds of Jews and others," said Slavko Goldstein, leader of the Jewish community in Croatia, which numbers about 2000.
He described the cardinal's record as mixed.
"He tried to correct some of the worst aspects, but he never condemned the regime as such," Goldstein said.
He expressed regret that the beatification linked entirely to the cardinal's resistance to communism was unlikely to prompt Croats to examine a wartime past clouded in myth.
"This will not clarify the period of World War II," Goldstein added.
"Croatian society has yet to deal with something that Germans have dealt with successfully."
The pope seemed indirectly to address some of the questions that the beatification has raised.
"Blessed Alojzije Stepinac did not shed his blood in the strict sense of the word," he said, alluding to the fact that martyrs are usually slain by their persecutors.
"His death was caused by the long suffering he endured."
He also made a veiled reference to the speed with which the Croatian church leader had been beatified, a process that in many cases can take centuries.
"Very little time separates us from the life and death of Cardinal Stepinac," John Paul said, "barely 38 years.
We all know the context of this death: a continual succession of trials."
The beatification may also owe its speed to the pope's fear that a successor may be less sensitive to the East European Church's struggle against communism, to which he has devoted much of his life.
On a sun basked seaside packed with pilgrims, Pope John Paul II sought Sunday to heal the wounds left by war and totalitarian rule, urging a renewal in Croatian society.
Hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholics jammed a beach outside this Adriatic coastal city for John Paul's final Mass of the three day trip to Croatia.
Scores of fishing and pleasure boats anchored off shore sounded their sirens when the pope arrived from Zagreb.
Adding to the numbers were Croat pilgrims from Montenegro, who streamed in when the border crossing was opened Saturday night for the first time since war ended in 1995, state run Croatian television reported.
"Croats are today called to give a new face to their country, above all by committing themselves to the renewal in society of the ethical and moral values undermined by past totalitarianism and by the recent violence of war," John Paul said.
"It is an urgent task, for without values there can be no true freedom or democracy."
Reconciliation and the renewal of values have been high on the pope's agenda during his stay.
The breakup of Yugoslavia sparked a civil war in 1991 that left over 10000 dead and thousands missing before the 1995 Dayton Accords ended the fighting.
Split was untouched by the fighting, but Zadar, Sibenik and Dubrovnik along the Dalmatian Coast were both heavily damaged.
Dubrovnik suffered damage to some of its art and cultural treasures.
The pope mentioned this in his homily.
"The eye of man can no longer rejoice in them," he said of losses to architectural masterpieces.
"How can we not feel regret for this?"
Some 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million population is Catholic, and the Vatican looks at the country as a Catholic bastion in the Balkans, amid Orthodox Christians in Serbia and Muslims in Bosnia.
For most Croats, the highlight of the pope's three day visit was Saturday's beatification of the controversial World War II cardinal, Alojzije Stepinac.

Roman Catholics hail Stepinac as a martyr, but many Serbs and Jews accuse him of sympathizing with the Nazis.
Beatification is the last step before possible sainthood.
Bestowing on him the "radiant badge of martyrdom," Pope John Paul II on Saturday honored Croatia's World War II cardinal, a hero to Roman Catholics, but long a symbol of divisions in the Balkans.
Before a huge crowd spread over several muddy hillsides overlooking Croatia's main shrine to the Virgin Mary, John Paul beatified Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, elevating him to the last step before possible sainthood.
More than 400000 people stood solemnly under damp trees at the open air site, as far as a kilometer (half mile) from the altar.
John Paul appealed to a country that has suffered from war and ethnic divisions "to forgive and reconcile and to purify one's memory of hatred" and "the desire for revenge."
The pope said Stepinac "having endured in his own body and his own spirit the atrocities of the communist system is now entrusted to the memory of his fellow countrymen with the radiant badge of martyrdom."
Stepinac was hailed as a hero by Catholics for his resistance to communism and refusal to separate the Croatian church from the Vatican.
But his beatification, the last step before possible sainthood, is controversial because many Serbs and Jews accuse him of sympathizing with the Nazis.
While serving as Zagreb's archbishop in 1941, Stepinac supported Croatia's German backed fascist puppet government led by dictator Ante Pavelic.
By 1942, however, Stepinac denounced the regime's genocidal policies, which led to the extermination of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents.
He died at 62 in 1960 while under house arrest following his conviction on charges of collaborating with the Nazis.
Stepinac's own notes and recent studies say he spoke out against the atrocities, and worked to save lives, but many Serbs still consider him a war criminal.
The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a U.S. based Nazi hunting group, also had asked the Vatican to postpone the beatification pending further study of the cardinal's actions, although some local Jews defended Stepinac.
John Paul addressed the criticism in his homily, quoting from a 1943 address by the cardinal condemning injustices and the killing of innocents.
He said Stepinac's figure summed up "the whole tragedy which befell the Croatian people and Europe in the course of this century marked by the three great evils of fascism, national socialism and communism."
"He is now in the joy of heaven, surrounded by those who, like him, fought the good fight, purifying their faith in the crucible of suffering," said John Paul, speaking from an altar before a 5 meter (15 foot) high portrait of Stepinac.
The pope, who battled communism in his own Polish homeland, stressed Stepinac's treatment by Yugoslavia's communist regime after the war, saying the last 15 years of his life "were a continual succession of trials."
Some 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million population is Catholic, and the Vatican looks at the country as a Catholic bastion in the Balkans, amid Orthodox Christians and Muslims.
Stipe Dorotic, a 38 year electrician from eastern Croatia, who attended the ceremony said hoped that the beatification "will enable Croats to face the future with more confidence and faith."
Croatia was a part of communist run Yugoslavia until 1991, when it proclaimed independence.
The Vatican was one of the first states to recognize its independence.
The secession of Croatia, and later of neighboring Bosnia, led to bloody wars in which tens of thousands of people were killed.

SPLIT, Croatia At a seaside mass here Pope John Paul II called for reconciliation throughout the former Yugoslavia and urged the world to do more for the victims of the Balkan war that ended not long ago in Croatia and that has most recently raged in Kosovo.
"How could we not recall with anxious concern the continuing tragedy taking place in nearby Kosovo?" the pope asked from a vast podium built to look like a ship's prow before hundreds of thousands of believers squeezed along the shore and onto boats bobbing in the water.
"May understanding, mutual respect, forgiveness and reconciliation at last take the place of violence and destruction."
He urged the international community to "not fail to provide its timely help."
The pope's visit was joyously welcomed by Croats and the nationalist government of President Franjo Tudjman.
Tudjman's popularity has waned even among Catholics under his strong armed leadership and the country's economic and social troubles.
The archbishop of Zagreb, Monsignor Josip Bozanic, 49, who was appointed a year ago, has frequently spoken out against corruption in the government and other failings.
The Croatian president took every opportunity to place himself at the pope's side during the three day visit.
He had a private audience on Saturday afternoon in his residential palace in Zagreb, a modernist glass and brick house built for Tito in the 1950s.
But the pope did not give his host a blank check.
At the mass, and later in his farewell remarks at the airport, John Paul II rather pointedly called on Croats to make "society and its civil institutions more democratic" in a country that is rarely described as open and free.
"After long years of dictatorship and the terrible experiences of violence which the peoples of this region have undergone," the pontiff said at the airport, "it is now necessary to make every effort to construct a democracy based on the moral values inscribed in the very nature of the human being."
For much of the visit, however, the pope's attention was focused on another, more remote conflict, namely the Catholic Church's struggle against Communism during the Cold War, which the Polish born pope experienced first hand.
The pope arrived in Croatia, a country of 4 million that is more than 75 percent Catholic, on Friday to beatify one of Croatia's national heros, Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who was persecuted by Tito after World War II and died under house arrest in 1960.
Beatification is the final step before sainthood, and the homage was highly controversial.
Though many historians say that Stepinac helped save the lives of hundreds of Jews and others during the war, he was tried as a Nazi collaborator by the Communists.
He is still viewed by Orthodox Serbs as the symbol of the Croatian Catholic Church's complicity with the Ustashe, the World War II fascist regime that killed tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of Serbs, Jews and other minorities.
The Tudjman government has sought to rehabilitate the Ustashe regime as the founder of the modern, independent Croatian state.
Croatia's centuries old Serbian minority has mostly left or been driven out of Tudjman's state.
In 1994, when the pope made his first papal visit to Croatia, the country was still in the throes of a war started when Croatia broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991 and lost a third of its territory to Serbs.
Earlier this year, the United Nations returned control of the last Serb dominated area in Croatia, Eastern Slavonia, to the Croatian government.
Prosperity has not yet returned along with the fragile peace.
As the pope lamented Croatia's tragic past and uncertain present, he also reminded Catholics not to follow the West too closely in its search for a better future.
At a meeting with the Croatian Bishop's Conference after the Sunday mass, John Paul II reminded Croatian church leaders to keep followers in line.
"Today, in the new democratic climate, it is necessary to give strong support to the new evangelization, so that the human person, the family and society as a whole will not be harmed and fall into the trap of consumerism and hedonism" the pope said.

Ailing Philippine Airlines and prospective investor Cathay Pacific Airways have clashed over the laying off of PAL workers, prompting PAL to revive talks with another foreign airline, an official said Tuesday.
PAL earlier accepted a preliminary investment offer from Cathay Pacific, and the companies announced Nov 10 that they would draw up a comprehensive plan to rehabilitate the Philippine flag carrier.
President Joseph Estrada's executive secretary, Ronaldo Zamora, said the two airlines have disagreed on how many of PAL's more than 8000 workers should be laid off to make the airline viable.
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said that Hong Kong based Cathay Pacific wants to trim PAL's work force to about 5000, but PAL chairman and chief stockholder Lucio Tan did not want to cut the number of workers below 8000 to avoid antagonizing the company's unions.
Cathay Pacific also wants to lay off about 200 PAL pilots, a proposal also opposed by Tan, Zamora said.
Tan wants to retain the 200 pilots because they stood by him when the majority of PAL's pilots staged a devastating strike in June.
Tan has gone to the United States to try to revive talks with Northwest Airlines, which earlier expressed interest in investing in PAL, Zamora said.
Zamora said Northwest was larger than Cathay Pacific "and maybe its first action would not be to fire employees."
PAL spokesman Rolando Estabillo did not comment on the reported disagreement but said negotiations between the two companies were continuing.
He said Cathay Pacific was still studying PAL's financial records.
Katherine Wang, a spokeswoman for Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong, said it has not asked PAL to lay off workers.
She said the companies must first reach agreement on Cathay Pacific's entry into PAL before such operational details can be discussed.
"Our view is that the manpower requirements of PAL are to be discussed over the long term.
Cathay Pacific has no definite plan as far as staffing is concerned," Wang said.
She declined to comment on Zamora's and Espiritu's statements and said Cathay Pacific's negotiations with PAL "will still carry on."
PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept 23 after failing to persuade its largest union to accept a management proposed recovery plan under which its collective bargaining agreement would be suspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of the company's stock.
The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL to resume domestic flights on Oct 7 and international flights later.
As part of the plan, the union agreed to allow an unspecified number of workers to be retrenched as long as the laid off workers get separation benefits agreed by both sides.
In June, PAL was embroiled in a crippling three week pilots' strike that brought the company close to financial ruin.
At the height of the strike, PAL laid off 5000 of its 13000 workers to minimize its losses.
PAL says it is unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of debt due to mounting losses worsened by its labor problems and Asia's currency crisis.
President Joseph Estrada on Saturday urged militant unionists at Philippine Airlines to accept a vote by workers approving a 10 year no strike deal to revive the debt laden airline.
On Friday, about 61 percent of the members of PAL's largest union accepted the proposal to suspend collective bargaining in exchange for 20 percent of the company's stock and seats on its board.
Hardline union members say they will file charges questioning the legality of agreement, but Estrada urged them to accept the referendum results.
"It's very clear that majority have agreed to it and voted freely," said Estrada during his weekly radio program.
"Everybody has to sacrifice.
Labor and management should cooperate at this time of crisis."
Following the outcome of the referendum, PAL said it can resume flights to 14 domestic destinations next Wednesday and to nine international destinations within several weeks.
It was the second time that the 6700 members of PAL's largest union have voted on the rescue plan.
Last week, they rejected the proposal, forcing the airline to shut down and leaving much of the country without air service.
Estrada assured workers that he will defend their rights during the 10 year CBA suspension.
The Philippine president also assured the International Labor Organization the proposed suspension is only a temporary measure and would help the government cope with the Asian crisis.
"It is not true that I am anti labor," he said.
"This is only a temporary and will not deny workers' rights."
The union had been sharply split over the proposal, with militant members saying a suspension of the bargaining agreement would violate workers' rights.
Many union members had believed the government would not allow the 57 year old flag carrier to close.
But when government enlisted foreign carriers began flying some domestic routes on Monday, union leaders reversed their position and agreed to accept the management plan.
The agreement must be formally endorsed by workers, regulators and PAL's creditors.
Management said at least 2000 workers will be recalled to handle domestic operations, and most of the airline's 8600 current workers will be recalled once international flights are fully operational.
Asia's currency crisis hit shortly after PAL launched a dlrs 4 billion modernization program, greatly inflating the amount of money it must repay to overseas creditors.
It has been unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of debt.
The number of labor strikes and lockouts in the Philippines has declined this year despite business difficulties caused by Asia's financial crisis, the labor department said Sunday.
The department said 712 strikes and lockouts have occurred so far, a drop of 14 percent compared to 827 in the same period last year.
The number of workers who joined the strikes also declined by 20 percent from more than 210000 to 175500.
Early mediation by labor officials contributed to an easing of labor unrest in the country, the department said in a statement.
The country, however, suffered one of its worst labor problems when flag carrier Philippine Airlines was forced to shut down Sept 23 due to disputes with its largest labor union and mounting debts and losses, partly caused by the regional financial turmoil.
PAL laid off more than 3000 employees at the height of its labor and financial troubles this year, the biggest single retrenchment in the Philippines.
PAL resumed domestic flights Oct 7 and started restoring international flights last month after settling its labor problems.
It has since accepted an investment offer from Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific and the two airlines are drawing up a plan to rehabilitate the Philippine carrier.
Prospective investor Cathay Pacific Airways wants the number of employees at troubled Philippine Airlines to be slashed from more than 8000 to 5000 but PAL has not yet agreed, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said Monday.
PAL officials have accepted an investment offer from the Hong Kong based carrier and the two companies are drawing up a comprehensive plan to rehabilitate PAL.
PAL's chairman and chief stockholder, Lucio Tan, wants to retain about 8000 employees to avoid antagonizing the airline's labor unions, Espiritu said.
"That is the point of disagreement now because Cathay wants a larger retrenchment," Espiritu told reporters.
Cathay Pacific officials were not immediately available for comment.
Espiritu said Cathay Pacific may invest as much as dlrs 100 million in PAL but other foreign investors, including the International Finance Corp., the World Bank's investment arm, are interested in investing part of that amount.
PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept 23 after failing to persuade its largest union to accept a management proposed recovery plan under which its collective bargaining agreement would be suspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of the company's stock.
The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL to resume domestic flights on Oct 7 and international flights later.
As part of the plan, the union agreed to allow an unspecified number of workers to be retrenched as long as the laid off workers get separation benefits agreed by both sides.
In June, PAL was embroiled in a crippling three week pilots' strike that brought the company close to financial ruin.
At the height of the strike, PAL laid off 5000 of its 13000 workers to minimize its losses.
PAL says it is unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of debt due to mounting losses worsened by its labor problems and Asia's currency crisis.
Cathay Pacific Airways said Wednesday it had pulled out of talks to buy a stake in ailing Philippine Airlines making the uncertain future at PAL even cloudier.
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he would try to coax the two sides back together, but it was unclear whether Cathay was out of the picture for good.
"There is now a real risk of PAL going bust, and this time for real," said airline analyst John Hetherington of Paribas Asia Equity Ltd. "PAL is back in the unfortunate position of finding a new suitor."
But another industry expert suggested the talks between Hong Kong's flag carrier and PAL might still be "pretty fluid."
"This game has been going on for quite a while," said airline analyst Peter Tang at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd. Cathay said it had withdrawn its bid to pour up to U.S. dlrs 100 million into debt ridden PAL because of "certain issues which could not be resolved," according to a statement from company secretary P.A. Moore.
Moore would not elaborate on the stumbling blocks.
But Philippine officials said Cathay and PAL had run into difficulties in two areas: who would manage PAL and how many workers would lose their jobs.
Cathay executives did not immediately return a reporter's telephone inquiries about whether they would consider fresh talks with PAL.
Cathay shares were little changed in trading Wednesday's on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
Estrada appeared unwilling to give up on PAL, which stopped flying in a labor dispute in September but soon got back into the air.
"As much as PAL is the flag carrier, we should see to it that PAL will always fly.
If PAL will close down, so many businesses will be affected," Estrada said.
Meanwhile, PAL executive vice president Manolo Aquino said the carrier has been developing contingency plans to return to financial health without help from other airlines.
"It isn't a cause for concern," he told Dow Jones Newswires.
PAL will submit a plan to the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission by Dec 7, the carrier's deadline for finding a way to make good on some U.S. dlrs 2.1 billion in debts that now are going unpaid, Aquino said.
Early Wednesday, Cathay had expressed dissatisfaction over the talks with PAL, saying it was "not willing to continue negotiations with PAL in its current form."
"We're very sad.
We tried very hard to make it work," Peter Foster, Cathay's regional manager for the Philippines and Taiwan, told The Associated Press.
Foster said the negotiations have been going on for six weeks.
PAL earlier accepted a preliminary investment offer from Cathay Pacific, and the companies announced Nov 10 that they would draw up a comprehensive plan to rehabilitate PAL.
Estrada's executive secretary, Ronaldo Zamora, earlier said PAL's chairman and chief stockholder, Lucio Tan, had gone to the United States to try to resume negotiations with Northwest Airlines, one of PAL's prospective investors.
PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept 23 after failing to persuade its largest union to accept a management proposed recovery plan under which their collective bargaining agreement would be suspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of the company.
The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL to resume domestic and international flights in early October.
PAL says it is unable to pay all its debts due to mounting losses worsened by its labor problems and Asia's currency crisis.
Philippine Airlines said Thursday it will attempt to rebuild alone after Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airlines pulled out of talks on acquiring a stake in the ailing Philippine flag carrier.
PAL had hoped for an infusion of capital from another airline to keep it afloat and help it resume payments on dlrs 2.1 billion in debt.
Manolo Aquino, PAL's executive vice president, said the airline has prepared a "stand alone" rehabilitation plan it will submit next Monday to Manila's Securities and Exchange Commission.
"It does not provide for a foreign airline partner but if there is one in the future, that will be an enhancement," he said in a statement.
Aquino said the plan includes the retention of 22 aircraft down from 54 and the restructuring of debt.
Cathay Pacific announced Wednesday that it has withdrawn its bid to pour up to dlrs 100 million into PAL because of "certain issues which could not be resolved."
Philippine officials said Cathay Pacific and PAL disagreed over who would manage PAL and how many of the more than 8000 employees would lose their jobs.
PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept 23 after failing to persuade its largest union to accept a management proposed recovery plan under which their collective bargaining agreement would be suspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of the company.
The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL to resume domestic and international flights.
Aquino said he welcomed a statement by President Joseph Estrada earlier Thursday that Cathay Pacific is still willing to negotiate with PAL.
"Cathay management wrote me a letter that they are still available for another negotiation," Estrada said.
"So let us not lose hope."
Estrada said he is awaiting the return from abroad of PAL Chairman Lucio Tan to determine if the talks can resume.
During the PAL shutdown, Cathay flew chartered domestic flights at the request of Estrada.
"We also owe it to Cathay," Estrada said.
"When I asked them to help ,they responded.
This in one way or another solved the problems of so many businesses that were affected.
So I think I can talk it over with them."
PAL says it is unable to make payments on its debts because of mounting losses worsened by labor problems and Asia's currency crisis.
President Joseph Estrada said Saturday the financially troubled Philippine Airlines will resume its international flights on Sunday by flying him to Singapore where he will address the World Economic Forum.
Debt laden PAL reopened Wednesday with domestic flights after a 13 day shutdown caused by disagreements with its largest labor union over a management recovery plan.
Speaking over his weekly radio program, Estrada also said Cathay Pacific and Northwest Airlines were interested in investing in the national carrier.
"It's either of the two," he said.
Earlier this week, Peter Foster, a regional manager of Cathay, said the company would soon decide whether to invest in PAL.
Foster said Cathay is "taking a very close look" at PAL but declined to comment what they have found or what stake they are considering.
PAL officials say Singapore Airlines is also interested in a possible investment.
PAL, which has been unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion in debt, was devastated by a pilots' strike in June and by the region's currency crisis, which reduced passenger numbers and inflated costs.
Estrada brokered an agreement between PAL majority owner and chairman, Lucio Tan, and its largest union that led to the reopening of the 57 year old airline.
Under the accord, workers will suspend their collective bargaining agreement for 10 years in exchange for 20 percent ownership of the airline.
Leftist labor leaders say the agreement violates workers' rights and called Estrada anti union.
The visit to Singapore would be Estrada's first foreign trip as president.
He will deliver the keynote address to the 7th East Asia Economic Summit sponsored by the World Economic Forum on Tuesday.
Estrada will also hold talks with Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, Singaporean business leaders and members of the Filipino community.
Estrada said he is scheduled to hold a "getting to know you" meeting with Indonesian President B. J. Habibie on Tuesday on Indonesia's Batam Island south of Singapore.
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said the discussions between the two leaders may include immigration and refugee problems near the two countries' common borders, as well as fishing and rights to other natural resources in the area.
MANILA, Philippines Christmas is a sacred holiday in the Philippines, and nowhere is that more evident than at the headquarters of Philippine Airlines.
Religious statues adorn executive offices, and signs throughout the building announce a holiday mass in the main lobby.
In these dark days, when its frazzled executives are struggling to keep the airline afloat, a mass seems entirely appropriate: One cannot help thinking that what the airline needs is divine intervention.
With $2.2 billion in debt, plunging revenues, and losses of close to $1 million a day, Asia's oldest airline, known as PAL, is in desperate shape.
When negotiations for Cathay Pacific Airways to acquire a stake collapsed earlier this month, several analysts said the airline's options were running out.
"The rescue effort is not just huge, it is astronomical," said Nicholas Ionides, a Singapore based editor of Air Transport Intelligence, a news agency that covers the industry.
"The question is, Do you keep an airline like this alive for pride reasons?
My opinion is that they should just shut it down."
But Philippine Airlines is not just another shipwreck of a company.
It is the nation's flag carrier, a state company until after the ouster of Ferdinand Marcos, when it was spun off to a group of investors led by Lucio Tan, an ethnic Chinese who traded on his ties to Marcos to amass one of the greatest fortunes in the Philippines.
The airline is now the crown jewel in Tan's empire.
Tan is a leading supporter of the new president of the Philippines, Joseph Estrada, not only contributing to his campaign but giving him the use of his planes.
When a labor dispute prompted Tan to shut down the 57 year old airline in September, provoking tears from nostalgic Filipinos, it was Estrada who brokered an agreement that got the planes flying again.
"For Estrada, it's a mark of political prestige to save the airline, and Lucio Tan knows it," said Alexander Magno, president of the Foundation for Economic Freedom, a research organization in Manila.
In the murky world of Asian business, where friendships often count more than solvency, Philippine Airlines would seem to be the classic candidate for a government bailout.
The catch is that Estrada, wanting foreign investors to view the Philippines as having a level playing field, has ruled out injecting any public money.
As the losses pile up, though, Philippine Airlines will be an acid test for this movie star turned politician, who has been in office for six months.
Estrada, 61, may find it hard not to help a friend in need, even if it reinforces the image of the Philippines as a den of crony capitalism.
"It's going to be very tough for Estrada," said Christian Monzad, former chairman of the Philippine Election Commission and a consultant to the Lopez Group, a Filipino conglomerate.
"He is very loyal to his friends, and he would like to repay his political debts."
Estrada's decision will be watched carefully in other Asian capitals, which are grappling with similar issues.
In Indonesia, the government has refused to aid companies with ties to its fallen president, Suharto.
But in Malaysia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has continued to pump public money into private companies.
In the spartan offices of Philippine Airlines, senior executives insist they can go it alone.
On Dec 7, they submitted a rehabilitation plan to the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission that would turn PAL from a sprawling national airline into a compact carrier focused on profitable routes.
The airline said it would prune its fleet, which was aggressively expanded in the years leading up to the Asian economic crisis, to 22 planes from 57.
It would cut its domestic routes to 17 from 36 and its international routes to 13 from 26, among the routes lost would be those to Los Angeles and San Francisco.
The loss of routes has eroded some fond traditions here.
Philippine Airlines used to ferry home for the holidays scores of Filipinos who work abroad often at cut rate fares it can no longer afford.
On a recent afternoon, hundreds of Filipinos from North America streamed into Manila via Hong Kong on Cathay Pacific.
"I think we have a very good chance of rehabilitating this airline, although we need the support of the major stakeholders," said Jaime Bautista, chief financial officer of Philippine Airlines.
The trouble is, the finances do not add up.
The airline says it needs $150 million in fresh capital to overhaul its operations and begin paying off its debt.
Tan and other shareholders will come up with $90 million, and the rest would come from new investors.
After the collapse of the talks with Cathay Pacific, analysts said they doubted that Philippine Airlines would find a white knight.
Bautista conceded that the carrier was not talking to any other airlines, though he has retained Chase Manhattan Bank to scour the world for potential partners.
In the meantime, Bautista said, he saw nothing wrong with the government throwing the airline a few favors.
"A national flag carrier is very important to a country," said Bautista, an amiable man whose punishing work schedule has made him look a good deal older than his 41 years.
"Governments have always been there to help."
Tan declined to be interviewed.
But Bautista said the airline deserved help because his boss had been treated unfairly by the government.
In truth, Tan's experience is more a case of ending up on the wrong side of history.
Under the Marcos regime, he made a fortune in the cigarette and beer businesses in no small part through government tax breaks.
But after Marcos was ousted in 1986, Tan got a chillier reception from his successors, Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos.
The now 64 year old tycoon was hit with a $1 billion tax evasion lawsuit that was finally dismissed by the Supreme Court in 1996.
And he no longer enjoyed preferential treatment.
None of this stopped Tan from adding to his empire.
He first invested in Philippine Airlines in 1992 and won control in 1996.
But Ramos, who was intent on privatizing the economy, opened the industry to competition, licensing rivals like Air Philippines, Cebu Pacific and Grand Air.
Bautista said the new airlines competed with Philippine Airlines on profitable routes, like flights to the resort island of Cebu.
But the government required the airline to continue serving money losing "missionary routes" outposts in this vast archipelago where the planes often fly empty.
Bautista said the government also allowed foreign carriers to increase flights to Manila, enabling them to undercut PAL's fares.
Last week the airline asked the Estrada administration to cut back the flights open to foreign carriers to pre Ramos levels.
Edgardo Espiritu, the finance secretary, said the government would probably grant the request to reverse the "unhealthy actions" of the previous administration.
Magno of the Foundation for Economic Freedom said these protections "would restore PAL to monopoly status."
The government is not stopping there.
Espiritu has asked several government affiliated banks to make bridge loans to Philippine Airlines.
The president of the Philippine National Bank, which is already owed $81 million by the airline, has resisted the idea.
But the government is the bank's largest shareholder, with a 45 percent stake, so he may have little choice.
Still, it is not clear that cash alone will solve the problem.
Analysts said Philippine Airlines was being choked by a bloated payroll.
The airline has trimmed its ranks from 12986 employees to 8589 since May.
But industry experts said it would have to cut that to 2000 to compete with more efficient carriers like Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airlines.
"When you've got too many employees sitting around, they get into other problems they go on strike, they organize unions," said Jim Eckes, an aviation consultant at Indoswiss Ltd. in Hong Kong.
Indeed, a strike by employees precipitated the airline's near death experience in September, when Tan shut down the carrier after its unions refused to accept a drastic cost cutting plan.
After two weeks of frantic mediation by Estrada, the unions voted to give up a collective bargaining agreement in return for a 20 percent stake in the airline and three board seats.
The agreement gave Tan some breathing room to cut the payroll.
But Eckes said it would be politically untenable to trim enough workers to make it genuinely competitive.
And hacking away at costs does not erase the carrier's debt load, which, at $2.2 billion, is larger than its estimated break up value of $1.6 billion.
The airline's creditors which include local and foreign banks, plus export import banks in the United States and Europe must approve the rescue plan.
But short of a nasty battle over the airline's planes, they do not have a better option.
Two questions now hang over Philippine Airlines.
The first is whether it is really worth saving.
Some analysts contend that other carriers already serve the most critical domestic and international routes, and that a new airline without PAL's baggage could soon claim the mantle of flag carrier.
"If you are nonemotional about it, there is no loss," said David Sherman, a consultant who specializes in transportation at A.T. Kearney in Hong Kong.
"If you are emotional about it, this is a tragedy."
The second question is: Can Philippine Airlines be saved with Tan?
In the negotiations with Cathay Pacific, he refused to relinquish control, which ultimately doomed the talks.
Bautista said Tan was willing to hand over day to day operations but insisted on retaining control of the board.
Industry experts said no investor would put up money to revive the airline unless it gained control.
Perhaps the one person who could ease Tan out of the cockpit is Estrada.
But in an interview last month, Estrada seemed more intent on praising Tan than on prodding him.
"We have to admire Lucio Tan," he said, "because in spite of losing big money, I was able to prevail upon him to continue losing money."
And how was the president able to do that?
"He has attained his goal as a billionaire," Estrada replied solemnly.
"Maybe before he leaves the world, he wants to do something for his country."
The Philippine government is ready to give up its stake in ailing Philippine Airlines and will not infuse any additional capital if a new investor, possibly Cathay Pacific Airways, comes in, officials said Tuesday.
"Our objective is full privatization.
The government's policy is to be out of the company that is being privatized," Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said.
The government owns 14 percent of PAL, mostly held by public financial institutions, pension funds and the defense forces.
PAL is negotiating with Cathay Pacific, which could buy up to 40 percent of the airline under Philippine law.
Cathay Pacific has said it wants management control of the Philippine flag carrier, which has been mired in debt and labor unrest.
A PAL official has said it is willing to give Cathay Pacific management control.
Several Manila newspapers reported Tuesday that Cathay Pacific also is demanding that the government divest its shareholdings in PAL before it will agree to conclude a deal with the airline.
PAL executive vice president Manolo Aquino said there was no such demand, adding that the government's shares in PAL will naturally be diluted once a deal is forged and Cathay Pacific puts in new capital.
President Joseph Estrada said he would agree to any setup in PAL as long as it remains the country's flag carrier.
"As long as PAL continues and as long as it remains the flag carrier of the country, so be it," he said.
PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion in debt after being devastated by a pilots' strike and by Asia's currency crisis.
PAL shut down its operations on Sept 23 after the ground crew union turned down a management proposed recovery plan that included a 10 year suspension of labor's collective bargaining agreement in exchange for 20 percent ownership of the airline.
Workers agreed to accept the plan nearly two weeks after the shutdown, and the airline resumed domestic flights Oct 7 and international flights to the United States on Oct 26.
PAL is to resume flights to Hong Kong and Tokyo on Wednesday.
It plans to restart flights to Singapore, Taipei, Fukuoka and Osaka in the next few weeks.
Fearing an embarrassing low turnout in a key election Friday, senior conservative clerics fervently urged Iranians to vote in large numbers to show confidence in the 19 year old Islamic regime.
The hard line controlled state Tehran radio spent half its hour long main news program Thursday broadcasting calls for people to show their "brave presence" at polling stations to elect the Assembly of Experts.
Besides the presidential polls, the election for the 86 member assembly is the most important in Iran because the caucus elects and supervises the country's supreme leader, who has the final say in government decisions.
Among those urging people to vote was Grand Ayatollah Kazem Lankarani, who called it a "divine duty" and warned that "the revolution's enemies are waiting to strike a strong blow at our regime."
Despite the urging, the lackluster election campaign has failed to draw much excitement because of lack of competition: most of the 161 candidates all clergymen are hard liners who were selected by a supervisory Council of Guardians controlled by conservatives.
In vetting 396 aspirants, the council eliminated most supporters of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate clergyman with wide popular support.
Khatami's followers want to make the supreme leader more accountable to the people while the hard liners prefer a much more hands off approach.
The conflict is the latest chapter in a pervasive power struggle in the ruling clergy between Khatami and conservative clergymen who control most of the major state institutions such as the judiciary and security agencies.
Since his elections last year, Khatami has stunned the hard liners with bold and popular attempts to ease social, political and media restrictions that were imposed after the 1979 Islamic Revolution installed the government of theologians.
By eliminating the moderates for Friday's assembly election, the conservatives were hoping to prevent a repeat of the stinging defeat in 1997 presidential election when 20 million out of 30 million people voted for Khatami against a hard line rival.
But then the hard liners began to fear a low turnout would look bad after some moderate groups decided to boycott the vote to protest the dumping of moderate candidates as well as to call into question the legitimacy of the conservatives.
Other moderates believe that people must vote to at least keep the most stringent hard liners out of the assembly, such as Mohammad Yazdi, head of the judiciary, and Ahmad Jannati, head of the Council of Guardians.
The moderates also do not want their candidates few as they are to suffer because of a low turnout.
Candidates linked to the moderate camp include former President Hashemi Rafsanjani and Parliament member Majid Ansari, 44, who wants the assembly to submit regular reports of its work and to open its sessions to public.
Fewer than 10 million of a little more than 38 million eligible voters are expected to take part.
Even the hard line Abrar daily estimated that 15 million people will vote, a turnout of 39 percent.
Hoping to save the day, Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued his final appeal Wednesday.
"The people, by their huge turnout at the elections of the Assembly of Experts will inject a new life into the revolution," he said.
Some 100000 security forces will be deployed around the country's 28 provinces for the voting in 33312 polling stations.
First official results are not expected until Saturday.
Conservative Muslim clerics were leading in national elections for a key assembly that elects and oversees Iran's supreme leader, according to partial results Saturday.
The trend offered no surprise since most of the 167 candidates in Friday' elections were hard liners who want to maintain the authority of the supreme leader, the country's top Shiite cleric who has the final say in all matters.
The Election Committee announced the names of winners for 17 of the 86 seats in the Assembly of Experts.
Their affiliations were not given but judging by their background it was clear that at least 11 of the victors are hard liners and four are moderates.
Two are believed to be independents.
The committee said the 17 victors represent 12 of the country's 28 provinces.
It said counting is underway for 69 remaining seats in 16 more provinces.
Final results are not expected until Sunday.
The elections were marked by a low turnout, and many Iranians said they stayed away to protest the lack of choice: a conservative council that vetted a list of 396 prospective candidates had rejected all but about 30 moderate candidates.
The moderates, led by popular President Mohammad Khatami, want to make the supreme leader more accountable to people by installing an assembly that is more balanced in its composition.
They also favor greater social, political and media freedom than allowed by the established clergy owing allegiance to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
These theologians, who control most crucial state institutions such as the judiciary and security agencies, cite the ideals of the 1979 Islamic Revolution that was led by Khamenei's predecessor, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Saturday that 51 percent of eligible voters cast their ballot in 12 provinces where counting has been completed.
Nationwide, 40 percent of the 38.5 million electorate voted, the independent Salam newspaper said quoting sources the Interior Ministry.
The official media on Friday claimed an "unprecedented" participation by voters.
The Election Committee said a record 64.35 percent voter turnout was noted in Golestan province.
Golestan residents, contacted by telephone, disputed that.
"The stations were empty.
How those ballots got there, I have no idea," said Parvin, who would only give her first name.
She was reached by telephone in Gorgan, capital of Golestan.
She said she visited several polling stations and found very few people voting.
Associated Press reporters who toured polling stations in Tehran Friday also found many of them deserted.
An opposition Iranian group in exile, the National Council of Resistance in Iran, claimed that only about 10 percent of the electorate voted.
"So extensive was the boycott that the ruling clerics were speaking of religiously sanctioned rigging," the NCRI said in a statement issued in Washington and faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo, Egypt.
It said authorities stuffed ballot boxes and the regime planned to announce a turnout several times the actual figure.
There was no independent confirmation of the claim and voters in Iran did not openly complain of rigging.
Iran's conservatives won a decisive victory in elections for a clergy based assembly that oversees the country's supreme leader, official results showed Sunday.
The results came as no surprise since most moderates had been dropped from the ballot in advance of Friday's election by a council that reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by hard liners.
The results showed that only about 18 million of the 38.5 million eligible voters had bothered to cast ballots.
Thousands of pro democracy demonstrators rallied in a Tehran park Sunday to protest the rejection of scores of candidates for the election of a powerful assembly.
The Council of Guardians, which is dominated by political hard liners, has rejected 214 candidates out of 400 who wanted to run in Friday's election to the 86 member Assembly of Experts.
Many of the disqualified candidates were supporters of President Mohammad Khatami, a political moderate.
Twelve candidates withdrew their names in protest against the screening.
The move by the 12 member Council of Guardians is seen as part of the struggle between conservatives and reformists in Iran.
Khatami went on national television late Saturday to criticize the selection of the candidates for the assembly, which has the power to appoint or dismiss Iran's supreme leader.
"There is no doubt that the number of wise and learned scholars suitable for membership of the Assembly of Experts is greater than the 400 or so candidates who have registered," the president said.
In a reference to expectations of a low turnout, Khatami said that greater variety among the candidates would have increased public enthusiasm for the polls.
Khatami said the council could be criticized for "not creating the climate and conditions which would have attracted eligible individuals to enter the scene."
"We should not prevent people from criticizing the components of the system, the institutions, the president, the Council of Guardians, the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the judiciary," Khatami said.
The council has rejected criticism, saying its sole criteria for judging candidates was the law.
Candidates have to take a test on Islamic theology.
In Tehran's Laleh Park on Sunday, thousands turned out to hear Heshmatollah Tabarzadi, a fiery student leader who spoke of the councilors that vetoed his own candidacy in Friday's polls.
"They have created a situation where a section of society will not be taking part in the elections because qualified candidates have been rejected, depriving a section of society from exercising their rights," Tabarzadi said.
Iran's official media boasted about a huge turnout in elections Friday for the council that oversees the country's supreme leader.
But many polling stations were nearly empty in Tehran, the capital and largest city and where some voters complained that hard line clerics had already decided the outcome.
State controlled Tehran radio reported "unprecedented and unique" voting levels for the 86 member Assembly of Experts.
The radio said long lines of voters queued at polling stations across the country, and electoral officers expected to run out of ballot papers.
But correspondents who visited a dozen polling stations around the capital found turnout to be minimal.
Only two polling stations had voters waiting in line.
The electoral authorities twice extended closing the polls for a total of three hours.
Interior Minister Abdolvahed Lari also said late voters would not be turned away.
Candidate Majid Ansari, a moderate cleric, blamed the low turnout in Tehran on the lack of choice as most of the 167 candidates all clergymen were hard liners.
The candidates were selected by a Council of Guardians that is controlled by conservatives.
"Unfortunately, the procedures were such that competition was limited and a group of revolutionaries were prevented from taking part in the elections," Ansari told The Associated Press.
Ordinary people were blunt about their reason for boycotting the polls.
"It makes no difference.
They have already selected the people they want to put in the assembly," said Siavash Mohseni, 24, a university student who didn't vote.
A young woman who gave only her first name, Arezou, said she was also alienated from the polls.
"The behavior of the Council of Guardians was very insulting because they did not give us a chance to choose the candidates of our choice," she said.
Although voting was supposed to be secret, there were no private booths for voters and it was easy to see whom a person voted for.
An election observer in western Tehran said many voters had cast empty ballot papers and many more had voted for supporters of the moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
However, a voter in Tehran's Enqelab Square, Saeid Kazami, 41, said he had cast his ballot mainly for hard line candidates because they "are protectors of the (Islamic) revolution."
"We know that the revolution will have no problem if they are in charge," he said.
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a hard liner, has the final say in government, and conservative clerics want to keep it that way.
But moderate clerics, led by Khatami, are calling for a more accountable leader.
Khatami's efforts to ease the revolution's social, political and media restrictions are popular.
But they are opposed bitterly by hard liners who are loathe to give up control of key institutions such as the judiciary and the security agencies.
Khatami urged people to vote after casting his ballot at the Husseinieh Jamaran mosque in northern Tehran.
"Definitely, there could have been more qualified people than were allowed, but nonetheless we still have a chance to choose our favored candidates," Khatami told reporters.
Official results are not expected until Saturday, and Tehran's results could be announced as late as Sunday, electoral authorities said.
Iran's conservatives won a decisive victory in elections for a clergy based assembly that oversees the country's supreme leader, official results showed Sunday.
The results were expected since most moderates had been dropped from the ballot in advance of Friday's election by a council that reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by hard liners.
The hard liners won at least 54 places on the 86 seat Assembly of Experts and the moderates only 13. Sixteen seats went to candidates whose political affiliation was unclear but who probably lean toward the hard line camp and three to declared independents, who are believed to be closer to the moderates.
The outcome is a blow to moderates who had hoped to use the Assembly of Experts to curb the absolute powers of the supreme leader and broaden social and political freedoms for the average Iranian.
In the capital, Tehran, moderate former President Hashemi Rafsanjani led the polls with 1682882 votes.
Behind him was hard liner Ali Meshkini, the current head of the Assembly of Experts, with 1240524 votes.
Hard liners won 11 of the 16 seats in Tehran and moderates only five.
Among the hard liners who won in the capital were Mohammad Yazdi, head of the powerful judiciary, and Ahmad Jannati, who leads the council that vetted the candidates.
The results showed that only about 18 million of the 38.5 million eligible voters had bothered to cast ballots.
The official media had reported crowded polling stations and a massive turnout, but visits to Tehran stations showed many nearly empty and calls to other parts of the country produced similar reports.
Many Iranians said they stayed away to protest the dropping of most progressive theologians by the conservative dominated Council of Guardians.
The council reviewed a list of 396 applicants and allowed only 167 to run.
Friday's voter turnout was in sharp contrast to last year's presidential elections, when some 30 million cast ballots, 20 million of whom voted for President Mohammad Khatami, who has presented the biggest challenge to the conservatives since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Some moderate leaders had said in advance they did not expect to win the balloting but still hoped to use the assembly to focus on the growing powers granted to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's top Shiite Muslim cleric.
The hard liners want to maintain Khamenei's absolute authority and have battled Khatami's efforts to grant more freedom to the press and the arts and reduce Islamic strictures on the average citizen.
Conservative Muslim clerics were leading in national elections for a key assembly that elects and oversees Iran's supreme leader, according to partial results Saturday.
The trend offered no surprise since most of the 167 candidates in Friday' elections were hard liners who want to maintain the authority of the supreme leader, the country's top Shiite cleric who has the final say in all matters.
The Election Committee announced the names of winners for 17 of the 86 seats in the Assembly of Experts.
Their affiliations were not given but judging by their background it was clear that at least 11 of the victors are hard liners and four are moderates.
Two are believed to be independents.
The committee said the 17 victors represent 12 of the country's 28 provinces.
It said counting is underway for 69 remaining seats in 16 more provinces.
Final results are not expected until Sunday.
The elections were marked by a low turnout, and many Iranians said they stayed away to protest the lack of choice: a conservative council that vetted a list of 396 prospective candidates had rejected all but about 30 moderate candidates.
The moderates, led by popular President Mohammad Khatami, want to make the supreme leader more accountable to people by installing an assembly that is more balanced in its composition.
They also favor greater social, political and media freedom than allowed by the established clergy owing allegiance to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
These theologians, who control state institutions such as the judiciary and security agencies, cite the ideals of the 1979 Islamic Revolution that was led by Khamenei's predecessor, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Saturday that 51 percent of eligible voters cast their ballot in 12 provinces where counting has been completed.
Nationwide, 40 percent of the 38.5 million electorate voted, the independent Salam newspaper said quoting sources the Interior Ministry.
The official media on Friday claimed an "unprecedented" participation by voters.
The Election Committee said a record 64.35 percent voter turnout was noted in Golestan province.
Golestan residents, contacted by telephone, disputed that.
"The stations were empty.
How those ballots got there, I have no idea," said Parvin, who would only give her first name.
She was reached by telephone in Gorgan, capital of Golestan.
She said she visited several polling stations and found very few people voting.
Associated Press reporters who toured polling stations in Tehran Friday also found many of them deserted.
An opposition Iranian group in exile, the National Council of Resistance in Iran, claimed that only about 10 percent of the electorate voted.
"So extensive was the boycott that the ruling clerics were speaking of religiously sanctioned rigging," the NCRI said in a statement issued in Washington and faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo, Egypt.
It said authorities stuffed ballot boxes and the regime planned to announce a turnout several times the actual figure.
There was no independent confirmation of the claim and voters in Iran did not openly complain of rigging.
Iranians voted Friday to elect a key assembly expected to be dominated by hard line clergymen who favor unhindered powers for Iran's supreme leader.
The state controlled media reported an "unprecedented and unique" turnout but gave no figures.
However, Associated Press reporters found many polling stations empty and others with few voters.
Friday's election is for the 86 seat Assembly of Experts, whose job is to oversee the work of the supreme leader, a post currently held by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
In practice, the supreme leader has the final say in all matters and hard line clergymen want to keep it that way.
But moderate clerics led by President Mohammad Khatami are calling for a more accountable leader in a political tug of war that has gripped Iran since his election last year.
"We want to have a say in our destiny," said Farhad Qaemaqami, who waited with about 30 others to vote at a mosque in the upscale Fereshteh neighborhood.
"I will vote for somebody who will have some kind of influence over the (supreme) leader."
But Khatami's camp appeared to have lost this battle even before the polls: a conservative supervisory council that vetted a list of 396 prospective candidates approved 161 contestants, only about 30 of them moderates.
Khatami, who was among the early voters, pointed that out to reporters after casting his ballot in the Husseinieh Jamaran meeting hall attached to a mosque in northern Tehran.
"Definitely, there could have been more qualified people than were allowed, but nonetheless we still have a chance to choose our favored candidates," said Khatami, who drove to the polling booth dressed in the clergy's black robe and turban.
He shook hands and chatted with election officials before sitting in front of a white ballot box to pick a 16 man panel for the Tehran district from a list of 32 candidates.
Tehran radio said people queued in long lines to vote and authorities expect to run out of ballot papers.
"People voted for Islam," the radio said.
"People's participation is unprecedented and unique."
In Bojnourd and Astaneh Ashrafiyeh cities in the north, people braved heavy rains and strong winds to stand in long lines at polling stations, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said.
The upbeat reports contrasted with predictions of low voter turnout from a disappointed public that had little to choose from, unlike in the 1997 presidential polls when 20 million people voted for the reformist Khatami.
A hard line newspapers had said only about 39 percent of the 38 million eligible voters are expected to show up for Friday's vote.
"They are all liars.
I am powerless to do anything against them so it's best to keep quiet," said Siavaash Mohseni, 24, a university student who said he didn't vote.
"They have already selected the people they want to put in the assembly."
A low turnout would likely be seen as a rebuff of the hard line policies of Khamenei, who succeeded the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution that installed the rule of Shiite clergy in Iran.
Khatami's popular efforts to ease the revolution's social, political and media restrictions are opposed bitterly by hard liners loathe to give up control over Iran's judiciary, security agencies and other key institutions.
Voting in the 33312 polling stations in the country's 28 provinces is scheduled to close at 6 p.m. (1430 GMT).
First official results are not expected until Saturday.

A panel investigating apartheid era atrocities said Wednesday it will not implicate the last apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, in human rights abuses after he threatened a court challenge.
De Klerk said he would sue to block the long awaited final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was due for release Thursday.
The man who helped negotiate the end of apartheid objected to a finding by the commission that he was "an accessory after the fact" to bombings in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church group and of a labor federation.
Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the truth panel's chairman, said the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge, and would "excise" de Klerk's name from the report to avoid delaying its release.
"It upsets me deeply," Tutu said.
"We have been scrupulously fair to Mr de Klerk and we reject the contention that we have been engaged in a vendetta against him.
"But we must and will respect the courts and his rights under the constitution.
We fought hard for those rights and we can be proud in South Africa that Mr de Klerk now shares in them," he said in a statement.
"All we are doing is postponing dealing with the matter," Tutu later told The Associated Press.
"The name will eventually appear after all the hoo ha has died down."
De Klerk, reached in London, said he could not comment before speaking with his lawyers because the matter was in the courts.
The commission was charged with promoting reconciliation by laying bare apartheid's horrors.
It has held hearings around the country for more than two years, listening to victims and perpetrators seeking amnesty.
The release of the 3500 page report represents a milestone for South Africa's transformation from white minority rule to democracy.
De Klerk's challenge was only part of the storm of criticism prompted by leaks of the report.
The African National Congress, the liberation movement that helped defeat apartheid and now runs the country, on Tuesday angrily rejected a finding that it too was guilty of human rights violations in its armed struggle.
The report will be a broad and detailed summary of South Africa's human rights history, from 1960 to 1994, when all race elections ended white minority rule.
It will parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual prosecutions.
Other threatened legal challenges have led to fewer individuals being named as rights violators than planned, The Star of Johannesburg reported Wednesday.
In commenting on the newspaper report, Tutu said that more than 400 people had been notified they would be implicated to give them a chance to respond.
Only 15 successfully argued themselves out of the report, he said.
A panel probing apartheid era abuses has accused the African National Congress of human rights violations, including torture and bomb attacks, the state broadcaster said Monday.
The ANC, which led the struggle against white rule and now is in power, previously has acknowledged it was told to expect implication in right violations.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will release its final report on 2 1 2 years of investigation on Thursday.
The report was expected to place overwhelming blame for the era's abuses on white governments and their brutal security services.
President Nelson Mandela's office received an advance copy on Monday ahead of the handover ceremony, when retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who chaired the comission, will present Mandela with the report.
South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said it had been leaked a "preliminary document" which condemns the ANC as politically and morally responsible for gross human rights violations during and after the fall of apartheid.
An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said he believed the news report referred to a commission letter sent in advance "informing us of its intention to implicate the ANC in gross human rights violations."
Commission officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
Justice Minister Dullah Omar told journalists in Pretoria he had heard the news report, but would not comment.
Former President F.W. de Klerk, meanwhile, plans to ask a court to prevent the Truth Commission report from implicating him in covering up state sponsored terror.
"Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court," Omar said, but added he would "regret" any court ordered delay.
The ANC was nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with commissioners earlier this month.
The panel refused, to avoid appearing embarrassed.
The party says the accusations against it likely would center on the planting of land mines on border farms, abuses at its military camps in Angola and bombings.
Omar said he expected the report's conclusions to set off debate but added it would "lay the basis for reconciliation."
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa Facing a court challenge, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission said Wednesday that it would withhold, at least temporarily, the parts of its final report that implicate South Africa's last apartheid era president, F.W. de Klerk, in illegal acts.
De Klerk, 62, who helped negotiate the end of South Africa's white supremacist government and shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with President Nelson Mandela for that work, had objected to a finding by the commission that he was "an accessory after the fact" in the bombings of the headquarters of a church group and of a labor federation in the 1980s.
The chairman of the 17 member panel, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said that although he took such action with "great reluctance," the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge.
He said it would take de Klerk's name out of 3500 page report to avoid delaying its release Thursday.
"It upsets me deeply," he said in a statement.
"We have been scrupulously fair to de Klerk, and we reject the contention that we have been engaged in a vendetta against him."
De Klerk's challenge was only part of the storm of criticism prompted by leaks about the report in the last few days.
Within hours of the commission decision to withdraw its findings on de Klerk, it was facing the possibility of a new suit this time from the ruling African National Congress.
The ANC also wants to block the commission findings about its conduct during the liberation struggle.
A spokesman for the party, Thabo Masebe, said the party would seek an injunction in the morning before the report is officially handed over to Mandela.
While the commission's report is expected to lay overwhelming blame on the former white government for atrocities, it has also found the ANC responsible for human rights violations, including the torture and killing of spying suspects, bombings in civilian areas and the killing of political enemies, including members of the rival Zulu based Inkhata Freedom Party.
The decision on de Klerk seems certain to damage the commission's credibility.
The panel, created as a way of putting South Africa's brutal past to rest without the expense and political divisiveness of trials, has caused controversy from the start.
It has held more than 160 hearings throughout the country, listening to both victims and to perpetrators seeking amnesty.
But many whites say the commission is on a witch hunt aiming to humiliate former government officials and Afrikaners in general.
De Klerk has once before forced the commission officials to court and won an apology from them for calling him a liar.
Some political analysts said Wednesday's events would only further the belief that the panel lacks impartiality.
"The withdrawal of the findings can't help but be seen as a lack of certainty on their side," said Sampie Terreblanche, an economist and political analyst at the University of Stellenbosch, who has supported the commission.
"Whether we like it or not, the whole report gets a knock from this."
De Klerk's spokesman, David Steward, said the former president "was very confident" that he would win when the case goes to trial in March.
"He is very happy to be in the courts now rather than dealing with the Truth Commission," Steward said.
"The fact that they agreed to withdraw creates the definite impression that they specifically concocted a case to involve Mr de Klerk in a negative finding."
The ANC has accused the commission of trying to "criminalize" the liberation struggle.
"Whatever the efforts to besmirch our struggle by denouncing it as a gross violation of human rights," the congress said in a statement.
"The ANC and the millions of people who were part of this struggle will always be proud of what they did to insure that, in the process of the destruction of a vile system, they did not themselves resort to vile methods of struggle on the basis that the means justified the end."
There are probably few subjects that get South Africans more excited than the issue of the Truth Commission and whether it is a worthy cause or a waste of money.
The events of the last few days have only added to the debate.
For some, like Pal Martins, 34, a former member of the ANC's armed wing, the fact all sides of the political spectrum are in an uproar is a good thing.
"The mere fact that everyone is complaining means that the Truth Commission has done its work," he said.
But others say that too many questions are being raised about the panel's competence.
"The whole affair is beyond the pale, a mockery of justice," said Roboy Vonholdt, a 56 year old sheep and ostrich farmer who believes that the commission has been a theatrical act. "We should all turn our backs on the past and move forward.
We need them and they need us.
Let's all make money and let good economic conditions prevail."
The commission's report is supposed to be a broad and detailed summary of South Africa's human rights history, from 1960 to 1994, when elections open to all races ended white minority rule.
It will parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual prosecutions.
While de Klerk was alone in court Wednesday challenging the commission, Tutu said Wednesday that other threatened legal challenges had led to fewer individuals being named as rights violators than originally planned.
Tutu said that more than 400 people had been notified that they would be implicated to give them a chance to respond.
Some 15 successfully argued themselves out of the report or could not be reached and were therefore deleted from the report, he said.
The commission is required by law to give advance notification to anyone it intends to implicate in its report.
The commission had been expected to say that although de Klerk did not order the bombings, he subsequently came to know that former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe had been involved, but failed to report his knowledge to the police.
This could open him up to a criminal prosecution.
De Klerk has not applied for amnesty in this matter or any other.
de Klerk has said that when he learned about the bombings, Vlok and Van der Merwe were already in the process of applying for amnesty, and he did not think it was necessary to report the matter.
Torturers and bombers who carried out atrocities defending or fighting apartheid need counseling to ensure they do not repeat their crimes, an expert for South Africa's reconciliation body said Thursday.
Addressing local and international experts, Charles Villa Vicencio, research head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said ignoring the psychological needs of those who carried out human rights abuses could alienate a potentially dangerous sector of society.
"We must give attention to the healing of perpetrators, not just for the sake of perpetrators, but for the sake of the nation as a whole," he said.
The conference, organized by the Medical Research Council, is examining mental health issues raised by the Truth Commission, which is charged with probing crimes committed by all sides in the anti apartheid struggle.
As the commission prepares to hand over its final report at the end of the month, South Africans are examining its painful and traumatic exploration of their bloody past.
With the power to grant amnesty to many who tortured, bombed or maimed innocent civilians, the process has at some stage angered people in nearly all walks of life.
Many whites see the panel as favoring the black liberation movements, while many blacks accuse it of being too soft on former state officials, especially top ranking ministers.
However, Villa Vicencio appealed for tolerance in dealing with all those who have committed crimes, saying that the potential for wrongdoing existed in everyone.
"We all, the entire human race, carry with us the capacity for evil," he said.
Many of Thursday's speakers touched on the figure of police death squad leader Eugene de Kock, who was given jail terms totaling more than 200 years after a killing spree that costs dozens of lives.
De Kock has applied for amnesty for his crimes.
Dan Stein, a specialist in neurobiology and stress disorders, said de Kock typified many killers from all sides in the conflict by his sheer "banality of evil".
"Many people have found him in interviews to be an ordinary, even likeable person," he said about the man whom subordinates dubbed "Prime Evil."
Ginn Fourie, a physiotherapist whose student daughter was gunned down by black activists in a 1993 attack on a Cape Town bar, said it was necessary to help those whose circumstances compelled them to do wrong.
Struggling to control her tears, Fourie told delegates she had attended the amnesty hearings of her daughter's killers and supported their successful bid to be freed from long jail sentences.
After describing how she hugged the three members of the black nationalist Pan Africanist Congress and urged them to seek counseling together with their victims, Fourie earned a standing ovation from the 50 strong audience.
"We must take the initiative in understanding others and start the process of reconciliation and healing our broken land," she said, her voice shaking with emotion.
The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Nov 1: The 3500 page report of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, released on Thursday, is the most comprehensive and unsparing examination of a nation's ugly past that any such commission has yet produced.
Drawing from the commission's own investigations and the testimony of hundreds of applicants for amnesty and 20000 victims, the report is a detailed look at the crimes of the apartheid era, and blames successive white governments for the vast majority.
It has fulfilled its mandate of telling the fullest truth possible, which is one reason that every political party in South Africa has denounced it.
Besides accusing the government of assassinations and bombings, the report criticizes the Inkatha Freedom Party for its massacres and collaboration with security forces, and blames the African National Congress for the murder of civilians and other crimes.
It singles out former President P.W. Botha, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader, and Winnie Mandela, among others, for detailed treatment of their roles in political crimes.
One major flaw in the report is the absence of a section accusing F.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid president, of knowing about several bombings after the fact and keeping silent.
It was excised because de Klerk is suing the commission.
The ANC also sued, unsuccessfully, to stop publication.
The lawsuits are a disappointing sign that South Africa's political parties are not interested in an honest look at their past, nor in the free flow of information.
The controversy has added to widespread complaints that the commission has not helped the process of reconciliation.
This is wrong.
True reconciliation which occurs when a society is no longer paralyzed by the past and people can work and live together cannot be based on silence.
No society can be restored to health by papering over as much pain as South Africans have suffered.
A noisy and informed debate about complicity in the crimes of the apartheid era is necessary, if uncomfortable.
The report is only part of the Truth Commission's contribution to the healing process.
The hearings themselves, which allowed victims of human rights violations to tell their stories in public, helped the country heal and opened the eyes of many whites to the unpleasant truth about apartheid.
The amnesty process, while permitting many important criminals to escape justice, is allowing families to know exactly what happened to their loved ones in dozens of cases that would likely have never gone to trial in South Africa's fragile judicial system.
The process of helping the victims with scholarships and other necessary aid goes on, although it will not be enough.
No commission can transform a society as twisted as South Africa's was.
But the Truth Commission is the best effort the world has seen, and South Africa is the better for it.
President Nelson Mandela acknowledged Saturday the African National Congress violated human rights during apartheid, setting him at odds with his deputy president over a report that has divided much of South Africa.
The disagreement stems from Thursday's release of the report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on horrors committed during apartheid.
Rather than act as a salve and an aid to reconciliation, the report has caused divisiveness, even among former comrades in arms who fought apartheid.
As expected, the report called apartheid a "crime against humanity."
But it also blamed the ANC for gross human rights violations during its anti apartheid struggle, saying the group tortured suspected spies and dissidents and killed innocent civilians with land mines and bombs.
Some suspected traitors were killed in the ANC's camps abroad.
Mbeki who became ANC president last year and will likely be elected South Africa's next president in 1999 when Mandela retires took a hard line Saturday against the report, and indicated all ANC members must do the same.
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa The deal that South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission offered was simple enough: Confess your crimes, apply for amnesty and you will go free.
If you don't come forward, you will be prosecuted.
After more than two years of hearings into apartheid era atrocities, the commission last week unveiled a 3500 page report naming dozens of people it believes were up to their elbows in the gore but never applied for amnesty.
So the prosecutions should begin soon, right?
Not so fast.
The study was barely in the hands of President Nelson Mandela before talk of new amnesty deals had begun.
It seems that nearly all of South Africa's political parties including the ruling African National Congress have key officials who could end up in the dock because of the report.
Suddenly, there is lots of talk about how the country can't withstand a round of politically divisive trials, and many political analysts here are betting that an agreement "of mutual benefit" is in the offing.
Already, three major political parties are calling for some kind of new amnesty, and the ANC isn't closing the door.
ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said it was "premature" to talk of a general amnesty, but he acknowledged that the party was discussing an amnesty specifically tailored to violence by black South Africans against other blacks that littered the KwaZulu/Natal province with bodies during the late '80s and into the '90s.
In choosing a truth commission rather than a Nuremberg style trial with which to close out its brutal past, South Africa hoped for an idealistic reconciliation.
People would come clean and receive true forgiveness.
Society would then be able to move on, its wounds cleansed and healed.
It was a model watched closely around the world by other societies wondering how to disentangle themselves from the grudges of a brutal past.
But given the chance, hundreds of South Africa's perpetrators did not come forward.
Commission officials themselves say they were frustrated by the lack of cooperation, however exhaustive their report may seem.
It is perhaps too late, however, to press for more.
Today's South Africa has urgent new problems to deal with unemployment, crime, white flight, too few schools and hospitals.
So it may wind up settling for a more pragmatic reconciliation one that gives amnesty to the unrepentant simply because it's more practical for all concerned to move on.
In recent years, truth commissions have gained popularity in many places, notably Chile, Argentina and El Salvador.
But South Africa's the biggest and most powerful, able to grant amnesty and to subpoena witnesses was supposed to be the real test.
Certainly the commission forced the nation to see the gruesome details of its past, as sobbing survivors and stone faced torturers told of smashed genitals and near suffocations.
And the commission's work added much to the knowledge about what happened in South Africa between 1960 and 1994.
But it will be years before the effect of the commission can truly be judged.
Has anyone really forgiven anyone else?
Will vendettas persist?
No one can answer.
One thing seems clear, however: Four years after South Africa held its first non racial elections, a growing number of South Africans want to be done with the past.
Raymond Louw, the publisher of a respected weekly newsletter, Southern Africa Report, says a new amnesty proposal could come up during the February session of Parliament, in time to remove the issue from next year's election campaigns.
"You simply can't have this country torn apart by prosecutions," he says.
"Everybody is going to be howling for an amnesty.
They already are."
Even as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the commission's chairman, delivered the report, he seemed to be anticipating a push for a new amnesty and arguing against it.
He said such a move would be highly unfair to those who came forward.
He suggested instead that there be a two year time limit, after which anyone not indicted would in effect get amnesty.
To be sure, there will be opposition to any proposals to limit prosecutions.
More than a dozen human rights and victims advocacy groups have already banded together to condemn such proposals as "unconscionable."
The idea for a Truth Commission emerged as a compromise from the long negotiations that brought about South Africa's peaceful transition from a white supremacist state to a non racial democracy.
During the talks, the white National Party government pushed for a blanket amnesty, and the ANC refused.
In the end, only about 250 former police officers came forward, most of them foot soldiers.
And only two high National Party officials, former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe, confessed to roles in ordering bombings.
In its report, the commission called the apartheid state the "primary perpetrator" of gross human rights violations and held such high ranking former officials as former President P.W. Botha, his former army chief, Georg Meiring, and the former intelligence chief, Niel Barnard, responsible.
These men, and others of lower rank, have not applied for amnesty For the ANC, the most embarrassing prospect is the possible prosecution of Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela Mandela, who is accused in the report of taking part in a number of assaults and abductions.
Lesser known officials could face charges too.
The ANC is held responsible for at least 76 deaths in KwaZulu/Natal.
The ANC's problems are further complicated by its efforts to make peace with the largely Zulu based Inkatha Freedom Party.
Virtually no one from that party came forward to ask for amnesty.
Yet the report found that Inkatha, working with the white government, was responsible for widespread slaughter in KwaZulu/Natal and in the townships around Johannesburg.
Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and many key party officials stand accused of fomenting a wide range of abuses.
But prosecuting Chief Buthelezi could lead to new warfare in KwaZulu.
Part of the reluctance to go forward with prosecutions may be the result of still another factor: The judicial system is already overwhelmed with rising crime and the evidence from the apartheid era is old.
So why spend the time and the money?
At the moment, only one political party is opposed to any form of new amnesty the tiny but influential Democratic Party, a liberal group that was not involved in the violence.
Its head, Tony Leon, says a new amnesty would only prove that "the more thuglike your behavior, the more you get away with."
But he concedes that his is a lonely voice.
"At this point," he says, "there is little enthusiasm for anything but closing the book on the past."
PRETORIA, South Africa Following are excerpts from the final report issued by South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Thursday: PRIMARY FINDING On the basis of the evidence available to it, the primary finding of the Commission is that: The predominant portion of gross violations of human rights was committed by the former state through its security and law enforcement agencies.
Moreover, the South African state in the period from the late 1970's to early 1990's became involved in activities of a criminal nature when, amongst other things, it knowingly planned, undertook, condoned and covered up the commission of unlawful acts, including the extrajudicial killing of political opponents and others, inside and outside South Africa.
In pursuit of these unlawful activities, the state acted in collusion with certain other political groupings, most notably the Inkatha Freedom Party (I.F.P.), Certain members of the State Security Council (the state President, Minister of Defense, Minister of Law and Order, and heads of security forces) did foresee that the use of words such as "take out," "wipe out," "eradicate," and "eliminate" would result in the killing of political opponents.
They are therefore responsible for deliberate planning which caused gross violations of human rights.
P.W. BOTHA During the period that he presided as head of state (1978 1989) according to submissions made to and findings made by the Commission, gross violations of human rights and other unlawful acts were perpetrated on a wide scale by members of the South African Defense Force, including: The deliberate unlawful killing and attempted killing of persons opposed to the policies of the Government, within and outside South Africa.
The widespread use of torture and other forms of severe ill treatment against such persons.
The forcible abduction of such persons where were resident in neighboring countries.
Covert logistical and financial assistance to organizations opposed to the ideology of the A.N.C. and other liberation movements, INKATHA The Commission finds that in 1986, the South African Defense Forces (S.A.D.F.) conspired with Inkatha to provide the latter with a covert, offensive paramilitary unit (or "hit squad") to be deployed illegally against persons and organizations perceived to be opposed to both the South African Government and Inkatha.
The S.A.D.F. provided training, financial and logistical management and behind the scenes supervision of the trainees, who were trained by the Special Forces unit of the S.A.D.F. in the Caprivi Strip.
The Commission finds furthermore that the deployment of the paramilitary unit in KwaZulu led to gross violations of human rights, including killing, attempted killing and severe ill treatment.
The Commission finds the following people, among others, accountable for such violations: Mr P. W. Botha, Gen. Magnus Malan, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, The A.N.C.
While it was A.N.C. policy that the loss of civilian life should be "avoided," there were instances where members of its security forces perpetrated gross violations of human rights in that the distinction between military and civilian targets was blurred in certain armed actions, such as the 1983 Church Street bombing of the South African Air Force headquarters,In the course of the armed struggle, the A.N.C., through its security forces, undertook military operations which, though intended for military or security force targets, sometimes went awry for a variety of reasons, including poor intelligence and reconnaissance.
The consequences in these cases, such as the Magoo's Bar and Durban Esplanade bombings, were gross violations of human rights in respect of the injuries to and loss of lives of civilians.
Individuals who defected to the state and became informers and/or members who became state witnesses in political trials , were often labeled by the A.N.C. as collaborators and regarded as legitimate targets to be killed.
The commission does not condone the legitimization of such individuals as military targets and finds that the extrajudicial killings of such individuals constituted gross violations of human rights.
The commission finds that, in the 1980's in particular, a number of gross violations were perpetrated not by direct members of the A.N.C. or those operating under its formal command, but by civilians who saw themselves as A.N.C. supporters.
In this regard, the Commission finds that the A.N.C. is morally and politically accountable for creating a climate in which such supporters believed their actions to be legitimate and carried out within the broad parameters of a "people's war" as enunciated by the A.N.C. A.N.C.
CAMPS The Commission finds that suspected "agents" were routinely subjected to torture and other forms of severe ill treatment and that there were cases of such individuals being charged and convicted by tribunals without proper regard to due process, sentenced to death and executed.
WINNIE MADIKIZELA MANDELA The Commission finds that Ms Madikizela Mandela was central to the establishment and formation of the Mandela United Football Club, which later developed into a private vigilante unit.
It is the Commission's view that Ms Madikizela Mandela was aware of the criminal activity and the disquiet it caused in the community, but chose deliberately not to address the problems emanating from the football club.
The Commission finds that those who opposed Ms Madikizela Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club, or dissented from them, were branded as informers and killed.
The Commission finds that Ms Madikizela Mandela ,is accountable, politically and morally for the gross violations of human rights committed by the Mandela United Football Club.
The Commission finds further that Mrs Madikizela Mandela herself was responsible for committing such gross violations of human rights, BUSINESS Business was central to the economy that sustained the South African state during the apartheid years.
Certain businesses, especially the mining industry, were involved in helping design and implement apartheid policies.
The white agriculture industry benefited from its privileged access to land.
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa The deal that South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission offered was simple enough: Confess your crimes, apply for amnesty and you will go free.
If you don't come forward, you will be prosecuted.
After more than two years of hearings into apartheid era atrocities, the commission last week unveiled a 3500 page report naming dozens of people it believes were up to their elbows in the gore but never applied for amnesty.
So the prosecutions should begin soon, right?
Not so fast.
The study was barely in the hands of President Nelson Mandela before talk of new amnesty deals had begun.
It seems that nearly all of South Africa's political parties including the ruling African National Congress have key officials who could end up in the dock because of the report.
Suddenly, there is lots of talk about how the country can't withstand a round of politically divisive trials, and many political analysts here are betting that an agreement "of mutual benefit" is in the offing.
Already, three major political parties are calling for some kind of new amnesty, and the ANC isn't closing the door.
ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said it was "premature" to talk of a general amnesty, but he acknowledged that the party was discussing an amnesty specifically tailored to violence by black South Africans against other blacks that littered the KwaZulu/Natal province with bodies during the late '80s and into the '90s.
In choosing a truth commission rather than a Nuremberg style trial with which to close out its brutal past, South Africa hoped for an idealistic reconciliation.
People would come clean and receive true forgiveness.
Society would then be able to move on, its wounds cleansed and healed.
It was a model watched closely around the world by other societies wondering how to disentangle themselves from the grudges of a brutal past.
But given the chance, hundreds of South Africa's perpetrators did not come forward.
Commission officials themselves say they were frustrated by the lack of cooperation, however exhaustive their report may seem.
It is perhaps too late, however, to press for more.
Today's South Africa has urgent new problems to deal with unemployment, crime, white flight, too few schools and hospitals.
So it may wind up settling for a more pragmatic reconciliation one that gives amnesty to the unrepentant simply because it's more practical for all concerned to move on.
In recent years, truth commissions have gained popularity in many places, notably Chile, Argentina and El Salvador.
But South Africa's the biggest and most powerful, able to grant amnesty and to subpoena witnesses was supposed to be the real test.
Certainly the commission forced the nation to see the gruesome details of its past, as sobbing survivors and stone faced torturers told of smashed genitals and near suffocations.
And the commission's work added much to the knowledge about what happened in South Africa between 1960 and 1994.
But it will be years before the effect of the commission can truly be judged.
Has anyone really forgiven anyone else?
Will vendettas persist?
No one can answer.
One thing seems clear, however: Four years after South Africa held its first non racial elections, a growing number of South Africans want to be done with the past.
Raymond Louw, the publisher of a respected weekly newsletter, Southern Africa Report, says a new amnesty proposal could come up during the February session of Parliament, in time to remove the issue from next year's election campaigns.
"You simply can't have this country torn apart by prosecutions," he says.
"Everybody is going to be howling for an amnesty.
They already are."
Even as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the commission's chairman, delivered the report, he seemed to be anticipating a push for a new amnesty and arguing against it.
He said such a move would be highly unfair to those who came forward.
He suggested instead that there be a two year time limit, after which anyone not indicted would in effect get amnesty.
To be sure, there will be opposition to any proposals to limit prosecutions.
More than a dozen human rights and victims advocacy groups have already banded together to condemn such proposals as "unconscionable."
The idea for a Truth Commission emerged as a compromise from the long negotiations that brought about South Africa's peaceful transition from a white supremacist state to a non racial democracy.
During the talks, the white National Party government pushed for a blanket amnesty, and the ANC refused.
In the end, only about 250 former police officers came forward, most of them foot soldiers.
And only two high National Party officials, former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe, confessed to roles in ordering bombings.
In its report, the commission called the apartheid state the "primary perpetrator" of gross human rights violations and held such high ranking former officials as former President P.W. Botha, his former army chief, Georg Meiring, and the former intelligence chief, Niel Barnard, responsible.
These men, and others of lower rank, have not applied for amnesty For the ANC, the most embarrassing prospect is the possible prosecution of Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela Mandela, who is accused in the report of taking part in a number of assaults and abductions.
Lesser known officials could face charges too.
The ANC is held responsible for at least 76 deaths in KwaZulu/Natal.
The ANC's problems are further complicated by its efforts to make peace with the largely Zulu based Inkatha Freedom Party.
Virtually no one from that party came forward to ask for amnesty.
Yet the report found that Inkatha, working with the white government, was responsible for widespread slaughter in KwaZulu/Natal and in the townships around Johannesburg.
Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and many key party officials stand accused of fomenting a wide range of abuses.
But prosecuting Chief Buthelezi could lead to new warfare in KwaZulu.
Part of the reluctance to go forward with prosecutions may be the result of still another factor: The judicial system is already overwhelmed with rising crime and the evidence from the apartheid era is old.
So why spend the time and the money?
At the moment, only one political party is opposed to any form of new amnesty the tiny but influential Democratic Party, a liberal group that was not involved in the violence.
Its head, Tony Leon, says a new amnesty would only prove that "the more thuglike your behavior, the more you get away with."
But he concedes that his is a lonely voice.
"At this point," he says, "there is little enthusiasm for anything but closing the book on the past."
The institution exploring apartheid's horrors will issue a report that finds the African National Congress shares blame for human rights violations as it struggled to overcome white rule.
The 3500 page report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission culminates more than two years of nationwide hearings.
South African media released preliminary findings on Monday, three days before its official release on Thursday in Pretoria, the capital.
The release of the document is a milestone in South Africa's transformation from white minority rule to democracy.
The commission, which has the power to grant amnesty, was tasked with promoting reconciliation by laying bare the what and why of apartheid era atrocities.
With the ANC now in power and facing an election in mid 1999, a condemnation by the commission could prove damaging both to its electoral chances and moral standing.
There has been no doubt that the report's overwhelming blame would be laid on white governments and their security forces during the years under scrutiny, 1960 1994.
Indeed, news reports Monday said the Truth Commission would declare apartheid a crime against humanity and acknowledge that the ANC and the more radical Pan Africanist Congress were conducting a legitimate struggle against the former apartheid state.
But in preliminary findings sent to the parties last month, the commission also said the two movements were "morally and politically accountable" for gross rights violations, South African Press Association and South African Broadcasting Corp. said.
The preliminary finding said that despite ANC policy against killing civilians, the line between military and civilian targets had been blurred, SAPA said.
It condemned the planting of landmines in rural areas, the execution of enemy agents, torture and mistreatment of ANC members in its exile camps and for killing political opponents.
It said the party must accept responsibility for the activities of ANC Women's League president Winnie Madikizela Mandela, Nelson Mandela's former wife, and her Mandela United Football Club, accused of killings, torture and kidnappings.
The commission also said the PAC was guilty of the deaths of civilians in its strategy in 1993 to drive white farmers off their land so it could be reclaimed by blacks.
Justice Minister Dullah Omar, meeting journalists in Pretoria, would not comment on the news reports about condemnation of the ANC.
"I do expect various responses (to the report).
I do not expect everyone to agree.
It will lead to healthy debate," he said.
He said that if the commissioners recommends prosecutions against anyone for abuses, it will be up to the national director of prosecutions to decide whether to proceed.
The director is appointed by the government.
The commission's work is designed "to help us establish the rule of law in South Africa, and to establish the principle of accountability," Omar said.
The ANC already has prepared the ground for a negative finding, saying weeks ago that the commission had warned that harsh judgments were in the offing.
The ANC was nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with commissioners earlier this month.
The panel refused, to avoid appearing biased.
On Monday, it rejected "with contempt" suggestions ANC officials themselves had leaked the findings.
Constand Viljoen, leader of the tiny right wing Freedom Front, said the ANC had done so to give the commission credibility by making it more even handed.
Publicly, the party has long defended its actions as those committed during a "just war."
F.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid era president, meanwhile, planned to ask a court to prevent the Truth Commission report from implicating him in covering up state sponsored terror.
"Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court," Omar said, but added he would "regret" any court ordered delay.
TRIPOLI, Libya Outwardly at least, nearly everything on display in Libya these days seems calculated to project defiance.
Posters plastered on downtown streets mock six years of U.N. sanctions, hailing as heroes African leaders who have flown to Libya in violation of an international ban on air travel here.
The new backdrop for state television broadcasts is now a map of Africa, not the Arab world, a slap at Arab neighbors accused of being too timid to join Libya's quest to get the sanctions lifted.
A sign affixed to the seaside Grand Hotel captures the spirit exactly, if ungrammatically.
"Hand's Off Libya!" it declares.
And yet behind this stubborn facade there are indications that the Libyan leader, Col Moammar Gadhafi, might at last be close to accepting a compromise that could bring an end to his country's isolation, imposed for its failure to hand over two suspects wanted in the bombing of Pam Am flight 103 over the tiny Scottish village of Lockerbie in 1988, in which 270 were killed.
Although he has sent mixed signals about it, Gadhafi may be carefully weighing a deal, proposed in August by the United States and Britain, that would require Libya to surrender the two suspects for a trial in the Netherlands.
Libya has agreed to the offer in principle, after many years of refusing to hand the suspects over for trial in Britain or the United States.
But it is insisting on certain guarantees, including a promise that the suspects would serve their sentences in the Netherlands or Libya if convicted.
Still, Tripoli based diplomats say they believe that Gadhafi is sincere in wanting to go forward with the arrangement, in part because many ordinary Libyans have begun to get fed up with the U.N. penalties.
"I'm quite sure that the Libyans want to solve the problem," a Western ambassador here said.
"Perhaps at the beginning the embargo didn't make things too hard for the regime.
But over time, I think, it's becoming harder and harder."
The U.N. sanctions ban only international flights to and from Libya and the sale of arms and certain other restricted goods.
Other trade, including oil, moves freely between Libya and other countries by road and sea.
If Libya does not agree to the U.S. British proposal, the Security Council has warned that it will consider tightening sanctions further, with measures that could include a ban on Libya's sales of oil.
But because backing even for the current measures is clearly withering not only in Africa but in other countries around the world, it is far from clear that the Security Council could make good on that threat.
That raises the possibility that even with discomfort at home, Gadhafi may ultimately conclude that his best option is to wait the crisis out.
For now, though, one clear indication that Libya is acting in earnest, diplomats say, is the government's dismissal in September of a lawyer, Ibrahim Legwell, who for seven years headed the suspects' defense team.
Legwell had criticized the U.S. British proposal as inadequate, and in an interview in his offices here, he said that the fact that he had been replaced reflected a desire for greater flexibility.
"It seems that the government doesn't like somebody who says no," he said.
A new team of lawyers, headed by Kamel al Makhour, traveled to New York in October to discuss with U.N. legal officials the arrangements for a possible trial.
And in their first televised appearance in four years, the two Libyans accused of carrying out the bombing told the London based Arabic language satellite channel MBC in October that they were ready to stand trial if their safety was guaranteed.
In an interview published on Oct 18 in the Sunday Times of London, Gadhafi was quoted as saying that he wanted to see an end to confrontation with the West over the Lockerbie case.
"Our people want peace," he said.
"They want to be friends."
In another interview, broadcast on Oct 22 on the BBC, the Libyan leader Gadhafi distanced himself from whoever may have carried out the 1988 bombing, saying that the bombers may have been taking "their own revenge" against the United States for its 1986 air and missile raid on Libya.
At issue is the fate of the two suspects, Abdel Basset Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, who the United States and Britain have said were Libyan intelligence agents.
The two were indicted in 1991 after an investigation concluded that they had carried out the bombing by planting an explosive in a suitcase.
Their former lawyer, Legwell, said that the two men had spent the last six years "not in custody exactly" but without passports and suspended albeit with pay from their jobs with Libyan Arab Airways.
After Libya refused to extradite the two, Britain and the United States successfully pushed for the U.N. sanctions, which were imposed in 1992 and include a ban on arms sales and all international flights.
But those measures have failed to persuade Gadhafi to hand over the suspects and, in the meantime, international support for the sanctions has withered in some quarters.
Gadhafi himself has violated the flight ban on several occasions, but the United Nations has responded with little more than a scolding.
And in the last two months, several African leaders including the heads of state of Niger, Chad, Mali, the Central African Republic, Eritrea, Gambia and Uganda have defiantly traveled to Libya by plane, acts that were officially condoned by the Organization of African Unity.
The 22 member Arab League has been less daring, trying to serve as an intermediary in discussions with Britain and the United States, but choosing at a meeting last month not to flout the sanctions.
It was that decision that infuriated Gadhafi, who during his 29 years in power has always been an ardent proponent of Arab unity.
Within a matter of days, the Libyan leader pronounced that "the Arab world is finished," the map of the Arab world was removed from state television, and the government announced that it had eliminated its Ministry of Arab Unity.
This week it even advised the Arab League that it had decided to downgrade its "permanent" status at the organization to that of a "resident delegation."
In interviews here, Arab and Western diplomats acknowledged that such pique underscored an unpredictability that made it impossible to know whether Gadhafi would ultimately accept the U.S. British plan.
But they said they believed that Gadhafi had been genuinely surprised by the offer, extended on Aug 24.
Although the plan is essentially the same one Gadhafi himself long proposed, the Libyan leader initially dismissed it as one bound to be ridden with tricks.
It calls for the two suspects to be tried in the Netherlands by Scottish judges under Scottish law and promises that the U.N. sanctions will be lifted as soon as the suspects are surrendered.
The United States has described the offer as non negotiable.
But the Libyan leader has raised many questions, including how the appeals would be handled, where the suspects would be imprisoned if convicted, and how their rights would be protected.
Diplomats say they believe that Gadhafi is plainly concerned that the two men will be used by prosecutors to make a case against Libya itself, which some in the West believe had a hand in the bombing.
Still, they say, any Libyan reluctance to accept the deal is almost certainly counterbalanced by worries that a refusal might well prompt the United Nations to make good on a threat to tighten the sanctions, which Libyans see as less and less tolerable.
One Libyan government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, conceded in an interview that if Libyans were asked their frank opinion, the vast majority would say that the suspects should be surrendered to bring an end to sanctions.
While the sanctions do not bar Libya from selling oil, which provides 95 percent of its export earnings, they have made life uncomfortable.
Sales of arms and certain other goods, including airplane parts, are prohibited, and domestic air service within Libya with a territory larger than Alaska has ground nearly to a halt.
And since international air travel is also banned, Libyans who want to travel abroad must begin their journey either by ferry, on an overloaded vessel that makes an overnight crossing from Tripoli to the Mediterranean island of Malta, or with an arduous overland journey across the border into Egypt or Tunisia.
Secretary General Kofi Annan said Wednesday that he may travel to Libya next week in hopes of closing a deal to try two Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.
Annan is heading to North Africa beginning Thursday to resume a visit cut short to deal with the Iraq crisis.
A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's legal counsel to discuss a U.S. British proposal to try the suspects in the Netherlands, according to Scottish law and using Scottish judges.
Because of some positive developments over the past few weeks, "there is now a good chance that the suspects might finally be brought" to trial, a U.N. source said on condition of anonymity.
There is "a sense of optimism," he said.
Libya had accepted the proposal in theory, but had objected to its call for the suspects to be jailed in a Scottish prison if found guilty.
The Tripoli government has insisted that the suspects serve any prison time in Libya or the Netherlands.
It wasn't immediately known if Libyan officials had indicated some flexibility on that point, which diplomats have said was Libya's major concern.
Annan said he had hoped that there would be some breakthruogh by the end of November.
"If that doesn't happen, I will be in the region next week and the question has been raised if it would be helpful for me to go there and bring the issue finally to closure," he said.
"I haven't made up my mind yet, but it has not been excluded," he said.
Two Libyans, Abdel Basset Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, are accused of planting the suitcase bomb that ripped apart the New York bound Pan Am jet on Dec 21, 1988, killing 270 people in the air and on the ground at Lockerbie.
For 10 years, the United States and Britain had demanded the two be tried in the United States or Britain, but agreed in August to a trial in the Netherlands in hopes of finally bringing the issue to a close.
The Security Council endorsed the plan and agreed to suspend sanctions once the two men are turned over.
Council members also agreed to consider additional sanctions if Libya didn't produce the suspects.
Libya has denied U.S. British allegations that it is delaying the hand over of two men wanted for the blowing up of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
The Foreign Ministry said Libya "does not accept the claim that it is procrastinating to gain time as the other sides claim," the official Libyan news agency said Wednesday in a report received in Cairo.
Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of Sate Madeline Albright and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook accused Libya of delaying the case and warned it would face stiffer U.N. sanctions if it did not hand over for trial two Libyans wanted for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which killed 270 people in 1988.
In July, the U.N. Security Council backed a U.S. British plan for the two suspects to stand trial in the Netherlands.
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who had long called for a trial in a neutral country, accepted the proposal in principle, but called for further negotiations and later insisted that, if convicted, the suspects serve their sentences in a Libyan jail.
The plan calls for sentences to be served in a British prison.
The Libyan foreign ministry said it was astonished by the "harmony" between the British and U.S. statements which "confirms Libya's warning that the British American initiative is nothing more than a trick."
Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 to force it to hand over the defendants.
The sanctions include a ban on air links with Libya, an arms embargo and a partial ban on the sale of oil equipment.
The statement said Libya had sent a legal team to the United Nations to discuss the guarantees for the suspects in the event of a trial in the Netherlands.
It was still waiting for answers from the parties concerned.
The U.N. secretariat has called for a meeting between all parties on Nov 9, the statement added.
SABRATHA, Libya Among majestic Roman ruins set against an azure sea, Sebastian Cuisenier walked alone, a rare visitor to a site that almost anywhere else in the world would be thronged with tourists.
"I've always liked pariah countries," Cuisenier, 27, a Frenchman from Marseilles, said when asked why he had included Libya to a two month journey through the region.
"And I have a certain sympathy for people who are battling against imperialism."
As unlikely as it may sound, at least for now, the Libyan authorities are trying hard to persuade more people like Cuisenier to take the same step.
It was not until three years ago that Libya even established a Ministry of Tourism.
Under U.N. sanctions, which prohibit international flights, the only way to reach the country is to travel overland or by ferry.
Since 1995, Libyan officials say they have counted 88000 visitors, about one third as many as arrive in neighboring Egypt in an average month, and Western diplomats say they suspect that even this number may be inflated.
But Libya, which earns 96 percent of its income from oil, has nevertheless now pronounced tourism to be "the industry of the 21st century."
And if real and psychological barriers could be removed, one diplomat said, "the potential is absolutely stunning."
Scattered along Libya's 1100 mile Mediterranean coast are Greek, Phoenician and Roman ruins that together comprise one of the region's richest archaeological treasures.
Sabratha, 45 minutes west of Tripoli, the capital, was first inhabited by the Phoenicians in the sixth century B.C. and also boasts a Roman theater restored in the 1920s by Italian experts.
The largest collection of ruins, at Leptis Magna, 90 minutes to Tripoli's east, are the remains of what was once a city of 100000 people, and are listed by the United Nations as a World Heritage Site.
The beaches are described by foreign residents as the cleanest in the Mediterranean.
The vast desert includes another World Heritage Site, the oasis of Ghadames, a trading post 400 miles south of Tripoli that was first inhabited more than 4000 years ago by the ancient ancestors of today's Tuareg population.
In Wadi Mathendush, in the Akarkous Mountains, rock drawings can be found that date from neolithic times.
Slowly, government officials say, they are making progress in luring visitors to such sites.
A crowd that gathered recently for a cultural festival in Ghadames included the designer Pierre Cardin.
Most tourists are retired, and many are Italians, curious about a land that Italy colonized from 1911 to 1943, and willing to endure the five hour trip to Tripoli from Djerba, Tunisia, the nearest international airport.
Tour buses and visitors with cameras dangling from their necks are no longer a strange site on Tripoli's streets, although both are still scarce enough to satisfy those who have lost their appetite for crowds.
"It is almost empty, and I like quiet empty places," said Francois Lemaire, 63, of Vendome, France.
"What I like most is that I know there are very few tourists here, so it means I can have some peace."
Mohammed Gattus, Libya's undersecretary of tourism, said that a recent two day conference held in Tripoli was intended to help train local tour operators in order to put the industry "on a sound foundation."
But as Cuisenier and others wryly pointed out, the obstacles to travel within Libya particularly by independent visitors remain considerable.
The official exchange rate is wildly inflated, and the government has not yet settled on a plan to establish a more realistic rate for tourists.
Distances are enormous, and most must be traveled by car.
One effect of the U.N. sanctions, imposed since 1992 because of Libya's refusal to surrender suspects accused in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner, has been to ground most of the country's domestic air fleet.
At the same time, the fact that tourism as a phenomenon has been relatively recent, and that the ideology propounded by Col Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, declares their country is a "state of the masses," has created what Cuisenier described as "not exactly a service oriented economy."
Still, Libyan officials say they are confident that when and if the U.N. sanctions are lifted, tourism may indeed become big business.
And ordinary Libyans say they are resentful that animosity from the West, and particularly from the United States, has served to overshadow what they regard as rich attractions.
"My message is simple: we cannot ignore America," Salah el Fathali, the executive director of the National Cancer Institute, said during a chance encounter as he guided two visiting French doctors around the Sabratha site.
"But at the same time, you cannot ignore us."
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe arrived Monday in Egypt after meeting with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
It was not clear if his plane flew directly from Libya in violation of a U.N. air embargo on the North African state.
African countries voted in June to ignore the U.N. flight ban that was imposed in 1992 to try and force Libya to hand over for trial two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
The blast killed 270 people.
Mugabe arrived in Libya Saturday, apparently by plane in violation of the air embargo.
Several African leaders, including the heads of the Congo, Chad and Sudan, have ignored the sanctions since the vote.
Louis Farrakhan, the leader of a U.S. Muslim group, met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday and congratulated him on his recovery from a hip injury, state run Libyan radio reported.
Improved health will enable Gadhafi to "carry on his leading role in the service of Islamic causes in the world," Farrakhan was quoted as saying by the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. Later, state run television showed Gadhafi dressed in a brown robe and holding a cane meeting Farrakhan at his ceremonial tent in the Libyan capital, Tripoli.
The broadcast was monitored in Cairo.
Gadhafi underwent surgery last July after injuring his hip, reportedly while exercising.
The visit was Farrakhan's fifth to Libya in the past three years.
The leader of the U.S. based Nation of Islam most recently visited in December 1997.
It was not immediately clear how Farrakhan arrived in Libya or how long he would stay.
Most visitors arrive by ferry from Malta or travel overland from Egypt or Tunisia, U.N. sanctions imposed in 1992 ban air travel to and from the country.
Farrakhan repeatedly has urged an end to the sanctions, which were imposed to try to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
Citing the sanctions and U.S. regulations, the Treasury Department prohibited Farrakhan from accepting a dlrs 250000 prize he was awarded by Gadhafi in September 1996 for human rights work.
The Treasury also barred his group from accepting Gadhafi's offer of a dlrs 1 billion gift for Nation of Islam activities.
Newspapers reported Wednesday that three top Libyan officials have been tried and jailed in the Lockerbie case, but Libyan dissidents said the reports appeared to be a political ploy by Libya's leader, Col Moammar Gadhafi.
An Egyptian source, who like the Libyans spoke on condition of anonymity, said he heard nothing about any such trials during meetings with leading officials on a just ended trip to the Libyan capital Tripoli.
The reported jailing of the three officials comes as Gadhafi is under pressure to accept a plan to turn over for trial two other Libyans wanted for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that led to 270 deaths.
Two London newspapers, The Guardian and the leading Arabic daily Al Hayat, reported Wednesday that three top intelligence chiefs at the time of the airliner bombing had been convicted and imprisoned in Libya.
The Guardian said Abdullah al Senussi, Musa Koussa and Mohammed al Misrati were sentenced to between five and seven years in prison earlier this month.
Quoting "well placed sources," the Guardian said the charge filed against the three was "dereliction of duty" but gave no further details.
Al Hayat's report said it had questioned Libyan Justice Minister Mohamed Belgasim al Zuwiy about the purported trials, but he had replied only "trials are going on all the time."
Both the Guardian and Al Hayat suggested that the jailing of the three was aimed at blocking their testimony at a trial of the two Libyan suspects which, under a plan approved by the U.N. Security Council, would be heard by Scottish judges in the Netherlands.
After refusing for years to turn over the two men for trial in the United States or Britain, Libya recently accepted in principle the proposed trial in The Hague, Netherlands, but has delayed in actually turning over the two suspects.
The two suspects accused by the United States and Britain, Abdel Basset Ali al Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, were allegedly Libyan intelligence agents.
The Libyan dissidents said the jailings were probably a total invention leaked by Gadhafi's government.
One dissident said the three men had been close associates of Gadhafi for decades and were "too valuable for Gadhafi to dispose of them."
Al Senousi was head of the Libyan intelligence service and Koussa was in charge of its foreign operations during the 1988 bombing.
The third man, al Misrati, was a senior official in the Revolutionary Committees, Gadhafi's ruling party.
The dissidents said Gadhafi's long resistance to turning over the two suspects stemmed from fear that their testimony would directly implicate his government in the bombing.
Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 to force it to hand over the two defendants in the Lockerbie case.
The sanctions include a ban on air links with Libya, an arms embargo and a partial ban on the sale of oil equipment.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe arrived in Egypt Monday after meeting with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
It was not clear if his plane flew directly from Libya in violation of a U.N. air embargo on the North African state.
African countries voted in June to ignore the U.N. flight ban which was imposed in 1992 to try and force Libya to hand over for trial two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
The blast killed 270 people.
Mugabe arrived in Libya Saturday, apparently by plane in violation of the air embargo.
Several African leaders, including the heads of the Congo, Chad and Sudan, have ignored the sanctions since the vote.
Secretary General Kofi Annan said Wednesday that he is considering a trip to Libya next week that could close a deal to try Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.
Annan is heading to North Africa beginning Thursday to resume a visit cut short to deal with the Iraq crisis.
A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's legal counsel to discuss a U.S. British proposal to try the suspects in the Netherlands, according to Scottish law and using Scottish judges.
Because of some positive developments in recent weeks, "there is now a good chance that the suspects might finally be brought" to trial, a U.N. source said on condition of anonymity.
There is "a sense of optimism," he said.
Libya had accepted the proposal in theory, but objected to its call for the suspects to be jailed in a Scottish prison if found guilty.
The Tripoli government has insisted the suspects serve any prison time in Libya or the Netherlands.
It wasn't immediately known if Libyan officials had indicated some flexibility on that point, which diplomats have said was Libya's major concern.
Annan said he had hoped that there would be some breakthruogh by the end of November.
"If that doesn't happen, I will be in the region next week and the question has been raised if it would be helpful for me to go there and bring the issue finally to closure," he said.
"I haven't made up my mind yet, but it has not been excluded," he said.
Two Libyans, Abdel Basset Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, are accused of planting the suitcase bomb that ripped apart the New York bound Pan Am jet on Dec 21, 1988, killing 270 people in the air and on the ground at Lockerbie.
For 10 years, the United States and Britain had demanded the two be tried in the United States or Britain, but agreed in August to a trial in the Netherlands in hopes of finally bringing the issue to a close.
The Security Council endorsed the plan and agreed to suspend sanctions once the two men are turned over.
Council members also agreed to consider additional sanctions if Libya didn't produce the suspects.
The sanctions, which include an air embargo, were imposed to force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to turn the men over.
Annan said his discussions on the proposal had been "very constructive."
The U.N. source said Annan wouldn't travel to Libya unless he had a sense that he could achieve a breakthrough.
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said the suspects in the Lockerbie bombing are "very happy" to be tried in the Netherlands, and he hoped the trial would lead to a better relationship with the United States.
"We can solve this problem very easily," he told the British Broadcasting Corp. in an interview released Tuesday.
"Then the families of the victims will be satisfied and get rid of this anxious problem."
"When peace comes between the two countries, they will shake hands and there will be peace.
After that such acts will automatically come to an end," Gadhafi said.
The United States and Britain have accused Libyans Abdel Basset Ali al Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah of blowing up a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people.
Both men were indicted in 1991, and the United Nations imposed sanctions in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to hand them over.
He argued that the two would not be guaranteed a fair trial in either Britain or the United States.
But after nearly a decade of deadlock, the U.N. Security Council approved a U.S. British plan in August for a trial of the two Libyans in the Netherlands overseen by Scottish judges following Scottish law.
Libya has accepted the idea in principle, but Gadhafi has demanded negotiations to ensure the safety of the suspects.
He also wants the men, if convicted, to serve their sentences in Libya or the Netherlands.
Britain and the United States have refused to negotiate.
Gadhafi did not discuss that obstacle in the BBC interview.
But he did seek to distance himself from the two men, who the United States and Britain say are Libyan agents.
"They may be guilty or not guilty," Gadhafi told the BBC.
"That is the job of the court to decide.
If they are guilty, it is because there is revenge between individual Libyans and America.
Perhaps these Libyans took their own revenge against America."
Gadhafi also claimed to have evidence backing up allegations by a former British spy that Britain plotted to kill the Libyan leader.
The British government has denied using its foreign intelligence service in any part of an assassination attempt, but Gadhafi told the BBC, "Yes, yes, it happened."
"Britain was behind this campaign of assassination.
There is evidence and when the time comes we will bring this evidence forward," he said.
Last month, an Arab television company broadcast a video of what it said was a 1996 assassination attempt against Gadhafi by British intelligence agents.
The footage showed an object flying through the crowd at a rally and landing at Gadhafi's feet.
Gadhafi and his bodyguards looked down at the object, and moved calmly away.
In some of the images, the object appeared to be a superimposed grenade.
David Shayler, the renegade spy who made the claim about the assassination attempt, is currently being held in prison in Paris.
He is due in court Wednesday for an extradition hearing.
If returned to Britain, Shayler faces the prospect of being charged under the Official Secrets Act because of his revelations about the intelligence agency.
The United States and other economic powers moved ahead Saturday toward an overhaul of the world's financial system to prevent widening market turmoil from pushing more countries into recession.
U.S. President Bill Clinton telephoned British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French President Jacques Chirac to lobby personally for a set of proposals he put forward Friday.
Central to the U.S. idea is to use the International Monetary Fund to provide more money, faster, to countries threatened with a flight of panicked investors.
Blair and Chirac said they liked the U.S. approach, and other countries as well have had favorable reactions in discussions with administration economic officials, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who helped develop the proposals, sought the endorsements of finance ministers and central bank presidents from the world's seven richest countries.
After hearing Rubin explain the suggestion that new IMF credit lines be established for countries threatened with investor flight, Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters: "He asked me to support it, and I said I would."
The Group of Seven meeting, at historic Blair House across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House was expected to be pivotal in trying to develop strategies to halt a 15 month economic crisis, as are sessions beginning Sunday of the 182 nation IMF and World Bank.
The World Bank generally loans money for development projects in poor countries, and the IMF oversees rescue efforts for countries experiencing financial difficulties.
A collapse of currencies and stock markets triggered by a flight of foreign investment money has pushed several Asian nations into steep recession, leveled the Russian economy and is now threatening to strike Brazil and other nations in Latin America.
While other countries had their own ideas about how to address the current market turmoil, Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin said he believes the crisis' urgency is molding "a growing consensus about what needs to be done."
Britain's top finance official, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, also sounded a note of urgency and suggested that the Bank of England might act as early as next week to cut interest rates.
That would follow the lead of the Federal Reserve, which cut a key U.S. rate by a quarter point last Tuesday to help ward off recession in the United States.
"As we meet here in Washington, we are conscious that more than a quarter of the world is in recession, that the second largest economy in the world, Japan, is in recession and that the social casualties of the Asian crisis are rising in numbers," Brown said.
He told reporters "strong, decisive and united leadership" is needed to turn talk into action.
Finance ministers from 24 developing countries appealed for lower interest rates from major industrial nations as a way to take pressure off their foreign debt burdens and "help restore confidence in international finance markets."
Still, it was far from certain that all differences will be resolved in coming days.
U.S. officials already have rejected a French proposal to turn the IMF's interim committee into a more permanent crisis coordination body.
"My guess is we won't find a silver bullet, but we will come out with a process," World Bank President James Wolfensohn said.
The U.S. proposal does prescribe new money for the IMF but would require Congress to approve the administration's request of dlrs 18 billion to replenish IMF resources depleted by the need to assemble more than dlrs 100 billion in bailouts for Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and Russia.
That approval is in doubt given significant Republican opposition in the House.
GOP Leader Dick Armey, R Texas, said Clinton's call for quicker release of IMF money is precisely the wrong approach for an agency that has failed so far to halt the crisis from widening.
Other aspects of change being considered are to increase banking supervision in poor countries and provide more loans to help stricken corporations in crisis countries get back on their feet.
The United States also was pushing to get the IMF and other donors behind a rescue for Brazil of perhaps dlrs 30 billion, which could be announced soon after Sunday's presidential elections there.
Rubin and Greenspan pressed the case for Japan to act more forcefully in Saturday's discussions with Miyazawa.
U.S. officials have said troubled Asian countries cannot hope to resume growth unless Japan cleans up its banking troubles and emerges from its own recession.
In a Treasury statement, Rubin welcomed Japan's offer of dlrs 30 billion in new loans to support other Asian nations and said Miyazawa "explained his government's intention to take all possible steps to promote financial stability."
The New York Times said in editorial for Wednesday, Oct 7: Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has little time to savor his apparent first round re election victory Sunday.
He must take rapid and unpopular steps to save the economy.
Brazilians voted for Cardoso because they trusted his economic management more than that of his main rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
da Silva, who leads the Workers Party, campaigned for a more closed economy.
His prescriptions struck many Brazilians as well meaning but unrealistic.
But Cardoso avoided a runoff by the smallest of margins, and his allies failed to win in many important states.
The new Congress, which will take office in February, is likely to be less cooperative than the current one.
Brazil has made great economic strides under policies initiated by Cardoso, first as finance minister and then as president.
Inflation, a perennial problem, has fallen from 3000 percent a year to around zero.
As the economy has grown, many Brazilians have prospered.
Much of that success came from a policy of tying the Brazilian currency, the real, to the dollar, and allowing it to fall about 7 percent a year.
Unfortunately, it appears that the depreciation rate was not enough to keep up with economic realities.
Brazil has been running a large trade deficit as well as a big budget deficit.
Now, with markets fearful, its debts have become crucial.
More than $300 million a day is draining out of the country despite interest rates of 40 percent, which have stopped economic growth.
Cardoso and the Congress must take fiscal discipline seriously.
In May the Congress rejected his social security and civil service reforms.
Then he abandoned restraints during his election campaign, and spending soared.
Now Congress must simplify taxes and improve income tax collection rates especially crucial because these taxes will come from the better off in a country with one of the world's most unequal income distributions.
Brazil must also control spending, especially on pensions for the bloated public sector.
Putting Brazil's finances in order will be painful, but not as painful as economic collapse.
The International Monetary Fund should calm investors by coming up with a bailout to stem the hemorrhage of Brazil's reserves.
But it must be contingent on Brazil's own reforms.
It is unlikely, however, that the international community can find enough money to support the overvalued real forever.
The real will probably eventually have to be devalued, but it is understandable that Brazilians, who remember hyperinflation, fear an immediate and perhaps uncontrolled devaluation.
The perception now is that Latin America could go the way of Asia if Brazil sinks, and such perceptions can create their own problems.
There are good reasons for the world to help Brazil, but Brazil must also deal with its own problems.
The chief executive of the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday there should be a slight improvement in global economic fortunes next year spearheaded by Europe and the United States.
Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, predicted world growth of around 2.5 percent in 1999, creeping up from the recently revised down figure for this year of 2 percent.
Camdessus was in the Spanish capital to attend the fourth meeting of the so called Montevideo Circle, an informal gathering of top ranking politicians and officials who annually hold a behind closed door brainstorming session on Latin American issues.
The IMF chief told reporters that Europe and the United States "the two motors of the world economy" were still going strong, despite some slowdown in America and Great Britain.
He said Asia should be able to keep its economic head just above water, avoiding negative growth next year.
Camdessus said the immediate task was to ensure that Latin America weathered the financial storm that began in Thailand 15 months ago before spreading from Asia to precipitate Russia's recent collapse.
"It is a vital obligation to prevent the Latin domino from falling," Camdessus said, praising Spain's recent offer to help fund emergency credits to the region under threat from investor flight.
He said he hoped other European countries with business interests in Latin America such as Italy, France and Germany would follow the Spanish example.
The IMF and the Brazilian government are putting the final touches to an emergency three year package that should be ratified within weeks, Camdessus said.
The package has been estimated to total dlrs 30 billion.
"Brazil will not collapse," he said, adding that Argentina and Chile were among the keenest to see the IMF reach agreement with their giant neighbor.
Less upbeat about Russia, Camdessus said the Fund was still working toward a financing package, but that the government still lacked a program.
This, he said, would take time, and appealed to governments to provide humanitarian aid in the interim.
The IMF has put together bailout packages totaling over $100 billion during what Camdessus called "the most uncertain year ever."
He said the crisis has underlined the need for prevention, and the transformation of the Fund's primary role away from that of "the firefighter who arrives when the fire is already burning."
Greater private sector involvement in the prevention and resolution of future economic crisis would help, Camdessus said.
"Now, the private sector tends to run away and leave the work to the governments," he said.
Camdessus also said he was aware of recent criticism of excessive IMF secrecy, but he said his own efforts to open up the Fund have been blocked by governments demanding discretion.
Camdessus said that those who viewed the crisis as a critique of the Fund's promotion of world economic liberalization were mistaken.
The man who has headed the IMF for 12 years said that it simply demonstrated the need to carry through liberalization programs properly.
WASHINGTON Increasingly angry at what they consider the lenient treatment that Russia received in its $4.5 billion bailout by the International Monetary Fund, Latin American officials and economists warned Monday that the programs being offered to protect their own countries were too paltry.
Guillermo Ortiz, Mexico's central bank governor and former finance minister, said that faced with the mounting financial pressures on Latin America and the rest of the developing world, the $90 billion the United States wants to give the monetary fund in extra lending money would be adequate "if things go well, but not enough for a bad scenario."
By some calculations, he said, the developing world might need $200 billion in new loans by 1999.
Ortiz's warnings came at a seminar here during this year's annual meeting of the World Bank and the IMF.
When Russia defaulted in August on its huge foreign debts and the United States and other major powers allowed it to happen, he said, South America's ability to withstand the global financial crisis was seriously undermined.
"Until then we were doing fine," he said.
"But everything changed after Russia."
What clearly angered Ortiz and other officials at the seminar was the strong political and financial backing that the United States and other major powers gave Russia right up to the moment it defaulted.
"Russia was treated like a member of the Group of Seven," Ortiz said, referring to the world's most powerful nations, at whose behest the monetary fund lent Russia $17 billion.
"It was unthinkable it could fail," he said.
He added that while Mexico could survive "a period of market instability, it must be temporary or the situation will be out of control."
Ortiz said Russia's default made investors around the world wary of all emerging market countries, including those in Latin America.
Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat of Chile said: "It's the packaging effect.
Analysts don't differentiate between regions, countries or sectors anymore."
"Latin America is being buffeted by external shocks this time, it is not the source of the shocks," said E. Gerald Corrigan of Goldman Sachs and a former president of the New York Federal Reserve, alluding to the Mexican peso's collapse in 1995 and the financial turmoil that it provoked.
All ministers and officials speaking at the seminar, entitled "Latin America: a steady ship in troubled waters?" promised that their countries would continue the free market oriented economic reforms they have introduced in recent years, selling off state owned companies and encouraging private business.
But they also insisted that the United States, other important nations and institutions like the World Bank and the IMF must be ready to help.
The Brazilian finance minister, Pedro Malan, who was greeted with cheers when he announced the apparent re election of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, pledged the government to impose painful new austerity measures to reduce the budget deficit.
"We interpret the election as a mandate to do what we said we would do," he added.
He recalled that early in September the finance ministers and central bank governors of nine Latin American countries had met with World Bank and IMF officials in Washington and vowed "to deepen our reform efforts."
In Brazil, consequently, there would be no changes in the government's exchange rate policy and no resort to controls on outflows of money even though the country has seen about $30 billion of its reserves drain away since July.
But he said nothing about the big financial aid package he is rumored to be negotiating with Washington, the World Bank and the IMF and which some officials now say could total as much as $60 billion.
He did evoke the possibility of a serious breakdown in Latin America's largest economy which is bigger than those of South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand combined by saying the world now has "an historic opportunity to show how by acting together we could have a successful experience at crisis prevention."
So far, Latin American economies have weathered the international crisis relatively well.
The IMF currently expects them to grow at a rate of 2.8 percent this year and 2.7 percent next year, down only 0.6 percent and 1.6 percent respectively on what it predicted last May.
But international confidence in the region's currencies is vulnerable to the balance of payments deficits that all major Latin American countries are running.
They currently range from 3.6 percent and 4.4 percent of total output respectively for Brazil and Argentina, to 7 percent in the case of Chile.
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil When Josue da Silva stepped up to the consumer society four years ago, the ground underfoot felt solid and endless.
For the first time in years inflation in Brazil was under control, and he and his wife had steady jobs.
They moved out of a cramped room behind a store into an apartment and signed to buy furniture, appliances, a stereo system and even a car.
But these days the foundation beneath da Silva is about the size of his wife's shoes.
Out of work since June, he relies on the $40 a day that Mrs da Silva earns cleaning houses, and he walks the streets of Sao Paulo desperate for work.
"I assumed commitments that I don't have any way of getting out of," da Silva, a former salesman in a building supply store, said.
"How could I know that in 1998 I'd be stopped dead?
Our lives have turned around more than 800 degrees."
As Brazilians prepare to vote on Sunday, polls predict that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, highly acclaimed for putting inflation under control, will handily win re election.
But behind the voters' preferences is a kaleidoscope of doubts and difficulties that Brazilians face as their economy grinds to a virtual halt, and they prepare for the humiliation of ceding some degree of sovereignty for an expected $30 billion in aid from the International Monetary Fund.
The president's closest rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, 52, a union leader from the leftist Workers' Party, opposes the bailout and says the administration lacks an effective industrial and employment policy.
Polls project that he will take 24 percent of the vote.
While presidents and prime ministers, central bankers and economists debate whether low inflation should be a higher priority than economic growth, Brazilians ask the same question on a deeply personal level.
After years of failed economic projects and hyperinflation of more than 200 percent a month just four years ago, Brazilians see the global future as inevitable, although they are not sure where they will land in this modern borderless world of commerce.
"The middle of a storm is not the time to change the ship's captain," said Emir Sader, a sociology professor at the University of Sao Paulo and at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, explaining the support for Cardoso.
"It doesn't mean the boat is not sinking, though."
Last month Cardoso pledged to push Social Security and tax overhauls through Congress and to thin the Civil Service rolls.
His plans mirror those that he made four years ago, which were partly sacrificed because of his crusade for a constitutional amendment that let him seek re election.
The delay in trimming government spending heightened Brazil's vulnerability to the credit problem that is affecting emerging markets.
The overnight doubling of effective interest rates to more than 40 percent a year last month has stopped the economy in its tracks.
The sudden drain of confidence, vividly illustrated by the steady exit of $30 billion in foreign reserves since Russia's collapse last month, raised doubts about the direction of the economy that Brazilians once thought was doing well.
Nilton Bonder, a rabbi and the writer of "The Kabbalah of Money," said he felt as if Brazil had been seduced by globalization as a first world nation and had lowered trade barriers without any strategy to modernize industry.
As a result, Bonder noted, some companies in once formidable industries like textiles and toys have slowed production and begun importing from China, "doing what's best for the company rather than what's best for Brazil."
He said he could not imagine what Brazil's long term global role would be.
Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also questioned conventional economic wisdom, wondering how setting up a country like Brazil for recession, with a steep increase in interest rates and cutbacks in government services, could be considered correct.
"Structural reform is supposed to help the supply side of the economy, not be a precondition for increasing demand," Krugman wrote recently.
He likened the solutions for saving Japan, South Korea and other economies in crisis to "trying to bail out a sinking ship with teaspoons."
As the election approaches, Brazilians have hunkered down as if for a tidal wave, expecting that the loss of employment, benefits and government services, combined with the industrial slowdown, will hit them all at once after Sunday.
Though nobody has laid out the details of Social Security changes, pensioners like Nilton Tambara, 54, a retired metalworker, fear becoming its targets.
Cardoso had proposed that age rather than the number of years worked should determine eligibility for retirement.
In a famous gaffe this year he used the word "bums" to describe workers who wanted to retire.
Though Cardoso apologized for the remark, workers like Tambara felt under attack.
Tambara said he began working at 11 and paid into the Social Security system for 33 of the 41 years that he had worked before starting to collect his pension.
He said Brazilian men, on average, lived to 65.
Although Brazil is the ninth largest economy in the world, one quarter of the adults live on one minimum salary of $110 a month.
Seven of 10 Brazilians who will vote next week have had less than a primary level education.
The distribution of income, among the most skewed in the world, continues in retirement, when 15 percent of those who collect Social Security receive 50 percent of the benefits.
"Is there any way to stay calm in this country?"
Tambara asked.
"The categories that the government talks about the rich, the middle class and the poor don't exist.
It's just the rich and the miserable."
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil Through the anxious weeks leading up to the national elections here on Sunday, as some $30 billion fled Brazil despite the doubling of domestic interest rates, international financial officials watched for the government to tackle cost cutting reforms as soon as voting ended.
But Monday, as official returns indicated President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was barely squeaking through to re election and governors allied to him were locked in runoffs later this month, the road to reform is looming longer and more complex.
Polling groups and television stations that reported an overwhelming victory for Cardoso came under severe criticism.
Though exit polls reported Cardoso taking some 56 percent of the vote, official tallies Monday afternoon gave him 51 percent, with 56 percent of the votes counted.
His nearest rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, of the leftist Workers Party, took 34 percent, substantially higher than the 24 percent polls predicted he would take.
Cardoso's margin was just 1.2 percent higher than needed to avoid a second round of balloting.
Ciro Gomes, an up and coming former finance minister from the northeastern state of Ceara, took 11 percent, while Eneas Carneiro, a nationalist who called for Brazil to build an atom bomb, gained 2.2 percent of the vote.
Though voting in Brazil is largely obligatory, the share of abstentions and invalid votes reached 30 percent.
Allies of the president did poorly in many of Brazil's most populous and politically influential states, weakening Cardoso's hand going into negotiations for reform.
Though Brazil has not yet submitted a formal request, Brazilian officials have been in Washington negotiating some form of assistance from the International Monetary Fund that will likely total $30 billion or more.
The country's failure to cut spending in two key areas social security and civil service and to simplify and improve tax collection, makes Brazil heavily dependent on foreign capital at a time when investors generally are fleeing emerging markets.
Brazil's budget deficit is exceeding 7 percent of Gross National Product, and its current account deficit, which includes its balance of trade as well as debt service and other payments, constitutes more than 4 percent of GNP. Government cutbacks of $5 billion, and the doubling of interbank loan rates to almost 50 percent, have slowed but not stopped the flight of capital.
As of 6 p.m. Monday, some $300 million had left foreign reserve coffers, and the Sao Paulo stock market was down 4.47 percent.
Investors appear to be watching for lasting reforms from the government and for signs that wealthy nations will back Brazil.
But the political arena remained strangely silent Monday, almost suspended.
By Monday afternoon, Cardoso still had not claimed victory, and da Silva had not conceded defeat.
Sergio Amaral, the president's spokesman, said Cardoso would wait until official results were completely tallied before speaking.
Newspapers in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo headlined exit polls showing the president doing vastly better than official tallies bore out, and in state races, polling institutes by and large underplayed the strength of leftist candidates, bringing them under sharp attack.
"The nation has watched the most shameful political and electoral manipulation heard of in recent history," said a statement from the coalition of parties that da Silva represented.
It accused the polling institutes, media, and electoral officials of conspiring "to influence public opinion and alter the electoral will."
Mauro Francisco Paulino, director of opinion polls for Datafolha, one of the main polling services, denied any intentional manipulation of the results.
He predicted the final results would support the exit polls.
While it is illegal to announce exit poll results while voting is still going on, it is "traditional" in Brazil, he said.
Brazil's Congress, out campaigning for gubernatorial candidates, will likely not convene to consider reforms before the end of the month, however dire the international situation.
Cardoso appears to be planning for a low profile in the coming weeks, with a brief vacation and a trip to Portugal coming up.
He is not expected to openly campaign for any candidates.
Maria Dalvo Kinzo, a political scientist at the University of Sao Paulo, said the only factor that might make pushing reforms easier for the president this time is the urgency of the crisis.
"There's a consciousness that the crisis is very serious," Ms Kinzo said.
But she warned that with the strong showings of leftist candidates in important state races, and with half the deputies newcomers to Congress, the president's governing coalition was appearing more fragmented.
"Now, he's going to have to really patch together support," she said.
Jose Augusto Guilhermo de Albuquerque, coordinator of the research center on international relations at the University of Sao Paulo, agreed.
"His coalition will be larger and less ideologically committed than the current one," Albuquerque said.
Party discipline, customarily half hearted, will be even weaker in the new panorama, he added.
WASHINGTON As financial leaders from the world's major economies, as well as from many of the most shell shocked, gathered Saturday for talks, the Clinton administration faced unusual challenges from Europe, Japan and emerging market nations, which are all arriving with different and even contradictory strategies for stabilizing the global economy.
The clash of approaches, which began to play out as Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin sat down Saturday morning with Japan's finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, reflects both the extraordinary tension and the behind the scenes power struggles under way as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank open their annual meeting here.
After months of market plunges, currency devaluations, bank failures and bankruptcies around the globe, governments are searching desperately for some kind of coordinated approach that can halt some of the most virulent economic turmoil in half a century.
But it will not be easy, officials concede.
As the meetings opened, Miyazawa announced a $30 billion Japanese program to aid stricken countries throughout Asia.
The program includes government loans, the purchase of bonds issued by Asian nations and guarantees that private bank loans will be repaid.
While Southeast Asian countries immediately hailed the move, the Clinton administration's response was lukewarm.
Rubin had said on Friday, even before the announcement, that Japan's action was "constructive," but that getting its own banks in order and its huge economy restarted was "by vast multiples more important."
Miyazawa, a former prime minister who has 40 years of experience dealing with the United States, shot back Saturday that President Clinton's proposals for new strategies on how the IMF could choke off crises before they start "would not be very convincing unless the United States' commitments to the IMF are lived up to."
He was referring to Congress' refusal so far to approve $18 billion in new money for the fund, an issue that Senate and House conferees will be debating as the meetings go on here this week.
President Clinton will take the unusual step of participating directly on Monday in a critical meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from 22 nations.
And on Tuesday he will speak to the entire IMF, which represents 182 nations, in his second major speech on the world economy in three weeks.
Clinton set the urgent tone of the meetings on Friday, when he declared that the world was on a "financial precipice."
But Clinton, who last spring was resisting advice that he become far more publicly involved in managing the world's financial chaos, insisted that it was not too late to act. "We don't have to have a worldwide recession if those of us that enjoy growth will take the initiative and move now," he said at the White House.
A dramatic initiative to stop the financial contagion may come within days as the IMF, the Treasury Department and Brazil's finance minister, Pedro Malan, put the final touches on a package of $30 billion or more to stabilize the Brazilian economy.
Rubin met with Malan at the Treasury late on Friday, and there was considerable speculation that the package could be announced as soon as voting is completed on Sunday in Brazil's presidential election.
The vote is expected to result in the re election of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
Clinton administration officials say they fear that a financial meltdown in Brazil would take the rest of Latin America with it, and bring the crisis to the United States' own borders.
Nonetheless, the cacophony of competing ideas suggests that it will be extraordinarily difficult to get nations facing a varied array of problems deep recession and mass unemployment in Southeast Asia, political paralysis in Russia and Indonesia, huge bank failures in Japan, an incipient currency crisis in Brazil, but continued prosperity in Western Europe and the United States to settle on a common agenda.
The United States, for example, is insisting that there be no backing away from a decade long move toward freer and more open financial markets around the world.
But the Japanese and Southeast Asians are talking about "capital controls" that would reimpose government regulation preventing investors from moving billions in short term investments from one country to another with a few taps on the computer keyboard.
The French, meanwhile, want to increase the power of the committee that oversees the IMF, while Russia is threatening to default on its loans unless it is quickly given billions that the fund suspended when President Boris Yeltsin fired his team of economic reformers and violated the terms of his accord for Western aid.
A senior IMF official said last month that Russia's threats are "a form of blackmail, but the enormous turbulence touched off by the Russian financial debacle in September gives real teeth to Russia's threats.
Clinton and Rubin are hoping to craft their own strategies to calm the financial markets and keep the worst effects of the recession from hitting U.S. shores, where exports and corporate profits are already badly affected.
The most immediate of those strategies would allow the IMF to launch pre emptive strikes to bolster the finances of fundamentally healthy economies where the global economic contagion seems likely to hit next.
Currently the fund intervenes with billions in emergency aid only after disaster strikes and investors are fleeing.
But by that time, the country's currency is already under heavy attack, and putting together a bailout can cost far more and often involves austerity measures from budget cuts to sky high interest rates that lead to soaring unemployment and political backlash.
The administration's proposal will first be debated by the Group of Seven industrial nations and then, if it gathers much support, by a larger meeting of 22 nations, including most of the major emerging markets.
But a senior Japanese official noted Saturday that the president's plan "seems aimed mostly at Latin America" and probably would "not meet a lot of enthusiasm in Europe and Asia."
Meanwhile the Europeans are debating how to respond to calls from Washington for a lowering of interest rates, a step Japan and the United States have already taken though with the most modest of reductions.
Gordon Brown, Britain's finance minister, hinted late in the week before last that London may follow suit.
But Germany, traditionally far more concerned about inflation, has declined to follow suit.
The German government is playing an unusually small role here as its incoming chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, prepares to assemble an economic team.
The Southeast Asian nations which only five years ago were the subject of a much discussed World Bank study called "The East Asian Miracle" arrived here in shock and confusion about what to do next.
The first nation to be hit by trouble, Thailand, is mired in difficulties, but looks good in comparison with most of the region's other nations.
Malaysia is suffering economic turmoil, and Indonesia's economy is plunging so deeply into recession that the IMF is backing away from many of its demands on its government.
"In my country," said one Indonesian during a question and answer period at the opening session of the meetings here, "IMF means I'm Finished."
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil Brazilian voters appeared to re elect President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in the first round of balloting Sunday, thus maintaining the leadership of a country struggling against economic crisis.
In preliminary returns, Cardoso appeared to have defeated Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the three time presidential candidate of the leftist Workers Party, with 56 percent of the vote, a far stronger showing than polls initially predicted.
Cabinet members gathering at the presidential palace in Brasilia Sunday night called the vote a mandate for reform, which the president is under national and international pressure to carry out.
With $30 billion having drained from federal reserves since Russia's economic collapse in late August, and the Sao Paulo stock market down more than 40 percent this year, the Brazilian government has been somewhat paralyzed by the approach of elections.
It has been negotiating a bailout with the International Monetary Fund, but has been unable to show progress on structural reforms that would cut government expenses over the long term.
But the waiting is probably not over yet.
The size of his victory strengthens Cardoso's hand for the politically sensitive social security, civil service and tax overhauls ahead.
But, political analysts said, Congress will probably not convene to consider painful economic reforms before important gubernatorial runoffs on Oct 25.
With policy makers at the meetings of the Group of Seven top industrialized nations and the International Monetary Fund in Washington seeking permanent solutions to ward off the volatility that is threatening Brazil after devastating Asia and Russia, Cardoso is expected to start taking steps to put Brazil's accounts in order.
Antonio Carlos Alkimin, a political science professor at Catholic University and chief of population studies at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, said he did not expect that Cardoso could make progress toward restructuring the government before Oct 25, because these measures would require legislative approval.
"What he can do is take measures on the administrative level to cut costs, or to play with controls on currency," Alkimin said.
But Gregg Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential Securities, said that financial markets were not expecting concrete reforms from Brazil in the next few weeks.
"The next thing everybody's going to be watching is whether there is an IMF and World Bank package to support Brazil and whether the Brazilians are starting to take actions to work on the budget deficit," he said.
"If those two things look like they're moving in the right direction, it will begin to calm financial markets."
Sunday's balloting was somewhat confused, with about half the country voting on small shoebox sized computers that elderly voters had trouble mastering.
Though electioneering was required to end before polls opened, most candidates appeared to ignore the prohibition.
At Rocinha, in Rio de Janeiro, believed to be the largest slum in South America with about 300000 residents, palm sized photos of candidates fluttered like autumn leaves through the air and carpeted the streets.
People waited more than an hour to cast their votes, with many supporting Cardoso for re election.
Luiz Claudio Silveira, a 34 year old horse trainer, said he planned to vote for Cardoso, largely because he ended inflation.
"If you go to the supermarket, you can buy whatever you need now," he said.
"Four years is not enough to change a country as big as ours.
I really believe in him."
Rute Vicente Oliveira, a 48 year old manicurist, also planned to vote for Cardoso.
She said that for most of her life, her family lived in a lean to, too poor to build a proper home.
It was her father's dream, she said, and he died before it was realized.
"Now, the house is almost done, it's almost completely in order," she said.
Gilberto Manuel da Silva, 40, who owns an ice cream parlor, said that he expected the economic adjustments that Cardoso announced would hurt him personally, but he was prepared to sacrifice in order to stabilize Brazil's economy.
"I'm thinking more about the situation of the country," da Silva said.
"With a stable money, our situation will get better."
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil Brazilian voters gave President Fernando Henrique Cardoso a comfortable lead in the first round of balloting Sunday, apparently maintaining the leadership of a country struggling against economic crisis.
With 22 percent of the vote counted, Cardoso appeared to have won 51 percent of the vote, compared with 34 percent for his main rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the three time presidential candidate of the leftist Workers Party.
If he still has a majority when returns are complete, Cardoso will be declared re elected without facing a runoff.
Exit polls indicated that he might win as much as 56 percent.
Cabinet members gathering at the presidential palace in Brasilia Sunday night called the vote a mandate for the economic measures that the president is under national and international pressure to carry out.
With $30 billion having drained from federal reserves since Russia's economic collapse in late August, and with the Sao Paulo stock market down more than 40 percent this year, the Brazilian government has been close to paralyzed by the approach of the election.
It has been negotiating a bailout with the International Monetary Fund but has been unable to show progress on structural changes that would cut government expenses over the long term.
The waiting is probably not over yet, though.
The size of his victory strengthens Cardoso's hand for the politically sensitive social security, civil service and tax overhauls ahead.
But political analysts said Congress would probably not convene to consider the painful economic measures before important gubernatorial runoffs on Oct 25 because the legislators will be busy campaigning for their parties' gubernatorial candidates.
With policy makers at meetings of the Group of Seven industrial nations and the International Monetary Fund in Washington seeking permanent solutions to ward off the volatility that is threatening Brazil after devastating Asia and Russia, Cardoso is under considerable pressure to put Brazil's accounts in order.
But Gregg Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential Securities in New York, said the international financial markets were not necessarily expecting major changes from Brazil in the next few weeks.
"The next thing everybody's going to be watching is whether there is an IMF and World Bank package to support Brazil, and whether the Brazilians are starting to take actions to work on the budget deficit," he said.
"If those two things look like they're moving in the right direction, it will begin to calm financial markets."

Luiz Claudio Silveira, 34, a horse trainer who voted in Rocinha, said he planned to vote for Cardoso, largely because the president had ended inflation.
"If you go to the supermarket, you can buy whatever you need now," Silveira said.
"Four years is not enough to change a country as big as ours.
I really believe in him."
Rute Vicente Oliveira, 48, a manicurist, also planned to vote for Cardoso.
For most of her life, she said, her family lived in a lean to, too poor to build a proper home.
Her father dreamed of giving his family solid, sturdy shelter, Ms Oliveira said, but he died before concrete blocks replaced the family's plywood slats.
"Now the house is almost done," she said.
"It's almost completely in order."
Many voters appeared to be unaware of the fiscal adjustments ahead, though the president announced less than two weeks before the election that government belt tightening measures would be inevitable.
Of the 106 million Brazilians eligible to vote Sunday, nearly 70 percent have less than an elementary school education, and 35 percent are barely literate.
Gilberto Manuel da Silva, 40, who owns an ice cream parlor, said that he expected the economic adjustments to hurt him personally but that he was prepared to sacrifice to stabilize Brazil's economy.
The president said he would cut government costs, crack down on tax evaders and, if necessary, raise taxes to increase revenues.
"I'm thinking more about the situation of the country than of myself," da Silva said.
"With a stable money, our situation will get better."
BRASILIA, Brazil As a three man economic team headed for Washington, and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso flew off to Portugal, Brazilian government officials put the finishing touches Friday on an ambitious package to raise $20 billion in revenues through spending cuts and tax increases next year.
But public announcement of those measures, eagerly awaited by investors and markets throughout Latin America, appear set for delay once again.
Details of Brazil's plans to reduce its high deficits, initially expected to be announced just after Cardoso's Oct 5 re election, and then on Oct 20, now will likely not be disclosed before the second round of gubernatorial elections Oct 25, legislators said.
Since the economic collapse of Russia in August, investors and economists have sharpened their focus on Brazil.
While President Clinton lobbied Congress for $18 billion to restock the International Monetary Fund this week, with an eye toward assisting Brazil, the team that returned here from the IMF's annual meeting in Washington earlier this month scoured government accounts for politically feasible sources of savings and reform.
Though the country has sped up various receipts the government is getting for privatizing state entities like the phone system to replenish foreign reserves, it is losing more than $400 million a day from central bank coffers.
Foreign reserves, which had stood at $70 billion, are down to $46 billion, with capital flight surpassing $30 billion despite the government's doubling of interest rates to more than 40 percent.
Three senior government officials, Pedro Parente and Amaury Bier of the Finance Ministry and Altamir Lopes of the central bank, are scheduled to meet this weekend with IMF officials in Washington to discuss the government's blueprint for cutbacks and reforms.
Eager to avoid replaying the contentious and unpopular IMF accords of the 1980s, Brazilian officials are trying to disassociate the hardship to come from the IMF.
The steps to cut the budget deficit are being portrayed as measures to rehabilitate the economic systems.
In that way, the administration here hopes to avoid the humiliation of appearing to bend economic policy to IMF orders once again.
The IMF goal corresponds to a 2.5 percent to 3 percent surplus in Brazil's primary budget account, which covers government expenses but excludes interest payments on debt.
"It will be drastic, but we have to deliver that," said Demosthenes Madureiro do Pinho, the director of international relations at the Brazilian central bank.
Higher interest rates on the national debt are bringing the cost of the debt to 3.5 percent of Brazil's economy, Pinho said, adding that spending reforms are key to restoring confidence and, ultimately, lowering interest rates.
In August, before Russia's economic collapse triggered a swift and sizable flight of capital from Brazil, the government had presented a budget for next year with a primary account surplus of 0.92 percent, or $6 billion.
A senior official at the Planning Ministry, Martus Tavares, says there is little room for the federal government to reduce its budget by much more.
So the government will depend on tax increases and savings by states and municipalities to raise the remaining $14 billion.
The federal government will likely create new taxes, increase existing ones and consolidate others to raise more revenues, though economists warn that an expected deepening of the recession in Brazil bodes ill for tax revenues.
Michel Temer, president of the lower house of Parliament, said in an interview here that Congress would begin debate on social security reform Nov 4, and would begin what promises to be a stormy debate on political reform soon after.
The measures being discussed include a 0.1 percent increase on a special government tax on every check written, to 0.3 percent.
Congress passed the tax in 1996 as a one year effort to improve the deteriorating public health system, but the revenue has been used to offset excess spending in other areas.
Last year, the tax brought in $7 billion.
With a 0.1 percent increase, it will likely bring in another $3 billion, and it would be made permanent.
The three year plan of adjustments also relies on states and municipalities to produce about 30 percent of the projected savings through legally mandated spending limits, though states have had a spotty record in controlling outlays.
While Cardoso clearly interpreted his victory this month as a mandate for swift, if painful, reforms, it is by no means clear that state governors are hearing the same message from voters.
In gubernatorial races in key Brazilian states, Brazilians are favoring candidates that are not particularly known for austerity.
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil Rivals of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso won important victories in gubernatorial races Sunday, handing the recently re elected president a complex landscape for pushing through long delayed government and economic reforms.
In Sao Paulo, however, Brazil's most populous and wealthiest state, Mario Covas appeared likely to win re election as governor, defeating former Sao Paulo mayor Paulo Maluf.
Although Maluf's party forms part of the president's governing coalition, Cardoso had endorsed Covas.
Maluf is known as a big spender with presidential ambitions of his own.
His victory could have complicated Cardoso's efforts to control state spending and win congressional approval for reforms.
Despite considerable foreign pressure on Brazil to demonstrate how it will restructure government to reduce deficits, Cardoso has put off publicly announcing his plans, fearing they could damage the chances of his allies in the elections.
The delay costs Brazil heavily, each day, the country loses hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign reserves, and the longer the country maintains interest rates over 40 percent, the deeper its recession and debt.
With Brazil's solvency seen as crucial to maintaining economic stability of Latin America and protecting the United States from recession, the United States and the International Monetary Fund are preparing to chip in toward an aid package of at least $30 billion to shore up Brazil.
Cardoso won re election on the first round of national voting earlier this month, but partial results showed left of center candidates leading in some of the most developed states of Brazil.
Sen Pedro Piva, of the president's Brazilian Social Democracy Party, called Sunday's elections "a warning sign for the government," adding, "I think we're going to have difficulties ahead to approve this package."
The governors are important both because they control a considerable share of the national budget and act as natural leaders of their parties in Congress.
States will be called upon to cut their budgets by as much as 20 to 30 percent, which will mean laying off civil servants.
Current laws allow the states to fire workers if the payroll exceeds 60 percent of the state budget, under a new law the administration is proposing, layoffs would become mandatory once that ceiling was reached.
In Rio de Janeiro, Anthony Garotinho, a former mayor of the city of Campos who belongs to the leftist Democratic Workers Party, was leading over Cesar Maia, a former Rio mayor belonging to a conservative grouping.
In Rio Grande do Sul in the south, Olivio Dutra of the Workers' Party was also leading over the incumbent, Antonio Britto, a Cardoso ally.
In Minas Gerais, former President Itamar Franco was leading by a wide margin over the incumbent Eduardo Azeredo, also of Cardoso's centrist Brazilian Social Democracy Party.
Franco's party belongs to the governing coalition, but Franco has been critical of Cardoso's economic policies and personally stung by the president's re election.
In 1993, during Franco's presidency, he named Cardoso finance minister and launched the economic plan that would make Cardoso a national hero to a people weary of hyperinflation.
But Franco was deeply humiliated at his party's convention earlier this year, when he sought to run for president against Cardoso.
He was not only turned down, but laughed at.
Sunday night, Sen Maguito Vilela, of Franco's Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, said backing for Cardoso's reforms would not be automatic.
The party would not support tax increases, he said, noting that one tax slated for increase, on financial transfers, was initially approved as a temporary measure to finance hospitals, but ended up going to offset the deficit.
"It just burdened people and didn't do anything to improve health care," he said.
Asked on Brazilian television precisely which measures his party would endorse, Vilela said, "If it means more sacrifice for the people," his party "will not support it."
The New York Times said in editorial for Wednesday, Oct 7: Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has little time to savor his apparent first round re election victory Sunday.
He must take rapid and unpopular steps to save the economy.
Brazilians voted for Cardoso because they trusted his economic management more than that of his main rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
da Silva, who leads the Workers Party, campaigned for a more closed economy.
His prescriptions struck many Brazilians as well meaning but unrealistic.
But Cardoso avoided a runoff by the smallest of margins, and his allies failed to win in many important states.
The new Congress, which will take office in February, is likely to be less cooperative than the current one.
Brazil has made great economic strides under policies initiated by Cardoso, first as finance minister and then as president.
Inflation, a perennial problem, has fallen from 3000 percent a year to around zero.
As the economy has grown, many Brazilians have prospered.
Much of that success came from a policy of tying the Brazilian currency, the real, to the dollar, and allowing it to fall about 7 percent a year.
Unfortunately, it appears that the depreciation rate was not enough to keep up with economic realities.
Brazil has been running a large trade deficit as well as a big budget deficit.
Now, with markets fearful, its debts have become crucial.
More than $300 million a day is draining out of the country despite interest rates of 40 percent, which have stopped economic growth.
Cardoso and the Congress must take fiscal discipline seriously.
In May the Congress rejected his social security and civil service reforms.
Then he abandoned restraints during his election campaign, and spending soared.
Now Congress must simplify taxes and improve income tax collection rates especially crucial because these taxes will come from the better off in a country with one of the world's most unequal income distributions.
Brazil must also control spending, especially on pensions for the bloated public sector.
Putting Brazil's finances in order will be painful, but not as painful as economic collapse.
The International Monetary Fund should calm investors by coming up with a bailout to stem the hemorrhage of Brazil's reserves.
But it must be contingent on Brazil's own reforms.
It is unlikely, however, that the international community can find enough money to support the overvalued real forever.
The real will probably eventually have to be devalued, but it is understandable that Brazilians, who remember hyperinflation, fear an immediate and perhaps uncontrolled devaluation.
The perception now is that Latin America could go the way of Asia if Brazil sinks, and such perceptions can create their own problems.
There are good reasons for the world to help Brazil, but Brazil must also deal with its own problems.
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil The Brazilian government, which recently pledged to slash discretionary spending by $7 billion in an urgent attempt to boost its economic credibility, has released new budget figures that show the true reduction will run about half the promised amount.
Total spending would actually increase next year.
The original spending cuts, announced two weeks ago, were part of an anxiously awaited program to raise government revenues next year by $23.5 billion, and represented Brazil's commitment to fiscal house cleaning and to shrinking its dangerously high budget deficit.
The package was crucial for Brazil to qualify for a backup loan from the International Monetary Fund and other sources, including the U.S. government, and to counter a $30 billion hemorrhage from Brazil's foreign reserves, which have fallen to about $42 billion.
The Clinton administration is concerned that a default in Brazil the world's ninth largest economy and home to more than half of South America's 300 million people could trigger repercussions around Latin America, the destination of some 20 percent of U.S. exports.
With the IMF aid package expected to be announced within days, the revised 1999 budget sent to Congress on Monday suggests that Brazil may have overstated the level of actual government savings, and it raised questions about the true size of the government's effort.
Planning Minister Paulo Paiva and Martus Tavares, the government's executive secretary, could not be reached for comment.
David Fleischer, a professor at the Federal University of Brasilia and president of the Brazilian chapter of Transparency International, said the spending cuts were designed to restore confidence abroad with a show of discipline that is partly illusion.
"Maybe about half the savings is real," Fleischer said.
"The other half is pre packed fat.
They stuffed it all in the budget in late August."
The figure of $7 billion in budget cuts is not entirely without foundation.
But it is based on savings from a generous 1999 budget that, from the moment it was released in August, was acknowledged to be unrealistically optimistic.
The budget projected 4 percent economic expansion for 1999, just after Brazil had doubled the ceiling on interest rates to almost 50 percent, to counter a $1 billion a day flight of dollar reserves from the country after the Russian collapse.
Soon after it was released, the government conceded that the economy, instead of growing, would shrink by 1 percent next year, and some independent economists predict a more severe recession, noting that high interest rates are choking off the supply of capital for private industry.
Compared to this year's spending, the government's budget for next year shows some $3.8 billion in actual savings on discretionary expenses, with the budget dropping to $29.8 billion.
The original budget for next year projected $36.4 billion on discretionary expenses, which include a range of programs, including land purchases for agrarian reform and to extend basic sanitation.
But the Brazilian government's overall budget, because of court ordered increases in salaries and benefits, will increase $1.9 billion next year, to $154.2 billion, despite its claims to austerity.
Though some economists, like Paulo Rabello de Castro, of the Rio based Atlantic Institute, say they are confident that Brazil is on the road to righting itself, they appear discouraged by its current response to the crisis.
Even before this week's details appeared, economists criticized the Government for relying heavily on taxes increases and pension dues to raise more than half the promised revenues.
The government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is already fighting skepticism abroad, after he announced another austerity package a year ago, only to drop it as elections neared.
"When you're in a situation like Brazil is in, you usually have to do more than enough to win back confidence," Castro said.
"What came out of 1999 budget was slightly less than enough."
Alexandre Barros, a political scientist and consultant in Brasilia, said he believed the big question surrounding Brazil was not so much the size of the cuts made now, but the government's ability to sustain lean spending practices over time.
"What I want to see is down the road," Barros said.
"What happens after three or six months as the immediate pressures recede, and people say, 'Okay, Mr President, why don't you revoke this or that austerity measure?"
Attention has shifted in Brazil from the president's almost certain re election to gubernatorial runoff elections, on which the success of belt tightening measures deemed necessary to avert an economic meltdown may hinge.
With 69.5 percent of the votes counted Tuesday, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso Cardoso continued to lead with 52.4 percent of the vote.
His closest rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the leftist Workers Party had 32.6 percent, and Ciro Gomes of the Popular Socialist Party had 11 percent.
Nine other candidates shared the rest.
Cardoso must win more than half the vote from Sunday's election to avoid a second round runoff a feat he is expected to easily accomplish.
The same rule applies to the gubernatorial candidates in all 27 states, and at least 14 of them appeared headed to a second round of voting on Oct 25.
"Governors have always exerted enormous influence on their states' congressional bloc," said Luciano Dias a Brasilia based political consultant.
"And the outcome of the runoff elections will definitely determine just how easy, or difficult, it will be for Cardoso to persuade Congress to approve the austerity measures."
He said that if Cardoso opponents win runoff elections in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul, "the going will get tough."
Together, those four states occupy 200 of the 513 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and account for 67.29 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
"If the opposition wins in these states Cardoso will face a formidable wall of resistance against the unpopular measures that are certain to come," Dias said.
"The president will get his measures, but he will have to negotiate, and that means bartering, which could weaken the austerity package."
Brazil, like other emerging markets, is suffering from a loss of investor confidence and a strong outflow of capital.
The country's foreign reserves have fallen below dlrs 50 billion from the dlrs 70 billion posted at the end of July.
To prevent a collapse of the real and stem capital flight, interest rates were hiked to 50 percent a year.
Cardoso has promised to tackle the country's ballooning a budget deficit equal to 7.3 percent of gross domestic product and hinted that taxes would be increased.
Although most observers agree that the faster these measures are defined and introduced, the better, Cardoso is unlikely to impose them until after the second round of voting.
To do so would jeopardize the chances of pro government gubernatorial candidates.
Chip Brown, chief Latin American economist for Salomon Smith Barney in New York, said that little news was expected over the next few weeks on the fiscal package meant to restore confidence among investors.
"I hope the market doesn't expect too much immediately," he said, adding that the best markets can hope for in the short term is broad sketches of a fiscal plan.
Ricardo Ribeiro, a Sao Paulo political consultant, said delaying the measures could make their approval more difficult.
"As the population gets a better notion of the seriousness of the crisis and the severity of the measures that will certainly be adopted, Cardoso's popularity will erode," he said.
"And if his popularity drops, so will his chances to get Congress' approval for these measures."
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil Through the anxious weeks leading up to the national elections here on Sunday, as some $30 billion fled Brazil despite the doubling of domestic interest rates, international financial officials watched for the government to tackle cost cutting reforms as soon as voting ended.
But Monday, as official returns indicated President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was barely squeaking through to re election and governors allied to him were locked in runoffs later this month, the road to reform is looming longer and more complex.
Polling groups and television stations that reported an overwhelming victory for Cardoso came under severe criticism.
Though exit polls reported Cardoso taking some 56 percent of the vote, official tallies Monday afternoon gave him 51 percent, with 56 percent of the votes counted.
His nearest rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, of the leftist Workers Party, took 34 percent, substantially higher than the 24 percent polls predicted he would take.
Cardoso's margin was just 1.2 percent higher than needed to avoid a second round of balloting.
Ciro Gomes, an up and coming former finance minister from the northeastern state of Ceara, took 11 percent, while Eneas Carneiro, a nationalist who called for Brazil to build an atom bomb, gained 2.2 percent of the vote.
Though voting in Brazil is largely obligatory, the share of abstentions and invalid votes reached 30 percent.
Allies of the president did poorly in many of Brazil's most populous and politically influential states, weakening Cardoso's hand going into negotiations for reform.
Though Brazil has not yet submitted a formal request, Brazilian officials have been in Washington negotiating some form of assistance from the International Monetary Fund that will likely total $30 billion or more.
The country's failure to cut spending in two key areas social security and civil service and to simplify and improve tax collection, makes Brazil heavily dependent on foreign capital at a time when investors generally are fleeing emerging markets.
Brazil's budget deficit is exceeding 7 percent of Gross National Product, and its current account deficit, which includes its balance of trade as well as debt service and other payments, constitutes more than 4 percent of GNP. Government cutbacks of $5 billion, and the doubling of interbank loan rates to almost 50 percent, have slowed but not stopped the flight of capital.
As of 6 p.m. Monday, some $300 million had left foreign reserve coffers, and the Sao Paulo stock market was down 4.47 percent.
Investors appear to be watching for lasting reforms from the government and for signs that wealthy nations will back Brazil.
But the political arena remained strangely silent Monday, almost suspended.
By Monday afternoon, Cardoso still had not claimed victory, and da Silva had not conceded defeat.
Sergio Amaral, the president's spokesman, said Cardoso would wait until official results were completely tallied before speaking.
Newspapers in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo headlined exit polls showing the president doing vastly better than official tallies bore out, and in state races, polling institutes by and large underplayed the strength of leftist candidates, bringing them under sharp attack.
"The nation has watched the most shameful political and electoral manipulation heard of in recent history," said a statement from the coalition of parties that da Silva represented.
It accused the polling institutes, media, and electoral officials of conspiring "to influence public opinion and alter the electoral will."
Mauro Francisco Paulino, director of opinion polls for Datafolha, one of the main polling services, denied any intentional manipulation of the results.
He predicted the final results would support the exit polls.
While it is illegal to announce exit poll results while voting is still going on, it is "traditional" in Brazil, he said.
Brazil's Congress, out campaigning for gubernatorial candidates, will likely not convene to consider reforms before the end of the month, however dire the international situation.
Cardoso appears to be planning for a low profile in the coming weeks, with a brief vacation and a trip to Portugal coming up.
He is not expected to openly campaign for any candidates.
Maria Dalvo Kinzo, a political scientist at the University of Sao Paulo, said the only factor that might make pushing reforms easier for the president this time is the urgency of the crisis.
"There's a consciousness that the crisis is very serious," Ms Kinzo said.
But she warned that with the strong showings of leftist candidates in important state races, and with half the deputies newcomers to Congress, the president's governing coalition was appearing more fragmented.
"Now, he's going to have to really patch together support," she said.
Jose Augusto Guilhermo de Albuquerque, coordinator of the research center on international relations at the University of Sao Paulo, agreed.
"His coalition will be larger and less ideologically committed than the current one," Albuquerque said.
Party discipline, customarily half hearted, will be even weaker in the new panorama, he added.
With President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic austerity plan at a critical point for Brazil, voters went to the polls Sunday to elect governors in 12 states and the Federal District of Brasilia.
Voting was calm after polls opened at 8 a.m. (1000 GMT), showing little of the illegal but last minute campaigning that pervaded the first round election on Oct 4.
Even so, army troops were deployed at voting stations in four northern states to ensure peace.
The austerity plan was very much on the minds of the 64 million Brazilians expected to vote.
Paulo Garrini, a business administration student in Sao Paulo, said it was one reason he voted for incumbent Gov. Mario Covas, a Cardoso ally.
"Covas made it clear he will support Cardoso in the austerity measures the country needs, no matter how painful they may be," Garrini said.
But many voters are indifferent, believing that hard times are ahead no matter what their choice at the polls.
Caught up in the financial turmoil that began more than a year ago in Southeast Asia, Brazil believes it needs to slash government spending and raise taxes quickly to shore up its flagging economy and restore investor confidence.
The difficulty, however, of pushing through such unpopular measures at election time became evident when Cardoso repeatedly put off announcing the austerity package.
Such measures were initially expected after first round elections, in which Cardoso was re elected and 14 state governors were chosen.
After the election, Cardoso said the package could be announced by Oct 20.
But with 13 government allied candidates facing tough run offs, he postponed it until after the Oct 25 second round elections.
David Fleischer, a professor of political science at the University of Brasilia said it was a smart move on the president's part.
"Governors have far more power and a direct hold on their states than the president has over the whole country," said Fleischer.
"Their influence and political weight should not be underestimated."
Another reason Cardoso needs allies at the state level is to curb their overspending, which accounts for a big chunk of the government's dlrs 65 billion budget deficit.
Even without announcing harsh budget cutting measures, the situation still looks fairly grim for Cardoso allies in Brazil's four most developed states Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul.
In Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse with more than 34 million inhabitants, Covas came from behind in the polls to pass Paulo Maluf, a populist candidate with a taste for extravagant public works projects.
In Rio de Janeiro, polls put opposition candidate Anthony Garotinho well ahead of Cardoso ally Cesar Maia.
"Whoever wins, it's going to be difficult because it doesn't look like there's going to be much money to spend," said Paulo Benevides, a 22 year old college student.
He said he planned to vote for Maia, Rio's mayor.
Brazilian stocks dropped sharply Monday in the lowest trading volume of the year despite the almost certain re election of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
Brazil's largest stock exchange, Sao Paulo Bovespa, lost 4.5 percent while the smaller Rio de Janeiro stock exchange fell 3.4 percent.
Although Cardoso seems to have clinched a first round win, investors feared that he would put off any announcement of the harsh economic measures deemed necessary until the second round of voting for a number of governors, senators and federal deputies takes place on Oct 25.
"Cardoso has won in the first round, but the market is thinking that all the measures we are waiting for will only take place after the second round," said Fabio Lara, director at Schahin Cury brokerage in Sao Paulo.
Lara said that the Cardoso government doesn't want to announce anything detrimental such as tax increases to its allied candidates in the state governments until they are through the second round of voting.
This time around, the presidential Rolls Royce is staying in the garage.
And forget about champagne, the inauguration will be toasted with locally grown sparkling wine and contraband whiskey seized by customs officials.
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso prepares to be sworn in to a second term in office Friday, but for many here the expectations are as stripped down as the commemorations.
"The difference in sentiment between the first term and the second term are enormous," said Antonio Delfim Neto, a congressman and former finance minister, "In 1995 everything was certainty and hope ,the beginning of the second term is sadder: everything is uncertainty."
On the eve of his 1995 inauguration, Cardoso enjoyed approval ratings of around 70 percent, almost entirely on the strength of the economic plan he devised as finance minister under then President Itamar Franco.
Introduced in July 1994, the plan dropped inflation, then hovering around 50 percent a month, to a single digit almost overnight.
Suddenly one US dollar bought only 82 centavos of a real the local currency and for many Brazilians, beaten down by years of triple digit inflation, it was a heady time.
With new hard currency in their wallets, Brazilians traveled abroad in record numbers and consumption of electronics and other goods grew so quickly there were concerns the economy was overheating.
It was in this climate that Cardoso was overwhelming elected in Oct 1995 and fittingly all the stops were pulled out for his first inauguration with some 6000 people attending the 3 million real (dlrs 2.5 million) gala.
The economic plan received high marks from most economists, but many warned that it would at best provide a window of opportunity in which to address deep seated structural problems.
Cardoso's government proposed constitutional amendments to change the tax system, the pension system and civil service payrolls and shore up the country's burgeoning deficit.
But aside from a constitutional amendment that allowed the president and governors to stand for reelection, something prohibited under the country's 1988 Constitution, the other reforms languished in Congress.
For a while, that wasn't a problem.
Trade and public sector deficits continue to grow, but foreign money was flooding into Brazil faster than ever and the country's reserves swelled from around dlrs 40 billion to above dlrs 70 billion during Cardoso's first three and a half years in office.
The volume on Brazilian stock exchanges more than doubled and leading stock funds boasted returns of over 200 percent a year.
But when financial instability rocked Asia and then Russia last August, the same foreign investment that had swelled the country's foreign reserves left even faster than it came in.
With a dlrs 41.5 International Monetary Fund led bailout package, Brazil may have avoided becoming the latest domino to fall in the financial crisis afflicting Asia and Russia, but the outcome of all the fiscal belt tightening needed to qualify for that aid will almost certainly spell recession in 1999.
Although Cardoso soundly defeated his opponent, leftist Worker's Party candidate Luiz Lula Inacio da Silva, in the first round of last year's October election, his approval rating has sunk by some 17 percentage points in the months since then to around 35 percent.
According to a recent poll by the Datafolha organization, 48 percent of those questioned now expect inflation to rise over the coming months and 66 percent are worried about losing their jobs.
The poll which interviewed 11851 people had a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.
Not surprisingly, Friday's inauguration dinner will be a scaled down affair.
Only 114 people are expected to attend the dinner following Friday's inauguration which is expected to cost 60000 reals (dlrs 50000), or a mere 2 percent of what the first one cost.
Whether Cardoso will be able to steer Brazil and an unruly Congress away from these uncertain shores is anybody's guess, but regardless of what Brazilians think of the job he's doing they're sticking by their captain.
"He got us into this mess, so we'll just have to hope he can get us out," said Luis Fernando Duarte de Morares, an agricultural engineer.
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil Brazilian voters appeared to re elect President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in the first round of balloting Sunday, thus maintaining the leadership of a country struggling against economic crisis.
In preliminary returns, Cardoso appeared to have defeated Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the three time presidential candidate of the leftist Workers Party, with 56 percent of the vote, a far stronger showing than polls initially predicted.
Cabinet members gathering at the presidential palace in Brasilia Sunday night called the vote a mandate for reform, which the president is under national and international pressure to carry out.
With $30 billion having drained from federal reserves since Russia's economic collapse in late August, and the Sao Paulo stock market down more than 40 percent this year, the Brazilian government has been somewhat paralyzed by the approach of elections.
It has been negotiating a bailout with the International Monetary Fund, but has been unable to show progress on structural reforms that would cut government expenses over the long term.
But the waiting is probably not over yet.
The size of his victory strengthens Cardoso's hand for the politically sensitive social security, civil service and tax overhauls ahead.
But, political analysts said, Congress will probably not convene to consider painful economic reforms before important gubernatorial runoffs on Oct 25.
With policy makers at the meetings of the Group of Seven top industrialized nations and the International Monetary Fund in Washington seeking permanent solutions to ward off the volatility that is threatening Brazil after devastating Asia and Russia, Cardoso is expected to start taking steps to put Brazil's accounts in order.
Antonio Carlos Alkimin, a political science professor at Catholic University and chief of population studies at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, said he did not expect that Cardoso could make progress toward restructuring the government before Oct 25, because these measures would require legislative approval.
"What he can do is take measures on the administrative level to cut costs, or to play with controls on currency," Alkimin said.
But Gregg Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential Securities, said that financial markets were not expecting concrete reforms from Brazil in the next few weeks.
"The next thing everybody's going to be watching is whether there is an IMF and World Bank package to support Brazil and whether the Brazilians are starting to take actions to work on the budget deficit," he said.
"If those two things look like they're moving in the right direction, it will begin to calm financial markets."
Sunday's balloting was somewhat confused, with about half the country voting on small shoebox sized computers that elderly voters had trouble mastering.
Though electioneering was required to end before polls opened, most candidates appeared to ignore the prohibition.
At Rocinha, in Rio de Janeiro, believed to be the largest slum in South America with about 300000 residents, palm sized photos of candidates fluttered like autumn leaves through the air and carpeted the streets.
People waited more than an hour to cast their votes, with many supporting Cardoso for re election.
Luiz Claudio Silveira, a 34 year old horse trainer, said he planned to vote for Cardoso, largely because he ended inflation.
"If you go to the supermarket, you can buy whatever you need now," he said.
"Four years is not enough to change a country as big as ours.
I really believe in him."
Rute Vicente Oliveira, a 48 year old manicurist, also planned to vote for Cardoso.
She said that for most of her life, her family lived in a lean to, too poor to build a proper home.
It was her father's dream, she said, and he died before it was realized.
"Now, the house is almost done, it's almost completely in order," she said.
Gilberto Manuel da Silva, 40, who owns an ice cream parlor, said that he expected the economic adjustments that Cardoso announced would hurt him personally, but he was prepared to sacrifice in order to stabilize Brazil's economy.
"I'm thinking more about the situation of the country," da Silva said.
"With a stable money, our situation will get better."
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil Brazilian voters gave President Fernando Henrique Cardoso a comfortable lead in the first round of balloting Sunday, apparently maintaining the leadership of a country struggling against economic crisis.
With 22 percent of the vote counted, Cardoso appeared to have won 51 percent of the vote, compared with 34 percent for his main rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the three time presidential candidate of the leftist Workers Party.
If he still has a majority when returns are complete, Cardoso will be declared re elected without facing a runoff.
Exit polls indicated that he might win as much as 56 percent.

The size of his victory strengthens Cardoso's hand for the politically sensitive social security, civil service and tax overhauls ahead.
But political analysts said Congress would probably not convene to consider the painful economic measures before important gubernatorial runoffs on Oct 25 because the legislators will be busy campaigning for their parties' gubernatorial candidates.

But Gregg Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential Securities in New York, said the international financial markets were not necessarily expecting major changes from Brazil in the next few weeks.
"The next thing everybody's going to be watching is whether there is an IMF and World Bank package to support Brazil, and whether the Brazilians are starting to take actions to work on the budget deficit," he said.
"If those two things look like they're moving in the right direction, it will begin to calm financial markets."

Rute Vicente Oliveira, 48, a manicurist, also planned to vote for Cardoso.
For most of her life, she said, her family lived in a lean to, too poor to build a proper home.
Her father dreamed of giving his family solid, sturdy shelter, Ms Oliveira said, but he died before concrete blocks replaced the family's plywood slats.
"Now the house is almost done," she said.
"It's almost completely in order."
Many voters appeared to be unaware of the fiscal adjustments ahead, though the president announced less than two weeks before the election that government belt tightening measures would be inevitable.
Of the 106 million Brazilians eligible to vote Sunday, nearly 70 percent have less than an elementary school education, and 35 percent are barely literate.
Gilberto Manuel da Silva, 40, who owns an ice cream parlor, said that he expected the economic adjustments to hurt him personally but that he was prepared to sacrifice to stabilize Brazil's economy.
The president said he would cut government costs, crack down on tax evaders and, if necessary, raise taxes to increase revenues.
"I'm thinking more about the situation of the country than of myself," da Silva said.
"With a stable money, our situation will get better."
Taking a major step toward statehood, the Palestinians on Tuesday inaugurated Gaza International Airport, their first gateway to the world, with cheers, tears and an outpouring of patriotism.
An Egypt Air plane was the first to land on the desert tarmac in the southern Gaza Strip at 8:30 a.m. (0630 gmt).
But the emotional highlight was the touchdown of the first Palestinian Airlines plane, a Fokker 50.
After landing, the pilot and co pilot raised Palestinian flags high above their heads as they descended the stairway.
A chant of "Allahu Akbar," or God is Great, rose from of a crowd of thousands of Palestinians who had pushed their way onto the airfield to join the celebrations.
"You are a beautiful sight," Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat later told the Palestinian crew in the VIP lounge lavishly decorated with deep red Oriental carpets and wall mosaics.
Throughout the morning, Arafat walked from the lounge to the tarmac seven times to greet planes from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Spain, the European Union and two Palestinian Airlines flights.
"This is a preparation for the declaration of the Palestinian state," Arafat said, smiling broadly and flashing a V sign.
However, Israel continues to control the airspace and has the authority to shut down the airfield at any time.
It will monitor arriving passengers and cargo, and can keep travelers or goods out if it considers them a danger to Israeli security.
Disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over security had delayed the airport opening for more than two years.
In a sign of cooperation, Israeli and Palestinian security agents approached the Egypt Air jet together Tuesday and collected the passports of the passengers, including Egyptian Cabinet ministers and comedian Adel Imam, in white bags.
Throughout the morning, there were spontaneous celebrations.
As a police marching band played bagpipes, airport workers, policemen and Cabinet ministers held each other by their hands and danced in a circle.
Some kissed and embraced their neighbors, others wiped away tears and several officers waved their rifles in the air.
In one corner of the airfield, about 300 people gathered around a man and a boy riding mules that moved to the beat of drums.
The dlrs 75 million airport will provide a boost to the troubled Palestinian economy, permitting the export of Palestinian flowers and farm produce that until now were shipped out via Israel, often with difficulties and delays.
The airfield will also make it easier for Palestinians to travel abroad, although a majority of Gazans are probably too poor to be able to afford an air ticket.
Until now, Palestinians wanting to fly abroad needed permission to enter Israel and fly out of Ben Gurion International airport near Tel Aviv.
The other option was to travel by land to Jordan and catch flights there.
Palestinians living in the West Bank still need a permit to cross Israel into Gaza to get to the airport.
Travel is expected to become easier once a land route between the West Bank and Gaza opens next month.
Israel's government does not permit Israelis to use the Palestinian airport, citing security reasons.
However, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon said Tuesday that this might change in the future.
The opening of the airport was negotiated during last month's U.S. sponsored Mideast summit near Washington.
As part of the accord, Israel also withdrew troops in the northern West Bank last week and released 250 Palestinian prisoners.
A Palestinian industrial park between Gaza and Israel is to open next month, while Israeli Palestinian negotiations on a Palestinian seaport in Gaza are continuing.
Gaza International, with the call letters LVGZ, was designed in an Oriental style with graceful arches and elaborate tiles imported from Morocco.
The airport has one passenger terminal, a VIP lounge and a three kilometer (two mile) long runway.
A 1 meter (4 foot) tall poster of Arafat hangs from the control tower wall.
Palestine Airlines, with a small fleet that includes one Boeing 727, will begin direct flights to Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia next week.
In the first weeks, airport operations will have to rely on some improvisation.
Major pieces of equipment, including the controls for the control tower, are still held up at the Israeli port of Ashdod.
Tuesday's planes were guided to a safe landing by a portable control panel installed in a van.
Despite its temporary shortcomings, many Palestinians consider the airport a big step toward independence.
For those living in the small, overcrowded Gaza Strip, which is ringed by the Mediterranean on one side and by barbed wire on the other three, it may help ease the feeling of being trapped.
"Now we will be able to travel without the Israeli procedures that we usually must go through," said Khaled Salmeh, who studies economics at Gaza City University and plans to fly next month to Saudi Arabia, for a pilgrimage to Mecca.
BC Israel Palestinians, 1st Ld Israel delays two flights from Palestinian airport Eds: RESTORES dropped word 'marking' from lede Israeli security officials delayed two planes from taking off from the Palestinian airport on Wednesday, marking the latest tensions in a rare area of Israeli Palestinian cooperation.
Israel has threatened to close down the Palestinian run Gaza airport over a security violation, an Israeli official said Tuesday, a move that could further undermine the already fragile peace process.
Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an Egyptian plane Sunday afternoon, most of whom worked for the Palestinian Authority, according to Civilian Airport Authority Director Nir Yarkoni.
"The Transportation Minister asked me to tell the Palestinians that if this continues, we won't allow the airport operate," he told The Associated Press.
Yarkoni said he conveyed the message in a letter sent Monday to chairman of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority Brig.
Gen. Fayez Zeidan.
Zeidan was not immediately available for comment.
Israel retains security control over flights arriving to Gaza International Airport.
The airport's opening last month, stipulated by the accords brokered by U.S. President Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in October, was hailed by Palestinians as a milestone toward independence and statehood.
Since then, Israel has accused the Palestinians of failing to contain anti Israel violence, and has frozen the accords.
The Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement to release Palestinians jailed for anti Israel activities.
Israeli security officials delayed two planes from taking off from the Palestinian airport on Wednesday, the latest tensions in a rare area of Israeli Palestinian cooperation.
A plane bound for Amman, Jordan was delayed for two hours over an Israeli demand that Palestinian officials inspect the luggage of a Palestinian passenger, Israel radio reported.
The plane left with the passenger aboard, but without his luggage.
Israeli officials also delayed a plane making a stopover from Saudi Arabia to Cairo, it said.
Israeli airport security officials were not available for comment.
Abdel Razek Yehia, a Palestinian official who helped negotiate the airport's opening, confirmed the delays.
He said such differences did not undermine the peace process.
"Every day we have differences," he told The Associated Press.
"We are all doing all our best to continue the peace process."

Israel retains security control over flights arriving at Gaza International Airport, and Palestinian security officials consult with their Israeli counterparts.
Earlier this week, Israel threatened to close down the Gaza airport when Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an Egyptian plane, most of whom worked for the Palestinian Authority.
Palestinian officials said that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his entourage were aboard the plane in question, and that exempted the plane from Israeli security checks.

RAFAH, Gaza Palestinians celebrated with euphoria the long delayed opening of their international airport Tuesday as a parade of planes swooped down from cottony skies and glided to a literal red carpet landing in the flatlands of Gaza.
With brass bands, bag pipes and grandiloquent speeches, Palestinian officials made it clear that they see the sleekly modern airport as the most concrete symbol yet of their fledgling sovereignty.
The high emotion and pageantry Tuesday stood in stark contrast to the muted response last week to an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
"This is my day of great joy as a Palestinian refugee," said Ahmad Abdel Rachman, the general secretary of the Palestinian Cabinet.
"I am standing on Palestinian soil, and I have an airport, I have a flag, I have an airplane.
This is our path to the independent Palestinian state."
The airport, a potential economic lifeline to the depressed Gaza Strip, was completed more than a year ago, with about $60 million in grants from Egypt and Morocco as well as from Spain and other European Union countries.
But its fate became mired in the stalemated peace talks until the peace memorandum signed in Washington last month provided a breakthrough.
The Gaza International Airport, with 400 employees, will open for regular business next week.
Royal Air Maroc is expected to begin Gaza Casablanca service.
And the Palestinian National Airline will fly routes to Amman, Cairo and Jidda with three planes: two Fokker 50s donated by the Netherlands, and a 20 year old Boeing 727 given by Saudi Prince Walled bin Talal.
There are 20 pilots, most with Egyptian flying certificates.
"It may look like a little airport to you, but to us, it's bigger than John F. Kennedy," said Nabil Shurafa, a travel agent in Gaza City.
The alabaster towers of the new airport rise from a particularly hardscrabble stretch of southern Gaza near the Egyptian border.
Thousands of local residents pushed at its gates Tuesday morning, begging to be let into the closed ceremony, gaping at the elaborate, Moroccan style architecture, and ducking with the whoosh of each landing plane.
For Mafa Barbakh, an elderly woman wrapped in black from head to toe, the moment was too important to experience from afar.
Like many, she said she had never even seen a plane before.
She wanted to be on the tarmac, to ululate and raise her hands to the heavens.
She finally did, when the gates were opened and the Palestinians swarmed the grounds chanting, dancing, laying down prayer rugs and otherwise making it their own.
"I want to fly to Mecca," she said.
"I hope God gives me this gift, to go up in the sky like a bird, on Palestinian wings.
Hey, we have Palestinian passports now.
I can travel with my Palestinian passport on a Palestinian plane.
This is Palestine!"
At 8:30 a.m., with a punctuality remarkable for Gaza, the first of seven planes landed: a white Airbus from Egypt, disgorging government officials and three actors.
One, a comedian, Adel Imam, caused the the Palestine National Airline's entire staff of flight attendants 18 women in navy pants suits and Muslim head scarves to jump up and down and squeal.
Aircraft carrying delegations from other principal donors to the project followed: the Jordanians, the Moroccans, the Spanish, the Dutch and, aboard an Israeli charter, some European Union officials.
The bagpipes, a holdover from the days of the British Mandate, seemed a disconcerting greeting to many who strode down the red carpet past upturned bayonets on their way into the V.I.P. lounge to see Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
Last week, the airport was named Yasser Arafat International Airport by Arafat's aides, and signs were duly posted.
But the Palestinian leader was not pleased.
The signs were taken down, and the original entry banner restrung: Gaza International Airport, it said Tuesday.
The V.I.P. lounge, a lavish building decorated with Moroccan mosaics, crystal chandeliers and a fountain, bears a gilded dome atop its roof, meant to echo the Dome of the Rock Mosque in Jerusalem.
In a way that irked Israeli officials, Jerusalem was itself a constant theme as Palestinian officials got swept away by the moment.
"God willing, we will open the Jerusalem Airport next," Arafat said.
"God willing, we will land soon at the Jerusalem Airport."
The fate of Jerusalem will be debated in the final status peace talks, which began last week.
The Israelis say it will remain undivided, but the Palestinians want to reclaim East Jerusalem, annexed by Israel in 1967, as the capital of their eventual state.
Last week, under the peace memorandum signed in Washington, the first phase of a three part Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank tripled the amount of territory under complete Palestinian control.
Still, it was sparsely populated, rural land dotted with small towns and villages.
The Palestinian response was quiet, and Arafat received only two calls of congratulations from world leaders: one from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the other from a Norwegian official.
On Tuesday, in contrast, a who's who of the Palestinian leadership, flanked by dignitaries from the Arab world and Europe, declared the airport's opening a milestone, while the Palestinian police danced with their rifles in the air.
The officials said it would ease the claustrophobia of Gazans, who feel locked into their dusty strip of territory by Israeli border checkpoints most do not have permits to cross.
"These people in Gaza have been living in this ghetto since 1948," Abdel Rachman said, talking with foreign reporters.
"More than 60 to 70 percent have never left.
Now with free access to the rest of the world, they will feel they're human, like all of you."
During the year and a half delay before the airport opened, the Palestinian airline operated on a limited basis out of El Arish in Egypt.
Passengers traveled by bus across the border and often waited hours before departure.
Most business travelers flew out of Cairo, those who imported goods relied on Israeli ports or the airport in Tel Aviv.
"Now I'll be able to travel like a regular businessman, on overnight trips," Sayeed el Madhoun, who owns a floor covering company, said while videotaping the ceremony.
"And it'll make it easier and cheaper to bring materials in and out."
When the airport opens for regular service next week, there will still be difficulties to resolve.
Some $15 million in donated equipment, including radar and high tech air traffic control devices, has been held up in a dispute between Israel and the donor nations.
Most of it has sat in the port of Ashdod for the last year.
Now the Port Authority of Israel is demanding $650000 in storage fees to release it.
And about $3 million in night landing equipment donated by Germany has been held in Hamburg because the Germans fear similar difficulties with Israeli customs and security officials.
As a result, the airport will at first handle only daylight flights.
Also, the Israelis will retain considerable control over routes, flight schedules and security.
Israeli aviation officials, in fact, have described the Gaza airport as a new airport under Israel's jurisdiction.
As they do at some of the land crossings into Jordan, the Israelis will operate a kind of shadow document checking system.
Palestinian officials will review passengers' documents, passing them behind a screen to Israelis.
Fadda Jabr, a former negotiator for the Palestinian Authority, brushed aside those issues as mere "technical difficulties."
"Today is the concrete evidence of the success of the camp of peace," he said.
"Now the ink of the agreement has turned into something we can see, we can touch and we can admire.
Lovely, isn't it?"
RAFAH, Gaza Strip Cruising at 19000 feet on Saturday in the cockpit of the first Palestinian Airlines flight to depart from Gaza's new international airport, Capt.
Jamal Al How from the Jabaliya refugee camp could not restrain himself.
"At this historic moment, taking off for the first time in history from a Palestinian airport, all the languages of the world cannot express my pride and joy," he declared.
"I thank the heroic Palestinian people, which sacrificed everything it had so that we could reach this moment."
Earlier, applause rang through the cabin as the 48 seat Fokker 50 propeller plane, painted with the Palestinian national colors of red, green, black and white, took to the air.
Mohammad Abdel Salam from Bethlehem, the steward, greeted the passengers of Flight 152, inaugurating regular service from the Gaza airport, which was ceremonially opened last month.
"Welcome aboard the first flight from Yasser Arafat International Airport, bound for Amman," Abdel Salam said over the loudspeaker.
"Thank you for choosing Palestinian Airlines, and we wish you all a pleasant flight."
Times have changed.
In the not too distant past, the combination of the words "Palestinian" and "airplane" evoked images of gun waving hijackers from the PLO.
Now the Palestinians are running their own airline from Gaza, with planes flown by former PLO pilots, and Palestinian security men checking bags and passengers for would be terrorists.
Established in 1996, the tiny Palestinian airline was an outgrowth of the accords with Israel on Palestinian self rule.
It has two Fokker 50s received from the Netherlands, and a Boeing 727 donated by Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, which is still being prepared for service.
Starting operations in 1997 without a home airport, the airline's first flights left from Port Said in Egypt, ferrying Muslim pilgrims to Saudi Arabia.
Regular service began a few months later from the Egyptian town of El Arish to Amman and to the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah.
Departing passengers had to make a night long trek by bus from Gaza to El Arish, moving slowly through Palestinian, Israeli and Egyptian checkpoints to board flights that took far less time than the ground journey.
Flying from Gaza for the first time on Saturday, passengers remarked on the simple convenience of going directly from home to their local airport, avoiding Israeli interrogations and security checks at border crossings and at Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv, Israel.
It enhanced their sense that, while there was no Palestinian state yet, something like one was emerging from the often troubled negotiations with Israel.
"I drove here with my family, like anyone else in the world," said Ahmad al Ghandour, a department head in the Palestinian Authority.
"I'm leaving like people do everywhere else, on your own plane, with your own passport."
Mahfouz Othman, a psychiatrist from Rafah, said that he was relieved of the anxiety that often plagued his departures in the past, when he was worried that he might be turned back or detained.
"I feel that I'm keeping my dignity, these are Palestinians like us," he said as he handed his passport to a Palestinian police officer.
"At a personal, human level, this is a changing point in our lives."
Not entirely.
A short while after Othman spoke, Palestinian security officers and Israeli counterparts keeping watch at the airport got into a dispute about departure procedures, delaying take off for three and a half hours.
Fayez Zaidan, the airline chairman, came to the passenger lounge to encourage his customers.
"We are with you facing the Israelis," he told them.
"This is your airport."
In the end, the passengers were bused to the adjacent Rafah border terminal where they went through passport control under Israeli supervision, before returning to the plane.
A few hours later, returning passengers were delayed two hours at the same terminal for Israeli security and document checks.
But the first day hitches did not mar the patriotic spirit on the first flight from Gaza, and its passengers were greeted with roses in Amman.
Regular flights to Jeddah and Cairo, Egypt, are scheduled to start in the next few days.
The airline expects to carry thousands to the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia in March, and there are long range plans to expand service to Cyprus, Turkey and Greece.
"I always imagined that it would come," said Zaidan, who is also head of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority.
"There were many obstacles and difficulties.
I'm very happy that I could achieve this goal of establishing a civil aviation authority from zero, an airport from zero, an airline from zero.
We did it."
The company has sent some of its 400 employees to train in Morocco and Jordan, but the core of its crews and staff served in what was once the air wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization, or worked in airlines in the Arab world.
Palestinians also gained experience in the 1980s in Maldives Airways, which was effectively owned by the PLO, and in Air Bissau, a government owned carrier in Africa in which the PLO was a major partner.
When it was still a guerrilla movement, the PLO sent volunteers to flight academies in Pakistan and Yugoslavia, and in the 1980s, Palestinian fighter pilots served in the air forces of Syria, Libya and Yemen.
The PLO air fleet consisted then of small transport planes and helicopters, used mostly for travel between the organization's headquarters.
"Like any revolution struggling for freedom, we were fighting for the liberation of Palestine," said Yassin al Hawamdi, a pilot.
"Now we're building up a state."
For now, however, Palestinians do not control their skies.
Take offs and landings must be reported to the Israelis.
Flights from Gaza are barred from crossing Israel's southern air space because there are military installations en route, compelling flights to Amman to detour over the Sinai peninsula, meaning that they take about 90 minutes.
Sophisticated landing equipment is still being held in an Israeli port, and planes only land and take off at the Gaza airport in daylight.
Yet for the Palestinian Airlines staff, operating their national carrier from their soil is a source of great satisfaction.
"I have traveled everywhere, to 70 countries," said Abdel Salam, the steward, who worked 15 years in Kuwait Airways.
"Now I feel different.
I'm taking care of my own people.
We waited a long time to realize our dream."
RAFAH, Gaza Strip Cruising at 19000 feet on Saturday in the cockpit of the first Palestinian Airlines flight to depart from Gaza's new international airport, Capt.
Jamal Al How from the Jabaliya refugee camp could not restrain himself.
"At this historic moment, taking off for the first time in history from a Palestinian airport, all the languages of the world cannot express my pride and joy," he declared.

Israel has threatened to close down the Palestinian run Gaza airport over a security violation, an Israeli official said Tuesday, a move that could further undermine the already fragile peace process.
Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an Egyptian plane Sunday afternoon, most of whom worked for the Palestinian Authority, according to Civilian Airport Authority Director Nir Yarkoni.
"The Transportation Minister asked me to tell the Palestinians that if this continues, we won't allow the airport operate," he told The Associated Press.
Yarkoni said he conveyed the message in a letter Monday to chairman of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority Brig.
Gen. Fayez Zeidan.
Zeidan was not immediately available for comment.
Israel retains security control over flights arriving to Gaza International Airport.
The airport's opening last month, stipulated by the accords brokered by U.S. President Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in October, was hailed by Palestinians as a milestone toward independence and statehood.
Since then, Israel has accused the Palestinians of failing to contain anti Israel violence, and has frozen the accords.
The Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement to release Palestinians jailed for anti Israel activities.
The first Palestinian commercial flight landed at Amman's Marka Airport on Saturday, inaugurating an air route between Jordan and the autonomous Gaza Strip.
The Falcon F 50 short haul plane carried 48 passengers, mostly Palestinian businessmen and students.
The plane will return later in the day.
Last weekend, the Palestinians inaugurated an airport in the Mediterranean city of Gaza under the U.S. brokered Wye River accord which envisages Israel ceding more lands to the Palestinians in return for security guarantees.
Jasser Ziyyad, director general of the Jordanian Civil Aviation Authority, said Jordan agreed with the Palestinians earlier in the week on four weekly flights between them two by the Palestinian airline and two for Jordan.
Meanwhile, Jordanian newspapers quoted unnamed Palestinian aviation officials as saying one more passenger plane will be added to the Palestinian fleet of three short haul aircraft.
It said the addition was necessary to transport an estimated 3600 Palestinian Muslims who wish to travel to Saudi Arabia in early March to perform the annual pilgrimage to holy shrines in that country.
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who ruled Chile as a despot for 17 years, has been arrested in London after Spain asked that he be extradited for the presumed murders of hundreds of Chilean and Spanish citizens, the British authorities announced Saturday.
The Chilean government immediately demanded his release, arguing that he has diplomatic immunity since he sits in the Chilean Senate.
But so far the British and Spanish authorities have shrugged off the protests, setting up what promises to be a legal struggle that could have wide implications for the prosecution of alleged human rights violators under international law.
Pinochet, who is 82 and who stepped down as commander in chief of the Chilean military five months ago, was arrested by the British police on Friday night, little more than a week after he arrived in London for surgery on a herniated disc.
The warrant said the general was wanted for questioning for "crimes of genocide and terrorism that includes murder."
British authorities refused to say where Pinochet is being held, nor did they set a date for when he would be questioned.
Ever since he led a violent coup to overthrow Salvador Allende Gossens, the elected Socialist president in 1973, Pinochet has been a political icon throughout Latin America, representing the excesses of a long period of military rule and U.S. support for right wing strongmen who opposed Communism.
An estimated 3000 Chileans were shot in the streets or "disappeared" during his rule, and a senior member of his regime was imprisoned under U.S. pressure for the murder of former Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier in Washington in 1976.
Pinochet cast a long and wide shadow in economic affairs as well, launching a privatized social security system and other free market policies that set examples that are still models from Argentina to Mexico.
Under a Constitution that he guided to enactment, Pinochet was able to become a senator for life upon his retirement from the military, a position that afforded him continued political influence and immunity from prosecution.
Relatives of disappeared people and political opponents have filed several lawsuits in Chile seeking to take away his immunity, but they are given little chance of success.
To this day, Chileans are deeply divided in their opinion of the Pinochet legacy, with approximately a third of the country viewing him as a hero, another third viewing him as a villain and the rest voicing ambiguous opinions to pollsters.
A senior Spanish judicial official said Saturday that Judge Baltasar Garzon issued the international arrest warrant against Pinochet on Friday after Interpol warned that the former dictator was about to be released from the hospital and would probably leave London.
A British Foreign Office spokesman, who declined to be identified by name, said the general's arrest was "a judicial matter, one for the police and the magistrates."
But he said "one point that does fall to us, he does not have diplomatic immunity in this country."
The spokesman declined any further comment.
An official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Pinochet had been arrested "at the direct, specific request of the Spanish authorities."
Spanish lawyers said the request for Pinochet's extradition had been sent to Scotland Yard through Interpol.
The request was based on the European Convention on Terrorism, which requires members to help one another in matters related to terrorism.
The initial warrant is based on a single case of the kidnapping and disappearance in 1976 of a Chilean leftist leader, Edgaro Henriquez, 35.
The Spanish judicial official said that Garzon is planning on Monday to send to British authorities the names of 78 other people of various nationalities who were also kidnapped in Chile and taken to Argentina where they disappeared between 1976 and 1983.
He will also seek the general's extradition to Spain.
Garzon has also demanded the extradition of various former Argentina junta rulers, but Argentina has refused to abide by warrants.
The focus of his investigation is the so called Condor Plan, in which the military juntas of various Latin American countries allegedly collaborated to eliminate their enemies.
Both President Eduardo Frei of Chile and President Eduardo Menem of Argentina have resisted the Spanish legal motions, arguing that they infringe on their nations' sovereignty.
Amnesty International, the human rights group long critical of Pinochet, earlier this week urged the British government to assist the Spanish judges in their prosecution of the former dictator.
In a statement, the group said, "This would be a clear manifestation of the British government's commitment to human rights."
Human rights and international law experts expressed enthusiastic support Saturday for the British arrest, and said it could have wide implications.
Legal experts noted that since the Nuremberg trials after World War II, all countries theoretically have been obliged to take responsibility for crimes against humanity, thereby denying safe haven to promoters of international crimes like genocide.
However, suspected war criminals, once granted amnesties in their own countries, have usually been safe from prosecution when they traveled abroad.
Juan Garces, a Spanish lawyer representing 4000 victims of the Pinochet regime, said the case against the general was based on international legal principles that there is no immunity for those responsible for crimes against humanity, even if they served as heads of state.
Diane Orentlicher, a law professor and director of the War Crimes Research Office at American University in Washington, said the British and Spanish actions put "teeth into the legal principle" that abusers of human rights are international criminals.
"The central point of all of this is that crimes against humanity transcend the concerns of the countries where the abuses are committed," she said.
"In theory, there should be no safe haven for world class criminals, but the central problem has been the enforcement of the law depends on the mobilization of the world's consciousness."
Chile said on Saturday that it would file a formal protest.
"What we must do is make clear that Mr Pinochet is a senator who travels with a diplomatic passport," said Mario Artaza, Chile's ambassador to London, in a radio interview Saturday.
Artaza added that Pinochet would not be able testify any time soon because he was recuperating from painful surgery.
Chilean officials who served in the Pinochet government have so far been left virtually untouched for their alleged crimes because the armed forces still command broad political influence.
In neighboring Argentina, several military officials served prison sentences in the 1980s, but they were released under amnesty laws enacted in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
However, retired Gen. Jorge Videla, who led one of the Argentine juntas that ruled while Pinochet was in power in Chile, is currently under house arrest as a judge investigates his alleged role in kidnapping newborn children of political prisoners so they might be adopted by military families.
SANTIAGO, Chile Perhaps as a sign of how much Chileans wish to forget their years of polarized politics and repression under Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the immediate popular response here to the sensational news of his arrest in London has been remarkable for its moderation.
About 200 supporters of the retired dictator gathered at the residence of the British ambassador on Saturday evening to protest the arrest, some throwing fruit and eggs at the building.
Some demonstrators burned a British flag in front of the nearby residence of the Spanish ambassador before the police arrived in a truck with water cannon, at which point the protesters obediently withdrew.
Chilean television news repeatedly showed the same videotape of a leftist counterdemonstrator in heated discussions with the protesting Pinochet supporters before he was arrested and carried kicking and screaming into a police van.
But in a display of uncensored political debate that would have been unthinkable only a decade ago under the general's rule, television broadcasts also showed myriad reactions to the arrest from political figures ranging from Communist Party leaders to rightist retired generals.
Many Chileans still harbor bitter memories of Pinochet's dictatorial ways, including the deaths and disappearances of more than 3000 people in the 17 years that followed his violent overthrow of the elected Socialist government of President Salvador Allende in 1973.
But most political analysts say a large majority wants to put the era of radical politics and repression behind it, a trend equally apparent in neighboring Argentina and Brazil, which also went through periods of rule by military juntas.
President Eduardo Frei Ruiz Tagle, in Portugal for a summit meeting of Iberian and Latin American leaders, charged that Britain was breaking international law, saying that Pinochet, now an unelected senator for life, carried a diplomatic passport giving him legal immunity.
Frei leads a governing coalition that includes Christian Democrats and Socialists, and his strong defense of the general's rights was only one of a string of similar comments from civilian politicians who have spent most of their political careers opposing Pinochet.
Only one presidential candidate in next year's elections expressed support for the Spanish and British actions, and that was Gladys Marin of the Communist Party.
"I couldn't be more happy," she told local television.
"This government has been unwilling to bring this genocidal criminal to justice over the last eight years, so it is up to the Spanish to do it."
The leading leftist candidate, Ricardo Lagos of the Socialist Party, was far more cautious.
Lagos gently scolded Pinochet for not anticipating his arrest abroad but said he did want to get involved in a judicial matter.
Effectively, Lagos was walking a tight line in order to deflect conservatives' claims that his election would return Chile to the political and economic turbulence of Allende's abbreviated rule.
The two leading conservative candidates predictably criticized the arrest, and some rightist politicians urged the government to break relations with London in protest.
Supporters of Pinochet pledged to mobilize street demonstrations demanding his release, while the Communist Party and human rights groups promised marches supporting the British action and a possible Spanish prosecution for alleged crimes against humanity.
But Sunday was just another Sunday for most Chileans, who packed Santiago's parks on a splendidly sunny spring day.
A few lightly armed police officers directed traffic away from the British and Spanish embassies, and flimsy three feet high wire fences were placed around the buildings.
Attempting to explain the calm, Mireya Garcia, secretary general of the Group of the Families of the Detained and Disappeared, said: "After 25 years of absolute impunity for violators of human rights, it takes a while for the people to absorb this news and understand its importance and dimensions."
For all the normalcy, the arrest of Pinochet opened a revealing window into a new Chilean society, one run by democratically elected civilians side by side with a still influential military.
President Fidel Castro of Cuba, who for years was portrayed as the devil incarnate in the Chilean media, was shown on television in a very human light, reacting to the arrest with confused amusement.
News clips of Chilean exiles celebrating the arrest received prominent play.
Their shouts of "murderer" and posters of the former dictator bearing the word "Wanted" were broadcast on the same show that included an interview with Augusto Pinochet Hiriart, Pinochet's son.
"Countries have lost wars and committed real genocide," he said, "but that is not what happened here."
President Fidel Castro said Sunday he disagreed with the arrest in London of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, calling it a case of "international meddling."
Castro compared the action with the establishment in Rome in August of an International Criminal Court, a move Cuba has expressed reservations about.
"It seems to me that what has happened there (in London) is universal meddling," Castro told reporters covering the Ibero American summit being held here Sunday.
Castro had just finished breakfast with King Juan Carlos of Spain in a city hotel.
He said the case seemed to be "unprecedented and unusual."
Pinochet, 82, was placed under arrest in London Friday by British police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge.
The judge is probing Pinochet's role in the death of Spaniards in Chile under his rule in the 1970s and 80s.
Castro, Latin America's only remaining authoritarian leader, said he lacked details on the case against Pinochet, but said he thought it placed the government of Chile and President Eduardo Frei in an uncomfortable position while Frei is attending the summit.
Castro said the International Criminal Court ought to be independent of the U.N. Security Council, because "we already know who commands there," an obvious reference to the United States.
The United States was one of only seven countries that voted against creating the court.
"The (Pinochet) case is serious ,the problem is delicate" and the reactions of the Chilean Parliament and armed forces bear watching, Castro said.
He expressed surprise that the British had arrested Pinochet, especially since he had provided support for England during its 1982 war with Argentina over the Malvina or Falkland Islands.
Although Chile maintained neutrality during the war, it was accused of providing military intelligence to the British.
Castro joked that he would have thought police could have waited another 24 hours to avoid having the arrest of Pinochet overshadow the summit being held here.
"Now they are talking about the arrest of Pinochet instead of the summit," he said.
Pinochet left government in 1990, but remained as army chief until March when he became a senator for life.
The Chilean government has protested Pinochet's arrest, insisting that as a senator he was traveling on a diplomatic passport and had immunity from arrest.
LONDON Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator arrested here at the request of a Spanish judge, remained sequestered under police guard Sunday, awaiting a potentially devastating court hearing to weigh his extradition on charges of genocide, terrorism and murder.
British officials have not said where Pinochet is, but scores of Chilean emigres gathered Sunday outside the upscale London Clinic where the 82 year old general underwent back surgery Oct 9.
The demonstrators jubilantly demanded Pinochet's extradition to Spain and held up photographs of some of the "disappeared" among the 3000 people shot or abducted during his 17 year dictatorship, from 1973 to 1990.
Pinochet's detention late Friday has left Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government seemingly embarrassed by the diplomatic implications of an arrest that has enraged the government of Chile which Britain regards as an ally and confronted European officials with uncomfortable implications for their handling of human rights violators from closer to home.
"What goes for Gen. Pinochet also goes for all the Mladics and Karadzics who are still in hiding and will be, one day or another, arrested and judged for their crimes," said Jacques Poos, the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, referring to the Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb leaders indicted on war crimes charges by the United Nations War Crime Tribunal in The Hague.
Both have consistently eluded arrest.
Britain, however, seemed uncomfortable about turning the general's detention into any new crusade.
Neither Blair nor Foreign Secretary Robin Cook made public statements about the arrest, sheltering behind official statements that it was purely a "judicial matter."
The arrest has reopened a traditional divide between Labor and the opposition Tories who, while in office until 1997, regularly allowed Pinochet to enter Britain without fanfare either for medical treatment or to pursue arms deals with British defense contractors.
Blair's government had been under strong pressure from Labor supporters and human rights groups to display its public commitment to ethical foreign policies by acting against Pinochet.
Word of his presence here produced an outcry in newspapers generally supportive of Labor and among Labor legislators.
Indeed, Trade Minister Peter Mandelson termed Pinochet a "brutal dictator" in a television interview Sunday and said his claim of diplomatic immunity against arrest "for most people in this country would be pretty gut wrenching stuff."
But Michael Howard, a former Tory Interior Minister who took no action during Pinochet's earlier visits, said the arrest reflected the behavior of "a very arrogant government" that may be "displaying its utter contempt for our legal system and for the rule of law" to appease a political constituency.
Pinochet was placed under arrest after a senior Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, sent a request to detain him in connection with possible extradition hearings.
The warrant on which he was arrested alleges that Pinochet "did murder Spanish citizens in Chile within the jurisdiction of the government of Spain," and was guilty of "crimes of genocide and terrorism that includes murder."
Garzon and a Spanish colleague, Judge Manuel Garcia Castellon, are expected to travel to London to question him, possibly in the next few days.
Chile has protested the arrest, insisting that, as a senator for life, Pinochet enjoyed diplomatic immunity under his diplomatic passport.
But, said Alun Michael, a senior official in the Home Office, "a diplomatic passport does not, of course, guarantee diplomatic immunity."
British officials deny that the detention was politically inspired.
Michael said Sunday that "there has been no intervention which has been inappropriate at all."
Under British law, the authorities must decide within 40 days whether to proceed with extradition.
The first step is a magistrates' court hearing where Pinochet's accusers set out their reasons for extradition.
No date for this hearing has been set.
Then, Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, must decide whether to order the extradition.
Eight years after his turbulent regime ended, former Chilean strongman Gen. Augusto Pinochet is being called to account by Spanish authorities for the deaths, detention and torture of political opponents.
Responding to a Spanish extradition warrant, British police announced Saturday they have arrested Pinochet on allegations that he murdered an unidentified number of Spaniards in Chile between Sept 11, 1973, the year he seized power, and Dec 31, 1983.
No reason for the dates was given.
Chile said it would protest to British authorities, arguing that the 82 year old senator for life has diplomatic immunity.
But Britain said Pinochet did not have diplomatic immunity.
Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said it was "a matter for the magistrates and the police."
Pinochet, whose ruthless regime was widely criticized for its human rights record, was recovering from surgery in a London clinic when he was held Friday night.
No hearing date has been set.
Scotland Yard refused to confirm Pinochet's whereabouts, but his Santiago spokesman Fernando Martinez said he was in a London clinic when police came for him.
A regular visitor to Britain, Pinochet underwent surgery Oct 9 for a herniated disc, a spinal disorder which has given him pain and hampered his walking in recent months.
In a statement issued in Porto, Portugal, where President Eduardo Frei is attending the Ibero American summit, the Chilean government said it is "filing a formal protest with the British government for what it considers a violation of the diplomatic immunity which Sen Pinochet enjoys."
The statement, read by acting foreign minister Mariano Fernandez, demanded "that steps be taken to allow an early end of this situation."
Chile has previously said it does not recognize the authority of foreign courts over incidents within Chile.
Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, also attending the Ibero American summit, said his government "respects the decisions taken by courts."
British law recognizes two types of immunity: state immunity, which covers heads of state and government members on official visits, and diplomatic immunity for persons accredited as diplomats.
Jeremy Corbyn, a lawmaker from Britain's governing Labor Party, applauded the arrest.
"It will be the first time this ghastly dictator has faced questions," he told Sky television.
"He is one of the great murderers of this century."
Richard Bunting of the human rights group Amnesty International, which has frequently criticized Pinochet, said the British government was "under obligation to take legal action" against him.
It was not immediately clear which clinic was treating Pinochet, who is 83 next week.
Staff at the London Bridge Hospital, where he reportedly had surgery, refused comment.
He has a pacemaker and hearing aid, but is generally in good health.
Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish magistrates handling probes into human rights violations in Chile and Argentina, filed a request to question Pinochet on Wednesday, a day after another judge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, filed a similar petition.
Castellon's probe into murder, torture and disappearances in Chile during Pinochet's regime began in 1996. Garzon is also investigating the disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in Argentina during the 1976 83 military dictatorships.
Pinochet is implicated in Garzon's probe through his involvement in "Operation Condor," in which military regimes in Chile, Argentina and Uruguay coordinated anti leftist campaigns Pinochet, the son of a customs clerk who ousted elected President Salvador Allende in a bloody 1973 coup, remained commander in chief of the Chilean army until March, when he was sworn in as a senator for life, a post established for him in a constitution drafted by his regime.
While in power he also pushed through an amnesty covering crimes committed before 1978, when most of his human rights abuses allegedly took place.
One official report says 3197 political opponents died during his term and 1102 people remain unaccounted for after being detained by his security agents.
An influential lawmaker from the governing Labor Party on Saturday backed Spanish requests to question former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, in London for back surgery, on allegations of genocide and terrorism.
"There've been something like a total of 3197 cases" of murder and torture during Pinochet's 1973 90 regime, Ann Clywd said in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
"In the course of a long search by their relatives, the remains of some of the disappeared have been discovered in unmarked graves," said Ms Clywd, who chairs an all party committee of lawmakers on human rights.
"And hundreds of former detainees have made statements confirming that the disappeared were held in detention centers."
"Clearly, the Spanish authorities have every right to try and investigate these matters further."
Pinochet, 82, who underwent surgery for a herniated disc a week ago, was reported to have left London Bridge Hospital earlier Wednesday.
British authorities have declined to comment on his whereabouts or the Spanish requests.
Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish magistrates handling probes into human rights violations in Chile and Argentina, filed a request to question Pinochet on Wednesday.
Another judge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, filed a request to question Pinochet a day earlier.
In 1996, Castellon opened his probe into murder, torture and disappearances in Chile during Pinochet's regime.
Garzon is also investigating the disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in Argentina during the 1976 83 military dictatorships.
Pinochet, who ousted elected President Salvador Allende in a bloody 1973 coup, remained commander in chief of the Chilean army until March, when he was sworn in as a senator for life, a post established for him in a constitution drafted by his regime.
British police said Saturday they have arrested former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet on allegations of murdering Spanish citizens during his years in power.
Pinochet, 82, in London for surgery, was held Friday night after British authorities received a Spanish extradition warrant, a Scotland Yard spokeswoman said.
The warrant charges that between Sept 11 1973, the year he seized power, and Dec 31, 1983, Pinochet murdered Spanish citizens in Chile, the spokeswoman said, speaking anonymously.
The spokeswoman refused to confirm Pinochet's whereabouts, but Pinochet's press secretary in Santiago said he being held in the London clinic where he underwent surgery for a herniated disc on Oct 9.
No hearing date has been set.
Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, attending the Ibero American summit in Porto, Portugal, said his government "respects the decisions taken by courts."
But Chilean Ambassador to London, Mario Artaza, said he will seek the release of Pinochet "what we must do is make it clear that Mr Pinochet is a senator, who travels with a diplomatic passport," Artaza said.
The government has previously said that Chile does not recognize the authority of foreign courts over situations which occurred in Chile.
Pinochet, who turns 83 next month, was reported to have left London Bridge Hospital on Wednesday.
But his press secretary Fernando Martinez said he was at the clinic Friday night when police came for him.

Castellon's probe into murder, torture and disappearances in Chile during Pinochet's regime began in 1996. Garzon is also investigating the disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in Argentina during the 1976 83 military dictatorships.
Pinochet is implicated in Garzon's probe through his involvement in "Operation Condor," in which military regimes in Chile, Argentina and Uruguay coordinated anti leftist campaigns The judges' petitions are based on the European Convention on Terrorism which requires signatories to cooperate with each others' judicial processes in cases of terrorism, according to Juan Garces, a lawyer involved in the Spanish investigation into human rights violations in Chile.
Pinochet, who ousted elected President Salvador Allende in a bloody 1973 coup, remained commander in chief of the Chilean army until March, when he was sworn in as a senator for life, a post established for him in a constitution drafted by his regime.
PARIS A stubbornly independent judge who more than once has challenged the Spanish government, Baltasar Garzon was ridiculed when he first set out to pursue the most notorious right wing generals in South America for human rights crimes committed in the 1970s and '80s, offenses for which they had already been granted amnesty at home.
Now, after Garzon succeeded in getting Scotland Yard to arrest Chile's former dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the Spanish magistrate has suddenly moved closer to creating an important legal precedent, one that could make the retirement of former dictators decidedly uncomfortable.
While this is certainly his most spectacular strike, the Madrid judge has long been at the center of controversy.
Even before taking on the cases against former military rulers in Argentina as well as Chile, he had earned a high profile in Spain by investigating some of the country's most explosive issues, among them drug trafficking, Basque terrorism and government corruption.
The judge, despite his professorial look, lives a tense life and has said that he had to grow used to living with death threats.
He moves around with bodyguards and works under tight security in the offices of the Madrid special criminal tribunal, known as the National Court.
His critics have often accused him of self promotion because he takes on major cases and frequently appears on the front pages of newspapers.
But Garzon, in a recent interview, responded that he is determined to expose crime in high places too easily overlooked and that in talking to the media he helps to prevent sensitive cases from being covered up.
His involvement with South America began in 1996 when he opened a criminal investigation after several Spanish legal associations asked him to look into the torture, disappearance and killing of Spanish citizens in Argentina during that country's military rule from 1976 to 1983. Garzon, who works as an investigating magistrate rather than a judge on the bench, took more than five months to conclude that a Spanish court could have jurisdiction in the case.
He argued that, under Spanish and international law, specifically under the Geneva Conventions, serious crimes involving human rights can be tried anywhere and are not subject to any time limit.
Garzon felt encouraged not only by support from international legal scholars and a U.N. committee, but also by the new efforts of Western powers to insure trials and punishment for those responsible for grave human rights violations, including genocide, in Rwanda and the Balkans.
Soon, he brought charges against 110 former and active military and police officers in Argentina and issued international arrest warrants against at least 11 senior Argentine military officers, including a former president, Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri.
That meant countries that are part of the Interpol agreement would have to arrest the officers if they traveled outside Argentina.
Following the case against Argentina's security forces, another judge serving in the same court as Garzon opened an investigation into the torture and killing of Spaniards in Chile during the 17 year Pinochet dictatorship that ended in 1990. Garzon is now involved in both countries, and the cases have widened to embrace not just the killing of Spaniards but victims of other nationalities.
Since the case against Pinochet began at Madrid's National Court, the United States has agreed to provide the Spanish judges with documents related to human rights violations under the Pinochet regime.
The Madrid court has charged Pinochet and other members of the Chilean high command with crimes against humanity, including genocide and terrorism, involving the deaths of more than 4000 people.
Both extraterritorial investigations have drawn scorn from the civilian governments in Argentina and Chile, which have argued that the accused military officers have all benefited from amnesties and that no foreign judge can alter that.
Spain's conservative prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, has also told Buenos Aires and Santiago that he disapproves of the investigations, but that he cannot stop them.
He and other government officials have complained that the judge's activities are complicating their diplomatic relations and risk affecting Madrid's current strategy of expanding its business investments in Argentina and Chile.
But the judges have continued to press forward.
On Oct 14, learning that Pinochet had entered Britain for medical treatment, Garzon asked British judicial authorities to hold the former dictator until Spanish investigators could interrogate him about a series of crimes, particularly those committed under a so called Operation Condor in which Argentina and Chile cooperated in torturing and killing several hundred of their political opponents.
British authorities informed Garzon that Pinochet would be released from the hospital over the weekend and that they could not legally detain him.
Garzon then issued an arrest warrant against Pinochet, specifically linking him to the case of a Chilean citizen, Edgardo Henriquez, who in April 1976 was kidnapped and tortured in Argentina and soon after handed over to the Chilean secret police, then under Pinochet's command.
He has since been missing.
On Monday, Garzon will reportedly broaden the arrest warrant by adding the names of close to 80 additional victims, who were also kidnapped in Argentina and handed over to the Chilean secret police as part of Operation Condor.
A lawyer familiar with the proceedings said Garzon will also formalize his request that Britain extradite Pinochet to Spain.
However, before it can be transmitted to British authorities, the extradition request must first be accepted by Spain's Ministry of Justice and then approved by Aznar and his cabinet.
Aznar, who is known to favor turning down the request, has given no clear indication yet of the outcome.
Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet has been arrested by British police on a Spanish extradition warrant, despite protests from Chile that he is entitled to diplomatic immunity.
Two Spanish judges are seeking to question Pinochet about the slayings of an unspecified number of Spaniards in Chile between Sept 11, 1973, the date he seized power, and Dec 31, 1983.
No reason for the dates was given.
WASHINGTON The arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet shows the growing significance of international human rights law, suggesting that officials accused of atrocities have fewer places to hide these days, even if they are carrying diplomatic passports, legal scholars say.
Pinochet, who ruled Chile as a military dictator from 1973 to 1990, was granted amnesty in his homeland but was arrested on Friday in London at the request of Spanish authorities, who want him extradited to Spain.
A growing body of international law has in the last 10 years made it somewhat easier to reach across borders and apprehend suspects accused of torture, genocide and other "crimes against humanity."
A lawyer in Washington who represents victims of the Pinochet administration, Samuel Buffone, said, "What is really innovative and important here is that a Spanish court is looking at international acts of terrorism, systemic human rights abuses and genocide, and is asserting jurisdiction on that basis."
The Spanish authorities contend that Pinochet may have committed crimes against Spanish citizens in Chile.
They said the European Convention on Terrorism and other treaties required Britain to extradite Pinochet.
"The lesson here is that terrorists will have no safe haven and are the modern day equivalent of pirates," Buffone said.
"Anywhere they are found on the high seas they will be nabbed and prosecuted."
Thomas Buergenthal, a professor of international law at George Washington University here, expressed doubts that Pinochet was entitled to diplomatic immunity, even though he has a diplomatic passport.
"The fact that he wasn't accredited to Britain and was not in transit to a diplomatic post," Buergenthal said, "means that Britain doesn't have to give him diplomatic immunity, unless there was some prior arrangement to do so."
The case raises many complex legal questions.
For example, does Pinochet have any immunity because of his status as a former head of state or because of his current status as a "senator for life" in Chile?
Chile granted him amnesty, but are other countries required to honor that amnesty?
Could Spain try Pinochet for his actions in Chile?
Under the Chilean Constitution, adopted while he was in power, Pinochet is immune from prosecution there.
Professor Lori Damrosch, an expert on international law at Columbia University, said: "That doesn't carry any weight outside Chile.
It's not binding on any other country.
All these ex dictators must have an understanding that they are somewhat at risk when they leave their own countries."
The "personal inviolability" of diplomats is a venerable privilege that can be traced from the protection accorded to wartime emissaries in ancient Greece.
The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 says, "The purpose of such privileges and immunities is not to benefit individuals, but to ensure the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions."
Thus, legal scholars say, diplomatic immunity was not created to insulate people against prosecution for crimes against humanity or other atrocities.
In recent years courts have shown an increased willingness to try criminal and civil cases involving contentions that foreigners committed torture, genocide or war crimes.
Professor Michael Reisman of Yale said: "In the past a head of state would have been given broad immunity for acts committed while he was head of state.
But international law has moved steadily in the direction of assigning personal responsibility to such officials for grave violations of human rights or the law of war."
Spain's contention that it has the authority to interrogate and try Pinochet is similar to the United States' argument that it can try hijackers and terrorists for crimes committed against American citizens abroad.
Professor Jonathan Charney of the Vanderbilt Law School, editor of The American Journal of International Law, noted that Pinochet is accused of genocide, torture, and cruel and unusual punishment.
"These are considered universal crimes," he said.
Turkey's government collapsed Wednesday after losing a confidence vote in parliament over a corruption scandal that tainted the prime minister with allegations of mob ties.
The downfall of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and his nearly 17 month old government could push Turkey toward another crisis between Western oriented forces and pro Islamic supporters.
Turkey's secular military leadership warned a pro Islamic party Monday against dragging the army into politics, after its leader said the party has the backing of the army in forming a new government Recai Kutan, leader of Islamic Virtue Party, was quoted by the daily Milliyet on Saturday as saying that they were receiving signals that the army liked the party's new moderate tone.
"It is out of question for the armed forces to express whether it likes the tone of a political party or not," the general staff said in a statement.
"Everyone should refrain from making comments that would drag the armed forces into politics."
Kutan's Virtue Party is the successor of another Islamic party, Welfare, which was forced to step down from power by the military last year after it tried to increase the influence of Islam in society.
Welfare was banned earlier this year for anti secular activities.
A pro secular alliance replaced Welfare, but it collapsed last week over corruption charges,.
Traditionally, the job of forming a new government should go to Kutan, as his party has the largest number of seats in Parliament.
However, President Suleyman Demirel has not given any indication that he would designate him.
No party has the votes to govern alone.
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel planned to meet with Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit on Wednesday, stoking speculation that he'd ask the center left leader to form a new government.
Ecevit is said to have the support of Turkey's all powerful military and most analysts say he is the is the most viable replacement for Mesut Yilmaz, who was ousted in a no confidence vote last week over a mafia scandal.
Daily Milliyet said Demirel was likely to announce his choice before leaving Thursday for a one day trip to Romania.
By tradition, the leader of the largest party in parliament would get the nod.
But the largest party is Islamic Virtue, which is opposed by the military.
Last year, the military ousted Turkey's first Islamic led government.
Ecevit said he didn't want Virtue in the government and reiterated his proposal for a new secular coalition combining his Democratic Left party with Turkey's two center right parties.
The coalition would have a large majority in Parliament.
He said Wednesday that he opposes joining forces with Virtue because of "our commitment to secularism without concessions."
The veteran politician could act as the glue between Yilmaz and former premier Tansu Ciller, whose long standing political rivalry led to a government collapse in 1996.
Ecevit is said to have Yilmaz' support, but there are doubts about Mrs Ciller.
General elections are scheduled for April 18.
The head of Turkey's pro Islamic party said Thursday he would not insist on his rightful chance to lead Turkey's next government, heading off a confrontation with the military that would only deepen the nation's political crisis.
Parliament toppled Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's 17 month old government Wednesday in a no confidence vote over a mafia scandal, setting off a furious round of deal making among pro secular parties to piece together a new governing coalition.
"The no confidence vote has dragged Turkey into grave political chaos," Yilmaz declared.
By tradition, the job of establishing a new government should go to the Islamic Virtue Party since it is has the most seats in Parliament.
Few believe the all powerful, staunchly secular military would agree to that.
Although Turkey's people are overwhelmingly Muslim, its constitution mandates a strictly secular republic.
Within hours of the government's collapse, Virtue leader Recai Kutan met with President Suleyman Demirel, who is charged with picking a political leader who can command a governing majority in Parliament.
"We have told the president that we will not be insistent.
It's fine if we're in the new government.
It's fine if we're not," Kutan said.
Kutan said the next administration should be a caretaker government with the support of all parties, which would lead the country until the next national elections.
Turkey's generals pressured the nation's first Islamic led government out of office last year, after it came to power in a coalition with former Premier Tansu Ciller.
Mrs Ciller, head of the center right True Path Party and a key contender for power, was meeting with Demirel later Thursday.
Newspapers reported that Mrs Ciller was already in contact with Virtue in pursuit of a possible alliance.
The party denied the reports.
No party has a majority in parliament.
Analysts consider Mrs Ciller's True Path capable of fitting into any pro secular coalition in the political system, deeply divided by political rivalry.
Turkish politics have been torn in the 1990s between the choice of an Islamic led government or fragile, pro secular coalitions.
Even if the secular establishment succeeds in pushing aside Virtue, it would be difficult to put together a government without Mrs Ciller's backing.
Mrs Ciller, who commands 99 deputies in the 550 seat parliament, declared that she would act in a "constructive manner" either by being part of a coalition government or by extending outside support to a minority government.
One scenario suggests she may join forces with Yilmaz, long her rival.
Demirel said it would take four or five days before he completes consultations with party leaders and designates a premier.
Yilmaz, meanwhile, serves as caretaker premier.
Elections are scheduled for April 18.
Yilmaz has urged they be held earlier.
Parliament opened an investigation Thursday into the allegations that toppled Yilmaz that he had ties to Turkey's mafia and rigged the sale of a state bank.
ISTANBUL, Turkey The government of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, plagued since its inception 17 months ago by competing pressures from Islamic groups and the rigidly secular military, lost a vote of confidence in Parliament and fell Wednesday.
The 314 214 vote came after Yilmaz was implicated in a corruption scandal in which he is said to have helped gangsters buy a state owned bank.
He has denied all charges against him.
President Suleyman Demirel was expected to ask Yilmaz to stay on as prime minister until an interim government can be formed to take the country to an early election in April.
But with both Turkey's center right and center left parties divided by bitter rivalries, there seemed little prospect that a stable government could emerge from the election.
As a result, the military is likely to retain ultimate political power here.
Its commanders view themselves as the final bulwark against religious fundamentalism.
Critics, however, say their political role restricts the growth of democracy.
After two years of spectacular revelations about ties between criminals and successive Turkish governments, many Turks have become deeply cynical about politics.
Some believe that supporting the Islamic party is the best way to show their disgust with the political establishment.
Military commanders, however, may not allow the party to come to power even if it wins the election.
Yilmaz had sought to ease military backed restrictions on Islamic symbols, which he evidently believed were too strict and risked creating a political backlash.
He urged the military to stop insisting that female university students be forbidden to wear head scarves, but powerful generals quickly slapped him down.
Similar conflicts are likely to afflict the next government.
Demirel could name an interim prime minister within a few days.
According to press reports, leading candidates include Hikmet Cetin, the speaker of parliament, and former Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit.
During his term of office, Yilmaz managed to bring Turkey's inflation rate down from nearly 100 percent annually to about 77 percent.
Negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on an economic package for 1999 were to have begun Friday in New York, but were canceled Wednesday.
Gunes Taner, the Cabinet minister who was to have led Turkey's delegation, was implicated in the corruption scandal that brought down the government.
Human rights violations continued during Yilmaz's term, but apparently decreased steadily.
The human rights organization Amnesty International recently praised the steps he took to curb abuses.
Although Yilmaz was not able to push through major reforms to a political system that many Turks believe is encrusted and self centered, he will be remembered as the prime minister on whose watch the country's most wanted fugitive was captured.
The fugitive, Abdullah Ocalan, who leads a rebel army that has been fighting for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey, is in custody in Italy.
Although Yilmaz is perceived as pro Western, Turkey's relations with Europe deteriorated during his term.
After the European Union refused to name Turkey as a candidate for membership last year, Yilmaz reacted with a bitterness that alienated some European leaders.
Relations seemed to be improving until the capture of Ocalan last month.
When Italian leaders refused to extradite him for trial in Turkey, Yilmaz and other Turks accused Italy of embracing terrorism and threatened it with an economic boycott.
The Yilmaz government was fragile from the start, depending on the support of Deniz Baykal, a power broker who controls a faction in Parliament but declined to join the ruling coalition.
When Baykal withdrew his support several weeks ago, the government's fate was sealed.
Baykal acted after a series of charges that cast doubt on the government's integrity.
The charges stemmed from a complex scandal that has been spreading for the last two years.
It is centered around allegations that Turkish leaders have for years maintained ties to gangsters, using them to commit political murders and allowing them in return to smuggle drugs and weapons.
The charge that brought down the government Wednesday was based on testimony from an alleged Turkish crime boss who is being held in France.
He released audiotapes suggesting that Yilmaz and Taner helped one of his front men buy a bank from the government.
Yilmaz was installed in June 1997 after the military pressured Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, leader of the Islamic party, into resigning from office.
But his government was not able to agree on a strategy to counter rising Islamic influence here.
Polls suggest that if an election were held today, the Islamic party would finish strongly and perhaps even in first place, as it did in the last election in 1996.
Leaders of secular parties are expected to try to patch together an electoral alliance in the hope of heading off another victory by the Islamic party.
Yilmaz has said he will campaign on the strength of his government's economic successes and its role in the capture of Ocalan.
He is also anxious to clear his name.
"It will be the people who will very soon make the real judgment about our government," he said after Wednesday's vote.
The head of Turkey's pro Islamic party said Thursday he would not insist on his rightful chance to lead Turkey's next government, heading off a confrontation with the military that would only deepen the nation's political crisis.
Parliament toppled Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's 17 month old government Wednesday in a no confidence vote over a mafia scandal, setting off a furious round of deal making among pro secular parties to piece together a new governing coalition.

Mrs Ciller, head of the center right True Path Party and a key contender for power, said after meeting with Demirel later Thursday that she favored a strong, "broad based" coalition capable of tackling problems until the elections.
She would not elaborate.
Bulent Ecevit, the deputy premier in the outgoing government and leader of a center left party, declared himself in favor of a coalition between Yilmaz and Mrs Ciller.
He also indicated that he was willing to take part in that alliance.
Some reports have suggested a scenario in which Ecevit would head a three party alliance with Yilmaz and Mrs Ciller as the most likely option.
Turkey's president began trying to construct a new government Wednesday but the pieces do not neatly fit: pro Islamic forces pressing for power and their military backed, Western style opponents struggling to unite.
President Suleyman Demirel opened talks with party leaders just hours after the corruption battered coalition of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz lost a confidence vote in parliament.
It was Turkey's fourth government to collapse since 1995.
Demirel's meeting agenda clearly showed the potential difficulties ahead in a nation with a growing Islamic movement but a fiercely protected tradition of Western and secular principles.
One of his first meetings was with the leader of the largest bloc in parliament: the Islamic oriented Virtue Party, which seeks to instill greater Muslim codes and values in Turkey.
Traditionally, the job of forming a new government goes to the head of parliament's largest party.
But Demirel is under heavy pressure from the armed forces and secular political leaders to keep Virtue on the fringe.
Such rumblings from the military are taken seriously in Turkey, where the generals view themselves as guardians of the Western orientation.
The military has already helped push out one Islamic led government last year in what's been called a "soft coup" which cleared the way for Yilmaz's coalition.
And the generals have warned they could do it again.
Many business leaders fear a Virtue led government could be another setback to Turkey's attempts to draw closer to the European Union.
"It's not very likely that Virtue will get a shot forming a government," said Ilter Turan, a professor of political affairs at Bilgi University in Istanbul.
Turan speculated there is a "state of disarray and changing ideology" within Virtue, formed after its predecessor, Welfare, was outlawed by the government for allegedly undermining secular values.
Turan believes Virtue is in the process of trying to expand its base beyond the urban poor and strict Muslims.
Some Virtue backers now attend functions where alcohol is consumed and women in Western dress are among the party ranks.
"They are looking ahead to the next elections," said Turan.
Virtue officials say they don't want to wait until the next general elections in April.
A senior Virtue official, Nevzat Yalcintas, insisted the party "must lead" the next government.
On the other side, the Western style parties may seek to suspend their ceaseless feuds and unite in a coalition until elections.
A truce, however, is not so easy.
The most likely alliance, analysts say, could be led by Yilmaz and his longtime rival, former Prime Minster Tansu Ciller.
But their animosity runs deep.
Also, both Yilmaz's and Mrs Ciller's parties have been tainted by a widening corruption scandal that includes allegations of power abuse and links to organized crime.
The weight of the accusations brought down Yilmaz's nearly 17 month old coalition in the confidence vote in parliament, where opponents carried a convincing 314 214 margin.
Yilmaz has been accused of ties with organized crime and rigging the privatization of a state run bank by securing loans for a businessman linked to a mafia boss.
Yilmaz has denied any links to criminal gangs.
He is expected to remain in power in a caretaker role until a new government is formed.
The latest political reshuffling comes at a delicate time.
Turkey is waging an uphill fight for the extradition of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is seeking political asylum in Italy.
The diplomatic effort and public protests have strained Turkey's relationships with the European Union.
Nearly 37000 people have been killed in the 14 year battle between Turkish forces and Kurdish rebels seeking autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
One of Turkey's leading politicians warned Sunday that a political vacuum could cripple the domestic battle to keep Islamists at bay and in the fight abroad for the extradition of a Kurdish rebel leader.
In the midst of Turkey's uphill battle to get Italy to hand over a Kurdish rebel leader, the government collapsed Wednesday under the weight of corruption scandals.
No party has a majority to govern alone in the deeply divided parliament.
Acting Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit on Sunday called on Turkey's two center right parties, led by arch rivals acting Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and former Premier Tansu Ciller, to join him in a governing coalition.
"To deal with internal and foreign questions, Turkey needs, as soon as possible, a solid and healthy government," Bulent Ecevit told reporters.
Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left Party, warned that the Islamists might return to power if secular parties don't cooperate.
The military last year forced out the country's first Islamic led government.
The Islamic party, Virtue, is the largest party in parliament.
The military gets a chance Monday to have its say when it meets with President Suleyman Demirel and the acting cabinet.
It is up to Demirel to name a new premier.
Ecevit also said a political vacuum could hamper Turkey's campaign to get Italy to extradite Abdullah Ocalan.
Ocalan leads the autonomy seeking Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been at war with the Turkish army in the southeast for 14 years.
Italy is refusing to extradite Ocalan because he could face the death penalty.
Ocalan has asked for political asylum, which has enraged Turkey.
But Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema suggested Italy might instead expel the rebel leader, who tried to enter Italy using a false passport.
"Asylum has to be examined with great seriousness because Ocalan is accused of grave crimes and is accused of carrying out terrorist acts even in Germany," D'Alema told Italian state television on Saturday night.
Ocalan was arrested at the Rome airport on Nov 12 after arriving from Moscow.
Turkey and Germany both have warrants out on him.

Yugoslav war crimes tribunal investigators plan to return to Kosovo and resume their probe of alleged atrocities in the troubled province, a tribunal official said Wednesday.
Visas that were denied earlier by Yugoslav authorities have now been issued, Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt told a press briefing.
He did not give details on how many investigators will return or when.
Blewitt declined to speculate on the reason behind Belgrade's change of heart, nor could he confirm that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has explicitly agreed to total compliance with the U.N. court.
In a statement, Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United States, the tribunal's president, welcomed "in principle" the recent agreements aimed at averting military intervention.
But McDonald said she had not yet reviewed them to confirm that they contained "explicit provisions and mechanisms" aimed at ensuring Belgrade's compliance.
However, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, speaking on NBC's "Today" program, said cooperation with the tribunal was indeed part of the agreements with Milosevic.
"We had a big argument about the war crimes tribunal," Holbrooke said.
"It is embedded in our agreement that he said he will fully comply with the U.N. resolution and that calls for (compliance)."
Holbrooke said Milosevic had agreed to a doubling of war crimes tribunal staff in Belgrade and to letting them travel freely in Kosovo, where the tribunal wants to look into reports of Serb massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians.
The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour of Canada, was at the United Nations on Wednesday to clarify the scope and impact of the agreements as they relate to war crimes issues.
Blewitt said last week that Belgrade officials had suddenly begun claiming that the tribunal has no jurisdiction to conduct investigations in Kosovo.
The tribunal, set up by the United Nations in 1993 to prosecute crimes committed following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, has always maintained that it also has jurisdiction in the Kosovo conflict.
Until recently, tribunal staff were allowed to carry out investigations in the region, examining reports of atrocities by both sides in the Kosovo conflict.
"Our mandate is quite clear.
It is not subject to negotiations neither by President Milosevic nor Mr Holbrooke," Blewitt said emphatically.
McDonald repeatedly has chastised Belgrade for failing to surrender indicted war suspects at large in Yugoslavia, in particular the handover of three men accused of orchestrating the killings of 260 unarmed people after the fall of Vukovar in 1991.
"The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia continues to flout the law and the will of the international community" by refusing to turn over indicted suspects, she said in her statement.
The General Assembly voted Friday to select three judges to fill a new trial chamber of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, whose caseload could grow with atrocities committed during the Kosovo conflict.
Representatives of the 185 member assembly cast secret ballots, choosing among nine candidates nominated by their home countries.
The three will rule on cases concerning crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.
Their terms will end Nov 16, 2001.
None of the original nine candidates emerged from the first round of balloting with the 94 'yes' votes needed for a majority, meaning a second round was required.
Poland and Ecuador withdrew their candidates for the second round, narrowing the field down to seven.
The remaining candidates were Mohamed Bennouna of Morocco, David Anthony Hunt of Australia, Per Johan Viktor Lindholm of Finland, Hugo Anibal Llanos Mansilla of Chile, Patrick Lipton Robinson of Jamaica, Waldo Bandara Srinihal Wadugodapitiya of Sri Lanka and Peter H. Wilkitzki of Germany.
GOLUBOVAC, Yugoslavia A 42 year old man who says he is the lone survivor of a massacre in which 13 ethnic Albanians were summarily shot and killed in this village in Kosovo recalled Thursday how he was herded into a garden with other men and told to lie flat on the ground.
Heads to the fence, feet toward the house!
Serbian policemen barked, he recounted.
Then, the severely wounded man said as he recounted the tale from his mattress on the floor of his home Thursday, police kicked the prone men with their boots and beat them with the wooden handles of shovels.
"They kept yelling, 'Who among you is Kosovo Liberation Army?
If you tell us, we will release everyone else," the man recalled of the events of last Saturday.
Then, he said, the shooting started.
First, the man to his right was shot, then two men farther down the row.
And then the whole row from left to right, then down the row again, from right to left.
"After the two shots for each man, they kicked one, and he was alive." he said.
"They shot him again.
When they kicked me, I didn't move."
The survivor, the father of eight children, was advised by Western diplomats who interviewed him on Tuesday and by a researcher for Human Rights Watch who saw him Thursday not to give his name to a reporter for fear of jeopardizing his safety.
The diplomats and the researcher for the New York based rights organization said the man could suffer reprisals from Serbian policemen who are at checkpoints on the roads and in the hills around the village if he revealed his identity.
But they said that because of the clarity and first hand nature of the man's evidence, they consider him a key potential witness for a proceeding at the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
The killing of the men and the massacre of 18 members of an Albanian family on the same day in villages about four miles apart in the Drenica region of Kosovo, a province where guerrillas are fighting for independence from Serbia, prompted calls from Western leaders for war crimes investigations by The Hague tribunal.
Washington called on the government of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, to allow impartial forensic experts to visit the sites to determine what happened.
The Milosevic government has denounced the war crimes tribunal and consistently denied access to forensic experts, asserting that there was no need for them because no war crimes had occurred.
Two investigators from the war crimes tribunal who have been in Kosovo for a week were expected to see the survivor Thursday.
But the investigators who got into Kosovo, after long negotiations with the Yugoslavia government for their visas, left for Belgrade, the capital, Thursday without interviewing the survivor or inspecting the site where the Deliaj family was massacred.
A spokesman at The Hague, Jim Landale, said he had no information on why the investigators left before pursuing the two cases.
"We are confirming that we are investigating these incidents," he said.
The researcher for Human Rights Watch, Peter Bouckaert, who has experience in interviewing survivors of atrocities in Africa, said after listening to the man's account that the coherence of his story and his lack of exaggeration made him an important witness for the tribunal.
Significantly, he said, details of the story tallied with evidence in the garden of spent bullets from an automatic weapon and pools of blood along the fence.
The executive director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, said in New York Thursday that it was troubling that the tribunal had not seized the opportunity to listen to the survivor or inspect the two killing sites.
"This is not a historical inquiry," Roth said of the tribunal.
The survivor, who has a shock of black hair and full black mustache, has essentially been a captive in his house since he hobbled the half mile back home Saturday afternoon.
He is too frightened to go to the hospital even though his leg wound reaches to the bone and gangrene is starting to develop.
His left arm is also wounded from the second bullet.
The International Committee for the Red Cross visited him on Tuesday with some bandages and medicines but has not been back since, he said.
The man described the events leading up to the shootings as the climax of a Serbian attack on the village that began last Friday morning with shelling from across the hills.
Men, women and children fled to the forest and spent the night under the trees.
On Saturday morning, he said, everyone was ordered by Serbian forces to come out of the forest and gather in a field.
The women and children were separated from the men, and then the men were whittled down into a smaller group.
There were about "30 to 40 police" doing the sorting of the men, he said.
They wore the blue camouflage uniforms of the Serbian security police, and some had yellow insignia on their shoulders signifying rank, he said.
Some wore black bandannas around their foreheads.
Asked if there was one person in charge, he said: "I don't know.
They were all speaking."
Toward the end of the selection, one policeman was making the choices, he said.
The final group of men were ordered to walk about half a mile from the field to a dirt road at a spot just outside the garden of the house where the killings occurred.
They were told to kneel with their heads down to the ground, he said.
They were kept there about two hours, he said.
They were then forced to walk through the wide wooden gate of the garden and lie on their stomachs with their hands held behind their necks.
When the beating with the shovels started, the victims began to scream, he said.
Those who turned their faces to the policemen were beaten much more, he said.
"I was screaming and shouting, but I didn't turn my face, only once."
The man said that after a while, "somebody new came to the garden."
He presumed, he said, that it was the "new" policeman who did the firing.
A diplomat who interviewed him on Tuesday said he understood from the man's account that one or more policemen did the shooting.
"We were executed one by one," he said.
"Some were begging to be released.
Nobody tried to get up."
The clatter was that of an automatic weapon, he said.
Suddenly silence fell, he said.
He could hear the policemen leave the garden and then depart the village with a burst of machine gun fire.
A builder by trade, the man said his brother was one of the 13 who was shot to death.
His brother's body was brought home along the same route he had used to escape.
The survivor's face crumpled slightly when he was asked if he would testify at The Hague.
He was most afraid, he said, for the safety of his wife and children, who would most likely become targets of Serbian revenge.
The president of the U.N. war crimes tribunal angrily branded Yugoslavia a "rogue state" Thursday after Belgrade refused to allow investigators to probe alleged atrocities in Kosovo.
Authorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia confirmed they would not allow Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, and a team of investigators to carry out investigations in the troubled region.
"This conduct is a further example of the FRY's utter disregard for the norms of the international community," said tribunal president Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United States.
"Essentially, it has become a rogue state, one that holds the international rule of law in contempt," she said.
Arbour would not say what her next step would be.
She said her visa request was a matter of courtesy and that she has a legal right to carry out investigations throughout the former Yugoslavia.
Arbour had asked for visas for herself and 11 members of her staff so that they could conduct on site investigations and interview witnesses.
She vowed to continue investigating "using all means available to us," but did not elaborate.
Hundreds have been killed and hundreds of thousands made homeless in seven months of fighting between Serb forces and secessionist ethnic Albanian rebels in the southern Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
U.N. investigators want to check reports of atrocities on both sides.
Kirk McDonald said she would report the non issuance of visas to the Security Council, which set up the tribunal in 1993, and urge it to take "forceful" action to force Belgrade into line.
"In the final analysis, it is clear to me that I have an obligation, now that the prosecutor has reported non compliance, to bring this matter to the Security Council," Kirk McDonald said.
She said Belgrade's defiance of the tribunal amounted to "a challenge to the authority of the Security Council" which has ordered a tribunal investigation of alleged atrocities in Kosovo and told Yugoslav authorities to cooperate.
The visa holdup prompted Kirk McDonald, of Texas, to cancel a planned visit to Belgrade to speak to a conference on war crimes trials.
"This move by the Yugoslav government will have serious legal consequences," said Natasa Kandic, chairwoman of the Humanitarian Law Center organizing the conference.
"With it, the Yugoslav government acted directly contrary to the U.N. Security Council Resolution demanding free access to international investigators to Kosovo," she said.
"Relations between the tribunal and authorities here have now become strained in the extreme."
Yugoslavia must cooperate with a U.N. war crimes panel investigating allegations of atrocities in the rebellious Yugoslav province of Kosovo, a U.S. official said Saturday.
"In the U.N. Security Council, there is unanimous consent of all its members that investigators ,have full authority to do their job in Kosovo," said David Scheffer, the State Department's war crimes envoy at a panel discussion held in Belgrade.
President Slobodan Milosevic has defied international pressure to allow prosecutors from the Netherlands based tribunal to enter Kosovo, where hundreds have died in fighting that erupted in Februrary between separatist ethnic Albanians and Yugoslav forces.
Tribunal investigators have said they want to look into claims on atrocities on both sides.
Speaking at the round table discussion organized by the Belgrade based nongovernmental Humanitarian Law Center, Scheffer said there were reasons to believe that "serious violations of international law" were committed in Kosovo.
Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour and a team of investigators planned a weeklong mission in Kosovo to begin last Wednesday but were refused visas.
Arbour and Scheffer have threatened Yugoslavia with U.N. sanctions if the authorities continue to defy demands for unlimited access.
"Since February this year, between 600 and 1000 people died in Kosovo, many more were wounded," Scheffer said.
The tribunal maintains it has a legal right to carry out investigations throughout Yugoslavia.
The wars in the former Yugoslav republics prompted the Security Council to create the tribunal in 1993 with a mandate to prosecute breaches of international humanitarian law committed anywhere in the former Yugoslavia since 1991.
Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's two remaining republics.
Three Serbs were wounded after their cars were raked by gunfire from separatist ethnic Albanians, police said Wednesday.
The violence highlighted Kosovo's continuing potential for bloodshed despite last month's peace agreement.
Serb police at a checkpoint near Sipitula, about 15 kilometers (nine miles) west of Pristina, said Albanian guerrillas opened fire on two vehicles from the nearby Belacevac coal mine Tuesday evening.
They said an ensuing gunfight between police and the attackers lasted an hour.
Three miners in the two cars were injured and taken to Pristina hospital, according to police.
The cars, still sitting at the checkpoint Wednesday morning, had several bullet holes or marks in the windshields and chassis.
Villagers said Serb police began shooting at the village at about the same time police said the gunfight began.
The villagers said they fled and spent the night in nearby fields or homes of friends and relatives.
A few who returned Wednesday morning said police routinely attack the village and force them to flee.
In the Netherlands, the chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal locked horns with the Yugoslav government over the tribunal's jurisdiction in Kosovo.
Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour said in The Hague that her court has been given U.N. authority to investigate war crimes in any part of Yugoslavia.
She was responding to assertions by Yugoslav government officials that Kosovo is off limits to tribunal investigations.
Arbour said Yugoslav authorities still not have issued visas for a week long tribune mission to Belgrade and Kosovo, scheduled to start Friday.
Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's population, overwhelmingly favor independence.
The Oct 12 agreement, wrested from Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, suspended a nearly eight month crackdown in the province that left hundreds dead most of them Albanian civilians and hundreds of thousands others homeless.
While the guerrillas were not part of the agreement, they have grudgingly promised to respect it, if it does not compromise their goal of independence.
Alluding to the police threat to Albanian refugees before the attack, Kosovo's top ethnic Albanian leader said more needs to be done to ensure the safety of refugees going back home.
Ibrahim Rugova spoke Tuesday after venturing into the countryside for the first time in nine years.
"We saw huge destruction, but we met many people who have begun returning," he said.
"It's a beginning of the process to return.
But for a more massive return, more safety is needed."
Rugova saw charred and roofless homes during a tour of central Kosovo.
He accompanied U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who is trying to persuade the ethnic Albanians to give up their dream of Kosovo's independence from Serbia and settle for some form of self rule.
As the head of the ethnic Albanians' outlawed government in Kosovo, Rugova has remained almost exclusively in the capital Pristina since Serbia stripped the province's autonomy in 1989 and set up a huge police presence.
Sporadic violence by both sides continues, along with intimidation by Serb police intended to prevent ethnic Albanians from returning home in some areas.
"We have to give them a deeper sense of security as there is still fear for some people to get back home," Rugova said.
The Kosovo Information Center reflecting views of the Rugova camp reported Serb shelling of Petrovo, 30 kilometers (about 20 miles) southwest of Pristina on Wednesday.
Hill, who is trying to set up negotiations between Albanians and Serbs on a political agreement to set up a three year interim period of self rule, said a settlement is needed to generate more confidence and stability.
While Yugoslavia maintains it has complied with Western demands to reduce its forces in Kosovo to levels before the crackdown began last February, the Kosovo Liberation Army said Tuesday that more special police and soldiers must go.
On Wednesday, they announced they are holding two politicians from Rugova's party who went missing Oct 30 in Malisevo, southwest of Pristina.
The two, Jakup Kastrati and Cene Desku, were conducting an anti KLA campaign and "coaxed people to turn in their arms," said a KLA statement printed in the daily Koha Ditore.
Yugoslavia's state news agency, Tanjug, said two ethnic Albanians were sentenced to two and three year prison terms for being weapons carrying KLA members.
A delegation of U.N. war crimes investigators and prosecutors plans to visit Kosovo early next month, officials at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal said Wednesday.
The team, led by Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada and her deputy, Graham Blewitt of Australia, will investigate reports of massacres and other atrocities in the troubled Yugoslav province.
Gavin Ruxton, a senior legal adviser in Arbour's office, would give no details of the alleged war crimes the team would be investigating.
He confirmed that Arbour would leave for Yugoslavia on Nov 5, although he added that Yugoslav officials have not yet granted the team visas to visit the region.
Belgrade authorities recently began refusing to issue visas to tribunal investigators planning to visit the province, where Serb forces have been engaged in a seven month crackdown of secessionist ethnic Albanian rebels.
Three Serbs were wounded after their cars were raked by gunfire from separatist ethnic Albanians, police said Wednesday.

A former Bosnian Muslim prison guard charged with war crimes against Serb captives should get a milder sentence because he suffers from mental problems worsened by the war, his lawyer told a U.N. tribunal Monday.
The appeal came during the final phase of the months long trial of three Muslims and a Croat accused of atrocities at the Bosnian government run Celebici prison camp in 1992.
On trial are Hazim Delic, Celebici's deputy commander, Zdravko Mucic, the camp's former commander, Esad Landzo, a former Celebici guard, and Zejnil Delalic, who prosecutors claim had overall responsibility for the camp.
All four defendants have pleaded innocent.
If convicted, they face maximum life sentences.
Although the three judge panel at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal has not yet reached a verdict in the case, Monday's hearing allowed lawyers to introduce evidence that could help judges determine prison terms if the defendants are found guilty.
Landzo's lawyer, Cynthia McMurrey, was the first to present her case, using arguments ranging from Landzo's supposed rehabilitation to his fragile mental state during the war.
An expert witness testified that Landzo has a personality disorder which was compounded by the trauma of war and eventually led to diminished mental capacity, meaning he allegedly was unable to exercise his own free will to disobey orders during the war or to make decisions on his own.
In written arguments, Landzo's lawyers said his sentence if he is convicted should not be longer than five years.
They also based their arguments on his age, 25, the fact that he had no record before Celebici, and his voluntary surrender to the tribunal.
Like all guards at Celebici, Landzo acted under the orders of superiors in the camp, his lawyers said.
In a startling development Monday, Landzo even got some support from fellow war crimes suspect Goran Jelisic, who is awaiting trial on separate charges.
Jelisic, who calls himself the "Serb Adolf," took the stand and praised Landzo for keeping his cell clean, giving Jelisic some clothes in jail and playing volleyball with him.
"He's truly a social person, very communicative and a great joker," Jelisic said of Landzo.
Prosecutors have said that Serbs held at the central Bosnia camp were "murdered, tortured, raped and beaten."
A 49 page indictment alleges that inmates were beaten with steel cables and wooden and metal bars, burned with heated scissors, wrapped with fuses that were then lit, and kept in vats of water.
At least 14 died.
The Celebici trial, which began in March 1997, was expected to last only several months but has dragged on for 19 months, in part because the U.N. court has five other trials in progress.
Taking up sentencing arguments before a trial has ended is part of the tribunal's new efforts to streamline and speed up its work.
Lawyers for the other defendants, as well as prosecutors, were also scheduled to make sentencing arguments this week.
Handing the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal only its third conviction, a Bosnian Serb Thursday pleaded guilty to 14 murders.
Goran Jelisic, 30, faces a maximum life prison term for the killings.
Because he pleaded innocent to a genocide charge he will still face trial at the U.N. court.
Only then will he be officially convicted of the murders, presiding judge Claude Jorda said.
Unfortunately for residents of the United States, the Leonid storm on Nov 17 is expected to begin at 2:43 p.m. Eastern standard time and is likely to last for only an hour or so.
For the United States, therefore, the entire show will be during daylight hours and will be invisible, unless unusually bright bolides, or exploding fireballs, flash through the sky.
People in East Asia, however, will have ringside seats, and if skies are clear, they are likely to witness a great meteor display under ideal conditions: a dark, moonless night.
Although some forecasters predict that there will be an even better Leonid storm the next November actually, the second installment of this year's storm it will be visible only from Europe and North Africa.
But the storm next month may include some especially bright fireballs, said Joe Rao, a lecturer at New York's Hayden Planetarium, in an article in the November issue of Sky and Telescope magazine.
Some meteor enthusiasts and astronomers plan to travel to Asia this year and to Europe in 1999 to see the events.
The next chance of a really spectacular Leonid show anywhere on Earth will not come for another century.
Although the United States will not be the best vantage point for Leonid watching on Nov 17, people willing to get up a few hours before dawn on that day and the next may see more meteorites than they would on a normal night.
The closest approach the Earth will make to the center of the meteoroid swarm is 790500 miles more than three times the distance of the Moon from the Earth, but many dust fragments are likely to stray into collisions with the Earth.
Dr Donald K. Yeomans of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who tracks space objects of various kinds, cautioned that spectators in the United States should not expect too much.
"Some people think the Leonid storm this year will be as good as the one in 1966, which was the best one this century, but we think the 1998 shower will be more modest perhaps something between 200 and 5000 meteors per hour," Yeomans said.
In 1966, sky watchers clocked a rate of up to 100000 meteors an hour at the peak of the Leonid storm.
For meteor fans, Rao recommends watching the darkest part of the eastern sky from about 1 a.m. until dawn, on both Nov 17 and 18.
"Whatever you do, set that alarm clock," he advised.
"Not until 2098 or perhaps 2131 will hopes for a Leonid storm again be justified."
Periodically for at least the last 1000 years, a spectacular rain of meteors spawned by a passing comet has lighted up the sky, inspiring fear, wonder and admiration.
The meteor storm, which shot hundreds of thousands of blazing streaks across the heavens 33 years ago, is soon due to hit the Earth again, and this time space scientists are concerned about its effects.
The behavior of periodic meteor storms is hard to predict with certainty.
The meteor show forecast for Nov 17 or 18 might be spectacular or it might be a dud.
But whichever the case, every one of the 600 odd satellites orbiting the Earth spacecraft used for communications, military reconnaissance, peace keeping missions, climate and weather monitoring, astronomy, navigation and science will be hit by ultra high speed meteor dust.
The possibility of major damage to any of the satellites is regarded by experts as small, but cannot be discounted.
This storm of meteors, called Leonid meteors because they come from the direction of constellation Leo, will be the first to hit the Earth since 1966 when the world's space programs were in their infancy, and its effects on satellite systems are uncertain.
But the fear of possible damage has prompted many meetings by experts in recent months to discuss ways of minimizing hazards, and the operators of important satellites are taking no chances.
Whenever possible, satellites will be turned out of the way of the meteor storm for a few hours and placed in partial electronic hibernation.
Both military and commercial satellite operators said that even during maneuvering, major satellite functions would continue, including the transmission of voice, data and television traffic.
The only human beings who will be in space during the storm are the Russian crew of the Mir space laboratory, which will be unable to get out of the way.
American space officials said they expected the Russians to ride out the storm inside the Soyuz reentry vehicle, docked with Mir, enabling them to make a quick escape if Mir should be badly damaged.
In a normal day, dozens of meteors hit the Earth's atmosphere and burn up.
But besides this steady influx of meteors, there are also occasional showers and meteor storms associated with passing comets.
The Leonid meteors begin as dust or small chunks that break loose from Comet 55P/Tempel Tuttle whenever it approaches the Sun.
Once every 33 years, the ribbon like stream of dust and particles trailing the comet usually intersects the Earth's orbit around the Sun, just as the Earth is passing.
Comet 55P/Temple Tuttle, about two and a half miles in diameter, was discovered in 1865 by Ernst Tempel and Horace Tuttle, who calculated that its orbit around the Sun took a little over 33 years.
The historical record of the Leonid meteor storms goes back at least 1000 years.
The comet itself has never come close to hitting the Earth.
But particles that break loose from the comet are another matter.
In a report to Congress in May, Dr William H. Ailor of the Aerospace Corp. of El Segundo, Calif., a consultant to the Air Force on hazards to spacecraft, warned that this year's Leonid storm would pose the most serious meteoroid threat ever faced by the world's spacecraft.
He said, "Because of the very high speed of the particles they will be moving at speeds over 155000 miles an hour the storm poses an even greater and somewhat unknown threat."
(Astronomers designate objects moving earthward as "meteoroids."
When one of these hits the atmosphere and burns up it is called a "meteor."
If a meteor survives through the atmosphere and hits the ground it is called a "meteorite.")
Showers of Leonid meteors may produce hundreds or thousands of blazing meteors each hour.
Such storms pose no danger to life on the ground because most of the cometary particles are smaller than grains of sand and burn up high in the atmosphere.
Occasionally, larger chunks enter the atmosphere to produce bolides fireballs that leave luminous trails sometimes persisting for several minutes.
Sometimes bolides explode, producing dazzling flashes of light.
Dr Ahmet Ozkul of Intelsat, the largest operator of global communications satellites, estimates that the probability of any of the company's 20 satellites being damaged by a Leonid meteoroid in November will be less than 2 percent if no precautionary measures are taken.
But operators intend to do what they can.
One precaution will be to maneuver these two ton satellites (each valued at about $1.5 million) so as to present smaller targets for meteoroids.
"During the Leonid shower," he said, "most operators will slue their satellites around so that their big solar panels are turned edgewise to the stream of particles."
Ground controllers of some satellites plan to reduce the volume of commands from ground stations to avoid electronic garbling and erroneous commands that can be caused by the impact of dust particles.
Meteoroid damage to spacecraft has been rare since the mid 1960s when spacecraft became common.
An exception was a European communications satellite named Olympus, which was knocked out of operation in 1993, presumably by meteoroid impact.
(Another recent failure of a communications satellite occurred on May 19, when uncontrolled spinning of Galaxy IV shut down most pagers in the United States for nearly a day.
A spokesman for the Panamsat Corp. of Greenwich, Conn., the owner of the satellite, said it had been determined that its loss had resulted from internal failure, not from a hit by a meteoroid or debris.)
In 1993, astronauts conducting a repair mission on the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope found a hole about the size of a quarter in one of the instrument's dish antennas.
The hole might have been made by a meteoroid, although Dr John Campbell of the Space Telescope Science Institute, which operates the satellite, said the damage was more likely to have been from the impact of a piece of man made debris from some space mission.
Space experts consider "sand blasting" by micrometeoroid to be a more likely threat than penetrating hits.
Without actually piercing vital parts of spacecraft, the hail of microscopic particles is expected to cause wear and tear during the few hours of the storm, that would be equivalent to the wear and tear of up to three years of normal operation without meteoroid storms.
Another hazard is electrical.
A microscopic particle hitting the skin of a spacecraft at 44 miles per second is vaporized into plasma an ultra hot, electrically charged gas.
During the plasma's ephemeral existence it may conduct its electrostatic charge to the spacecraft, causing arcing, short circuits and damage to computer chips and circuits.
Sand blasting by comet dust can also damage mirrors, lenses and the optical components used by spy satellites, weather sensors and orbiting astronomical instruments, including the Hubble Space Telescope.
"Before, during and after the Leonid storm," Campbell said, "we intend to slue the Hubble telescope around so that its metal back faces the meteoroids, shielding its optics from damage."
For 10 hours the telescope will be pointed opposite the direction from which the meteors will be coming, he said.
Intelsat will also slue its communications satellites, so that their big solar panels are turned edgewise to the meteoroid stream for about three hours, thereby presenting the smallest possible targets, Ozkul said.
The Intelsat satellites, which carry digital, voice and television signals, operate 22300 miles high in what are known as geosynchronous orbits, in which each satellite remains permanently over the same spot on the Earth's surface.
Chances of serious damage to Mir are regarded as very small, American experts said, noting that even the space shuttle has been knicked by debris from time to time with no serious effects.
(For example, the shuttle Atlantis was hit both by a meteoroid fragment and a piece of debris in September last year.)
In any case, the big Mir station will not be able to maneuver out of the way.
To be on the safe side, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has delayed the launching of the space shuttle until after the Leonid shower.
Some satellites in low earth orbits can actually hide from meteoroid storms, Ozkul said.
Some carry enough fuel that they can maneuver into orbits in which the Earth will shield them for a short time from the peak of the meteoroid storm.
"Hiding from the storm would be a judgment call," he said, "because you would use up a lot of precious maneuvering fuel, but it can be done in an emergency," Ozkul said.
"We couldn't do it with our geosynchronous satellites, which are 22300 miles up, but some near earth satellites could hide behind the Earth long enough to reduce the risk."
The Aerospace Corp. regards the Leonid shower as a test, from which the world's satellite owners and users will gain useful knowledge.
Some satellites, including the galaxy of Air Force satellites serving the Global Positioning System of navigation, can detect and report meteoroid hits on themselves.
Such information may lead to improved meteoroid protection for future space stations, Ailor said.
Of the roughly 600 active satellites in orbit, half are American, and about half of these are military.
Only "a handful" of these satellites will be reoriented, said Maj. Perry L. Nouis of the Air Force, spokesman for the United States Space Command.
Power will be temporarily reduced for some satellite systems to lessen the chance of electrical problems caused by meteoric dust, he said.
On the positive side, Nouis said, "This year's Leonid storm will give us a lot of data that may be useful for protecting satellites against future showers."
Stargazers in Asia sought high ground and clear skies Tuesday to view the most spectacular celestial fireworks in 33 years, after enjoying a low key preview Monday night.
The Leonids meteor shower was expected to blaze forth in its entire glory over Asia and the Pacific after midnight and into early Wednesday, regaling millions with a heavenly display of falling stars too numerous to wish upon.
Sky watchers will get a final chance at the big show Wednesday night, after which sporadic showers may be visible for several days.
The front row seats were expected to be wherever the sky was darkest and clearest from the Mongolian steppes to the mountains of northern Thailand to U.S. research planes breaking through cloud cover over Okinawa, Japan.
For millions of others those befogged by weather or living in North America, when the spectacle was to reach its peak at midday, the worst time for viewing the Internet was the place to be.
In northern Thailand, hotels, camp grounds and airlines were booked solid with people expected to head to Doi Inthanon, the Southeast Asian country's highest peak at 2565 meters (8464 feet).
For those who went up Monday night, the streaking star fall came into view at about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday (1830 GMT Monday) to a chorus of "oohs" and "aahs," and 33 year old Thamarong Kudpong made his wish: "I already have a daughter.
Now, I would like a son."
Many in Japan were wishing Tuesday for the weather to clear.
The government called on public offices and private businesses in the cities to turn off their lights to enhance viewing possibilities.
In Thailand, police anticipated a rush out of Bangkok, the smog ceilinged capital, by people looking for a clearer view.
Alternative traffic routes were posted to avoid worsening evening rush hour.
Officials in the capital ordered all public parks closed Tuesday night for fear that hordes of stargazers would not be safe in the dark, said a local television station.
At least one member of the Thai royal family, Princess Sirindhorn, was traveling to a rural eastern province to observe the show, ITV also reported.
The celestial fireworks are actually the long tail of the Comet Tempel Tuttle.
The shower is nicknamed Leonids because ancient observers thought the meteors came from the constellation Leo.
It occurs every November, usually with little fanfare.
But every 33 years, the comet speeds through the inner solar system and sheds swarms of particles as it nears the sun.
In 1966, the Leonids display peaked at 150000 meteors per hour.
Earth plows straight through the comet's wake as it traces its own orbit.
The shower of "falling stars" is actually the glowing contrails of comet dust, or meteoroids.
Many of the world's 600 plus satellites have been maneuvered to reduce the possibility of damage from the speeding grit, which can poke holes in solar panels, pit lenses, blast away mirror coatings or cause damaging electromagnetic pulses.
Russian space authorities said the crew of the Mir space stations was prepared for a too close encounter and would enter the Soyuz escape capsule when the shower is at its peak.
"It is better to be on the safe side," Deputy Mission Control chief Viktor Blagov was quoted as saying by the ITAR Tass news agency.
In Romania, the Bucharest daily Evenimentul Zilei said in a front page headline: "Romanians, Stay Inside!
Leonide, the Toughest Meteor Rain."
Satellite operators reported no immediate problems Tuesday as the Earth passed through the tail of a comet that peppered the atmosphere with tiny bits of space junk zipping along at 155000 mph (250000 kph).
While people around the world watched the beginning of the best meteor storm light show in three decades, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration and private satellite companies rotated their high tech machinery to face away from the approaching debris.
The Hubble telescope was turned away from the storm to protect lens surfaces.
And the crew of Russia's Mir space station planned to wait out the worst of the storm in their emergency escape vehicle.
Most military satellites are built to withstand attack and so have better protection from the tiny meteors.
NASA planned to reposition six of its 22 satellites to present a smaller target.
Others were to be powered down for the worst part of the storm.
The particles from the tail of Comet Tempel Tuttle move at 43 miles (69 kilometers) per second.
Even a small grain can have the destructive force of a .22 caliber bullet shot at one of the world's 600 plus satellites, experts say.
The debris particles, most no bigger than a grain of sand, can bore holes in solar panels, damage lenses, blast away mirror coatings or cause harmful electrical charges.
That created a threat to communications, satellite TV broadcasts and military spying.
Aerospace Corp. had no reports of trouble as of early this morning, said company spokesman Greg Hughes, who was on call overnight in case of emergency.
An office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, that was to orchestrate troubleshooting efforts remained unstaffed during the night.
The likelihood of a direct hit was small.
"The chances of any one satellite getting smacked by a particle is probably less than one in one thousand, but on the other hand, some of these satellites are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, so you do take whatever precautions you can," said Don Yeomans, a senior research scientist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
The much anticipated storm of Leonid meteors swept over Earth on Tuesday, a bit ahead of schedule, leaving many sky watchers disappointed but others dazzled by fireballs as bright as the full moon.
The Leonids, so named because they appear to come from the constellation Leo, flash through the sky in large numbers every year about this date, but once in about every 33 years the swarm is often so dense that tens or hundreds of meteors are seen each hour.
The last such storm was in 1966, and a good show was expected this year.
Another good Leonid display might occur a year from now, astronomers have forecast.
The Leonid meteors, most of them smaller than grains of sand, are fragments knocked loose from Comet 55P/Temple Tuttle each time it makes a close approach to the Sun every 33 years.
Reports from regions that were in nighttime darkness Tuesday during the peak of the meteor storm suggested wide variations in the storm's apparent intensity.
But nowhere did the reported rate of meteor sightings greatly exceed 2000 per hour barely one tenth the rate at which meteors hit the atmosphere during the great 1966 Leonid storm.
There were no immediate reports of damage to any of the roughly 600 satellites orbiting the Earth that are used for communications, military surveillance, climate and weather monitoring, astronomy and navigation.
The odds of any given satellite being hit by a meteoroid were calculated as about one in a thousand a small risk but one that caused some concern because of the high value of many satellites.
Satellite experts said that some damage might take days to detect, but that satellites generally seemed to have escaped disabling harm.
Forecasts that the Leonids would put on their best show over Japan and China were only partly realized, according to news agency reports, people in parts of Thailand saw many bright meteor trails, while the view from Tokyo was disappointing.
The meteor display was unexpectedly good over southern Europe, and came several hours earlier than predicted.
The Harvard Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., which is a worldwide clearinghouse for reports from astronomers, said that observers at La Palma in the Canary Islands saw about 2000 meteors per hour at the peak.
But observers in Portugal counted only a few more than 300 per hour.
Dr Brian Marsden of the astrophysical observatory said the Leonid display included an unusually high proportion of fireballs, a few of which reached the brightness of the full moon during their speedy crossing of the sky.
Russia's Interfax news agency reported that a meteorite weighing several ounces was seen to land during the Leonid storm in front of a car in the city of Rustavi in Georgia.
But Marsden expressed doubt that the meteorite was part of the storm.
"We sometimes see sporadic meteorites during these storms that are not related to the main body of meteoroids," he said.
"This sounds like one."
Only very rarely is a meteoroid large enough and dense enough to survive its fiery trip through the atmosphere and reach the ground.
Old records suggest, however, that as many as half a dozen people (and one dog) may have been killed by meteors during the course of human history.
But there is ample geological evidence that huge meteoroids have hit the Earth in the distant past, and probably will again.
NATIONAL FORECAST Low pressure will move northeast over the northern Great Lakes Thursday.
A conveyor belt of cold, moist air to the northwest of the low's track will cause moderate to heavy snow over northern Minnesota to persist into the afternoon.
An additional few inches of snow will accumulate after sunrise, bringing storm totals to nearly a foot in some places.
Patchy light snow and flurries will linger over the eastern Dakotas and the rest of Minnesota.
A cold front extending south from the low will cross the Ohio and middle Mississippi valleys.
Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms will precede the front.
Given that moist air from the Gulf of Mexico is limited, heavy rain is unlikely and rainfall totals will generally remain below one half inch.
Milder air surging north ahead of the front will encounter stubborn chilly air in the northern Appalachians.
As the warm air is forced to rise above the cooler air near the ground, clouds and pockets of drizzle will develop over the Northeastern states, aided by damp air penetrating inland from the Atlantic.
Showers will develop Thursday night as the front approaches.
Although a rogue shower is possible, most of the Southeast will remain dry through Thursday evening.
Florida will be partly sunny and very warm, with near record warmth in southern sections.
A stream of mild, moist air from the Pacific Ocean will direct an area of rain onto the Northwest coast with snow falling in the Cascades.
Meanwhile, high pressure over the Great Basin will sponsor sunny, tranquil conditions from the central Rockies to southern California.
Focus: Eye Protection For three hours on Tuesday, no images were received from the satellite that normally provides constant coverage for most of North America and the Atlantic.
Technicians had repositioned the mirror that is used to make images of the earth so that the fusillade of tiny particles from the Leonid meteor shower would be less likely to damage the eye in the sky.
There are five geostationary satellites spaced approximately 70 degrees of longitude apart that are essential tools for monitoring global weather changes.
All of these satellites came through Tuesday's meteor shower unscathed.
By the time the earth collides with a dense swarm of meteoroids Tuesday night to unleash what may be the heaviest meteor bombardment since 1966, many orbiting satellites will have maneuvered into positions facing away from the storm to avoid damage.
But scores of instruments on the ground and aboard airplanes will be aimed right at the blazing trails left by the meteors, gathering information about these visitors from space and what they do to the upper atmosphere as they burn up.
Astrophysicists, atmospheric scientists and others have been readying their experiments for a year or more in preparation for Tuesday night's expected Leonid Meteor storm, so named because the meteors appear to be coming from the direction of the constellation Leo.
The meteors are fragments, most of them microscopic in size, of Comet 55P/Tempel Tuttle.
Although the earth encounters Leonid meteors every year on about this date, only once in approximately every 33 years does the earth intersect the swarm at a crowded point in the wake of the comet after the comet has made its closest approach to the sun.
This year scientists expect many Leonid meteors to be made of fresh material knocked loose from the comet, making them better indicators of the comet's composition than fragments that have aged.
In 1966 the Leonids put on a spectacular show, with tens of thousands of meteors blazing through the sky each hour.
Many astronomers believe there is a good chance that this year's display will be just as spectacular, at least for viewers in East Asia, which will be in nighttime darkness during the few hours when the swarm is at its peak.
Other experts, including Dr Donald K. Yeomans of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., guess that the storm will be much more modest, producing only 200 to 5000 meteors per hour.
In any case, meteor experts from several countries have converged on Asia to measure and study the Leonids as they hit the atmosphere at speeds of about 45 miles per second.
Among them are teams of specialists who will fly aboard two airplanes a prop jet Electra owned by the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., and an Air Force KC 135 jet.
Both are modified with upward looking windows permitting photography, spectroscopy, laser probes and other types of observation.
For about eight hours starting before midnight in East Asia, the two airplanes, temporarily based in Okinawa, will fly in formation with each other.
The NCAR Electra, the slower of the two, will fly back and forth along a straight track at about 25000 feet, while the Air Force KC 135, flying at about 40000 feet, will fly an elliptical course around the Electra's path.
Instruments aboard both planes, a known distance apart, will measure the angles between their respective views of a given meteor trail, and triangulation will allow them to calculate the altitude of the trail.
The scientists are not worried about being hit by meteors, most of which burn up in the mesosphere far above them, 50 to 65 miles high.
Most of the fragments are smaller than grains of sand, and only very rarely is a meteor large enough and dense enough to survive its white hot trip through the air all the way to the ground.
The lead experiment on the Electra, conducted by Dr Chester S. Gardner and his team from the University of Illinois, will seek to measure the amount of iron dumped into the atmosphere by meteors, and to measure the temperatures of meteor trails.
The group has developed a new type of lidar (which stands for "light detection and ranging") for the experiment.
A lidar instrument, similar in principle to a radar except that it uses light instead of radio waves, sends a powerful laser beam directly upward, where it excites target atoms in the thin atmosphere sensitive to the laser's wavelength.
They emit light, and a telescope, aimed at exactly the spot where atoms excited by the laser are glowing measures and analyzes the light.
Gardner's group has built a pair of lidars based on crystals of alexandrite, a mineral that can lase at any of a range of wavelengths, depending on how it is "seeded" by a small diode laser of the desired wavelength.
Using a complex optical system, the University of Illinois group has tuned its lidars to two of the wavelengths of ionized iron the form that iron assumes at very high temperatures.
By sending up beams of ultraviolet light at 372 and 374 nanometers, the group expects to excite iron ions to fluoresce in visible light that can be detected and measured by the two telescopes aboard the airplane.
The ratio of fluorescence triggered by the two laser beams will reveal the temperature of the high altitude iron atoms and therefore the meteor trail.
This laser thermometer is expected to improve understanding of the chemistry of the upper atmosphere and the effects of meteors on it.
"We can't aim the lidars in the plane.
They always point straight up," Gardner said in an interview, "so we have to wait for a meteor trail to pass directly overhead through out beam.
On an ordinary night we have to wait five hours or more for a single trail, but during this storm we hope the intervals between overhead meteors will be much shorter and give us much more information."
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is in charge of the airborne study, which is also supported by the National Science Foundation and the Air Force.
One of the objects of the program is to determine how a meteor's mass is related to its brightness.
In another part of the program, spectrometers will analyze light from meteor trails (which often persist for several seconds) in terms of their chemical composition.
Meteoroids are broadly classed either as silicates (especially olivine, pyroxene and plagioclase) or metallic meteorites made mostly of iron and nickel, but there are many variations.
One of the experiments aboard the Electra is a wide angle camera that can record images of the glow emitted by excited sodium atoms in the atmosphere.
The sodium content of the atmosphere is expected to be significantly increased by the arrival of meteors, and sodium at high altitude reacts with ozone.
Scientists hope to learn whether meteor storms degrade the ozone shield protecting life on earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.
Meanwhile, the operators of scores of scientific, military and commercial satellites have prepared the best they can for the sand blasting the meteor storm may produce.
Solar panels have been turned edgewise to present small targets to meteoroids, and some electrical systems have been shut down to minimize the chances of destructive short circuits triggered by impacts.
A satellite regarded as particularly endangered by the Leonids is the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) designed and built by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory to study charged particles coming from the sun and beyond the solar system.
Launched last year, ACE is now one million miles from the earth in the direction of the sun a very vulnerable position close to the center of the comet's wake.
NASA is reorienting the spacecraft to present a small target, but Dr Mary Chiu, ACE's program manager, said "we're crossing our fingers in hopes of an uneventful day on the 17th."
Whether they stood on the tallest mountain in Thailand or the desert in California, tens of thousands of people were searching the skies for a glimpse of the biggest meteor shower in decades.
Clouds interfered with the view from many sites, but many stargazers were rewarded with a spectacular view of meteors streaking through the skies in blazes of red and white as the Leonid meteor shower reached its climax early Wednesday in Asia.
The shower, which peaks every 33 years, is caused by the Earth's passage through the long tail of the Comet Tempel Tuttle.
The storm, which began Monday, got its name because it appears to come from the direction of the constellation Leo.
The biggest crowds gathered in Asia, which was best positioned for viewing the climax, but the spectacle was seen throughout the globe weather permitting.
In Tokyo and many other Asian cities, public offices and private businesses turned off their lights to enhance viewing.
Though the night remained bright in the Tokyo area, meteors could be seen streaking across the skies every two or three minutes at the peak of the storm.
"I only wish I could think up wishes faster," said Ikue Oe, a housewife watching the storm with her husband in the Tokyo suburb of Yokohama.
Tens of thousands of tourists swarmed to Doi Inthanon, Thailand's highest peak at 2565 meters (8464 feet), and Doi Suthep, another mountain with a famed Buddhist temple on top.
People shrieked and squealed with delight as they glimpsed the night's first shooting star at almost exactly 1 a.m. Wednesday (1800 GMT Tuesday).
But their enjoyment was tempered by the sight of clouds moving in.
Officials said 10000 people had passed through the national park's gates by 7:30 p.m. Tuesday (1230 GMT), seven hours before the anticipated peak of the promised celestial spectacle.
People huddled in blankets drove in, paid the 20 baht (55 U.S. cents) entrance fee and continued up the mountain, scouting for suitable viewing spots and turning the park into a tent city.
The mountain's actual peak was reserved for dignitaries and scientists.
The crowds that gathered at sites in the Mojave Desert in California were smaller but no less enthusiastic.
The desert's campgrounds, normally empty on November weeknights, were jammed with dozens of stargazers in the early morning hours, many peering through telescopes and whooping and hollering with each dazzling display from the Leonid meteor shower.
Sandra Macika, 36, of San Jose saw about 30 meteors as she watched the skies from Mercy Hot Springs, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Los Banos.
"I could see in front of me big streaks of light falling on the highway," she said.
Most Australians who rose early Wednesday were disappointed to find storm clouds blocking the rare display of celestial fireworks.
Sydney Observatory astronomy curator Nick Lomb said that while some astronomers at Parkes Observatory, in northwestern New South Wales, had seen fireballs through the clouds, it was not the meteor storm they had hoped for.
The view apparently was clearer in Norway, where rescuers were swamped with calls from people who spotted what they thought were red distress flares fired from ships in trouble off the southern coast.
"The meteors really changed color, and sometimes they were bright red, so I can understand that people associated them with distress rockets," said rescue leader Ben Vikoeren.
Chicken Little would love this one.
The Earth is hurtling into the path of a comet called Temple Tuttle.
On Tuesday, the Earth will enter Temple Tuttle's debris strewn backwash and will then, according to many scientists, witness the most intense meteor shower in more than three decades.
The scientists who track Temple Tuttle do not even call it a shower, they call it a meteor storm.
(While visible in Asia, the storm will be obscured by the sun in North America during its peak hours.)
And in the midst of the storm, among millions of particles moving at roughly 160000 miles an hour, will be 600 or so man made satellites, which most people in the industrialized world have come to rely on, wittingly or not, for entertainment, communication and spying on one another.
"This is the first time in the life of our communications oriented world that we have faced an environmental threat of this scope," said Ian Rowe, chief executive of Crestech, a nonprofit group based in Toronto that will track the storm for the Canadian and U.S. governments.
Rowe said the only previous instance of a satellite's being disabled by meteors occurred in 1993 during a shower about one 3000th the density of the storm predicted for Tuesday.
American consumers felt the impact of a single satellite's malfunctioning in May, when the failure of Galaxy IV disrupted pager service in much of the nation.
If Tuesday's storm seriously damages any satellites, the effects could be even more daunting.
The spy satellites that are peering down at Saddam Hussein could lose their ability to spot movements of his troops.
Television channels could become static.
Those relying on satellite navigation could become lost.
Corporate networks could shut down.
Even the international telephone system, which mostly relies on undersea cables, could be crippled.
ATandT Corp. says there are at least 14 countries, mostly in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, that can be reached by telephone only by satellite.
The satellite industry, however, and some of the companies that rely on it, have a different reaction: no big deal.
"We don't think this will be much of an issue," said Daniel Marcus, a spokesman for Panamsat, the world's largest private satellite company, which is controlled by the Hughes Electronics unit of General Motors Corp. "It should be a nonevent."
And Stephen Stott, director for satellite engineering at Intelsat, the international satellite consortium, said, "Most of the industry is of the opinion that we do not expect any major problems."
After all, the odds say that the meteors known as the Leonids because they seem to come from the direction of the constellation Leo have about as much chance of seriously damaging the world's satellites as Mark McGwire does of smashing the windshield of the sole car in an otherwise empty parking lot with a blast from inside a Major League ballpark.
In addition to a physical threat, though, the Leonids, generally smaller than grains of sand, also pose the risk of creating strong electrical charges on satellites, potentially damaging sensitive components.
So while the big satellite companies play down the threat, they are still taking steps to protect their property.
Deploying a commercial communications satellite can cost around $250 million.
The companies plan to turn solar arrays so that their edges face the oncoming meteors, presenting a smaller target.
They plan to shut down some systems, to keep operations simple.
But Alastair Hamilton, who is responsible for distributing Cable News Network as Turner Broadcasting System's senior vice president for worldwide distribution technology, said some viewers still might lose their signal for a few minutes Tuesday as satellites recover from short circuits.
He added, however, that he could not get too agitated because there is so little he can do.
"At the end of the day, the satellites are up there and there is no way to hide them," he said.
"So we're going to really see what happens.
And the prevailing opinion is that this is not really something that we should be losing a huge amount of sleep over."
That is not quite how Col Mike Kelly is handling the situation.
That is because he works for the owner of about a quarter of the world's satellites: the U.S. government.
As deputy commander of the 50th Operations Group at Schriever Air Force Base near Colorado Springs, Colo., Kelly helps run about 60 Air Force satellites worth about $40 billion.
Kelly's charges provide navigation services, communications for officials including the president, and help in detecting missile launches.
While Marcus of Panamsat and Gregory Clark, president of Loral Space Communications, another big private satellite company, said they expected no impact on their services, Kelly is more pessimistic.
"I think it's very unlikely that we'll lose a spacecraft on the 17th," he said.
He added, however, "I think it's probable that we'll see some electrical problems that we'll have to recover."
He said that could take anywhere from a few minutes to several days.
(Kelly's group does not manage any of the optical spy satellites, he said.
Those are generally handled by the ultra secretive National Reconnaissance Office, which refused to comment.)
In contrast to the private satellite companies, however, the Air Force, according to Kelly, has decided not to change its normal operating procedures substantially, except to be especially watchful.
"We don't know ahead of time how serious it will be," Kelly said.
"If it turns out to be a nothingburger, I'll be one of the happiest people in Colorado."
And Ken Kirkhart will be one of the happiest people in Virginia.
Kirkhart is vice president for production at USA Today, which uses 33 satellite linked printing plants in the United States.
Each plant is linked to two satellites, Kirkhart said, but he is still nervous.
"It's a crapshoot, you just don't know," he said.
"There's nothing more you can do.
There's not time.
The only thing you could do to put yourself in a risk free situation is to put in a terrestrial system, and to do that to 33 sites, well, you've dealt with the phone companies."
The New York Times, which uses a satellite to communicate with eight of its 13 printing plants, has a backup plan to use terrestrial, or ground based, communications.
But rather than link directly to all eight sites in the event of a satellite problem, The Times would link only to some of them and fly film for the printing plates to the rest, according to Catherine Mathis, director for investor relations for New York Times Co.
She added that the printing plants could also tune in to a backup satellite.
Dow Jones and Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, was one of the few companies to disclose the potential problems posed by the storm in a filing with federal regulators, though a Dow Jones spokesman refused to discuss his company's contingency plans.
The Iridium satellite telephone venture, which is controlled by Motorola Inc., also mentioned the Leonids in a recent federal filing, though the company declined to discuss the subject.
"There is no relevant experience we can use to base an assessment of the damage, if any, that the storm might cause to low earth orbit satellites," the Iridium filing said, referring to the sort of satellites it uses.
"But such damage could be significant."
But whether the real probability of a satellite's being hit is one in 5000, as some industry experts predict, or one in 100, as Rowe estimates, perhaps the only thing that could provide true peace of mind would be no meteor storm at all.
"In theory, you can walk across a freeway in the middle of the night and get away with it," he said, by way of analogy.
"But you might get K.O.'d by a truck."
Chicken Little would love this one.

"We don't know ahead of time how serious it will be," Kelly said.
"If it turns out to be a nothingburger, I'll be one of the happiest people in Colorado."
And Ken Kirkhart will be one of the happiest people in Virginia.
Kirkhart is vice president for production at USA Today, which uses 33 satellite linked printing plants in the United States.
Each plant is linked to two satellites, Kirkhart said, but he is still nervous.
"It's a crapshoot, you just don't know," he said.
"There's nothing more you can do.
There's not time.
The only thing you could do to put yourself in a risk free situation is to put in a terrestrial system, and to do that to 33 sites, well, you've dealt with the phone companies."
The New York Times, which uses a satellite to communicate with eight of its 13 printing plants, has a backup plan to use terrestrial, or ground based, communications.
But rather than link directly to all eight sites in the event of a satellite problem, The Times would link only to some of them and fly film for the printing plates to the rest, according to Catherine Mathis, director for investor relations for New York Times Co.
She added that the printing plants could also tune in to a backup satellite.
Dow Jones and Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, was one of the few companies to disclose the potential problems posed by the storm in a filing with federal regulators, though a Dow Jones spokesman refused to discuss his company's contingency plans.
The Iridium satellite telephone venture, which is controlled by Motorola Inc., also mentioned the Leonids in a recent federal filing, though the company declined to discuss the subject.
"There is no relevant experience we can use to base an assessment of the damage, if any, that the storm might cause to low earth orbit satellites," the Iridium filing said, referring to the sort of satellites it uses.
"But such damage could be significant."
But whether the real probability of a satellite's being hit is one in 5000, as some industry experts predict, or one in 100, as Rowe estimates, perhaps the only thing that could provide true peace of mind would be no meteor storm at all.
"In theory, you can walk across a freeway in the middle of the night and get away with it," he said, by way of analogy.
"But you might get K.O.'d by a truck."
Typhoon Babs brought torrential rains and landslides to Taiwan and lashed Hong Kong with strong winds Sunday after killing more than 150 people in the Philippines and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.
The Central Weather Bureau said that at 3 p.m. (0700 GMT), the typhoon was centered 120 kilometers (72 miles) southwest of Pratas Island in the South China Sea.
Packing sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph), Babs was moving northwest at 9 kph (5.4 mph) toward south China.
Its outer fringes brought torrential rains to the whole island of Taiwan, with Hualien and several other eastern towns recording more than 500 millimeters (20 inches) of rain in 24 hours, weathermen said.
Authorities evacuated hundreds of people from their homes near flooded rivers.
In Taipei, the main Keelung River has swelled its banks.
One third of Hsichih town was flooded in waist high water, and much of nearby Wutu was also flooded.
Rescuers used rubber boats and trucks to evacuate residents from apartment blocks, officials said.
In eastern Ilan, a man was swept into the sea while fishing in the rough waters.
Nine people were injured when their van was hit by rockslides in eastern Taitung, police said.
Several domestic airports were closed, and landslides had halted traffic and trapped hundreds of people in mountains in central Taiwan, they said.
In Hong Kong, authorities hoisted the No. 3 typhoon signal, a warning to residents to take precautions as winds were expected to intensify later in the day.
The government said it has opened up several shelters for those seeking refuge from the storm and that more will be opened if needed.
Red flags were raised at Hong Kong beaches to warn swimmers not to enter the water because of rough seas.
Fishing boats sought shelter in the harbor.
In the Philippines, President Joseph Estrada has declared four provinces and a city in the worst hit area on the southern tip of Luzon under a state of calamity.
Officials in calamity zones will be able to use emergency funds and freeze prices of commodities with little red tape.
The Philippine government's Office of Civil Defense said the death toll from Babs has risen to 151.
The fatalities included 71 people who died in landslides in hard hit Catanduanes island and 41 people who drowned, were electrocuted or died in landslides in nearby Camarines Sur province.
Local officials said entire families died in San Miguel town in Catanduanes, where virtually every house was damaged.
Residents began burying their dead in two mass graves Saturday.
Nearly 400000 people were forced out of their homes, disaster relief officials said.
Tens of thousands of others were stranded as ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
Babs was the second devastating storm to hit the Philippines this month.
Two weeks ago, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74 people in the northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.
Philippine weather forecasters said Sunday they were monitoring a low pressure area over the Pacific, about 900 kilometers (558 miles) east of the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, that could strengthen into a storm in two to three days.
From a distance, the smashed coconut and abaca trees scattered on the hills look like broken matchsticks a painful reminder of the destruction left by Typhoon Babs in Catanduanes.
The island province was the first hit by the typhoon, which stalled directly above it for nearly 12 hours.
The storm drenched the hillsides, turning them into a deadly mush that cascaded down on helpless residents seeking higher ground from the rising floodwaters.
At least 69 people from the province died, most of them buried in landslides.
Throughout the Philippines, at least 129 died.
At the height of the storm, water in the Bato River, which snakes through the hills of Catanduanes to the sea, rose more than nine meters (30 feet), reaching the ceilings of some houses.
Most of the buildings are now roofless and many are without walls.
But residents were busy Saturday repairing roofs or making makeshift shelters where their homes once stood.
Some used wire from toppled electrical lines for hanging clothes.
Everyone was drying something furniture, mats, clothes, rice, abaca fiber.
Others scraped mud off the floors of their homes.
Long areas of the shoreline were choked with large and small trees uprooted by the typhoon.
The bark had been scraped clean as they rolled down the mountains to the river and onto the sea.
The entire island was without electricity.
A power barge that supplied electricity to outlying towns was swept down the river and washed out to sea by the punishing wind and waves.
Eddie Tapel, a provincial council member, said entire families were killed in the landslides in San Miguel, including many of his relatives.
"Many children will have to quit school because their families have no more income," he said.
Many people in the area rely mostly on abaca a type of hemp coconuts and fishing for their livelihood.
The abaca trees are now destroyed, and all that is left of most of the coconut trees is the spindly fronds which Filipinos use to make garden brooms.
"In all my 61 years, I haven't experienced a more destructive typhoon," said San Miguel Vice Mayor Alfredo Santillan.
The last major one, he said, struck in October 1970 but passed through Catanduanes in a few hours.
That typhoon packed 275 kph (170 mph) winds and left 2361 dead in the northern Philippines.
"We'll just have to bear it," Santillan said.
"We will recover, but it will take a long while."
Typhoon Babs raced toward southern China on Saturday, leaving behind a trail of destruction on the Philippines' main island where at least 129 people died and hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes.
Philippines President Joseph Estrada declared Catanduanes and three other other provinces and a city in the worst hit area on the southern tip of Luzon under a state of calamity.
He was expected to add more provinces to the list once the full extent of the damage was determined.
Officials in calamity zones will be able to use emergency funds and freeze prices of commodities with little red tape.
Disaster officials said the toll on lives and property would rise as telephone service is restored and roads blocked by landslides and flooding are reopened in the worst hit areas.
Typhoon Babs gained strength as it headed for southern China, packing sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of up to 160 kph (100 mph), the Manila weather bureau said.
At 4 p.m. (0800 GMT), it was located about 370 kilometers (230 miles) west northwest of Vigan in Ilocos Sur province.
Moving at 11 kph (7 mph), it is expected to be 300 kilometers (187 miles) south southeast of Hong Kong by Sunday afternoon.
Of the 129 deaths reported so far in the Philippines, 67 were attributed to landslides on Catanduanes island where Babs first landed on Thursday, the Office of Civil Defense said.
"Catanduanes received the first punch and it was a hard hit," said Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who is overseeing the relief and rescue work.
The worst landslides hit San Miguel, a coconut and abaca producing town along the Bato River, as residents attempted to escape rapidly rising flood waters by climbing hills behind the village.
The powerful winds flattened the abaca and tore away the leaves of the coconut trees, making them look like giant umbrellas with blown away tops.
Virtually every house was damaged.
The dead were to be buried later Saturday in two mass graves.
"Entire families were killed," said Eddie Tapel, a local official.
"Many children will have to quit school because their families have no more income."
Thirty other people died in landslides in nearby Camarines Sur province and another 102 people were injured by flying debris in Sorsogon province, both located in the impoverished Bicol region along the Philippines' eastern coast.
More than 320000 people in the area were forced out of their homes, disaster relief officials said.
Tens of thousands of others were stranded as ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
The fatalities included 18 drownings, three people hit by falling trees, two people electrocuted by power lines, two children killed by a landslide in central Iloilo province, and a fireman crushed to death after his van overturned on a slippery road, officials said.
In the metropolitan Manila area, Estrada ordered at least 10000 people living along swollen creeks and rivers out of their homes and into government shelters.
Many areas in Manila and nearby provinces were still under water early Saturday.
In Pampanga province north of the capital, 35 villages in the township of Candaba were submerged, Mayor Ben Gatus said.
Babs also pounded areas around Mount Pinatubo volcano with heavy rain, unleashing 1.5 meter (5 foot) avalanches of volcanic material from the mountain's slopes.
Most of the material was carried safely away by swollen rivers.
It was second devastating storm in the Philippines in a week.
Last week, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74 people in the northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.
Typhoon Babs weakened into a severe tropical storm Sunday night after it triggered massive flooding and landslides in Taiwan and slammed Hong Kong with strong winds.
The storm earlier killed at least 156 people in the Philippines and left hundreds of thousands homeless.
NATIONAL FORECAST Snow advisories were issued Thursday for the San Juan Mountains in southeast Colorado as moist air drawn northward by a distant upper level low pressure system over northern Nevada was forced to ascend the sloping terrain.
On Friday, the upper level low will weaken as it migrates slowly into western Montana, touching off scattered showers in the northern Rockies and northern Great Basin.
Farther south, isolated showers and a few thunderstorms will develop over the southern Rockies in Arizona, New Mexico and western Colorado as residual moist air left in the wake of the Montana low is lifted over the mountainous terrain.
A chilly, frosty morning over the middle Mississippi and Ohio valleys will be followed by a sunny, mild afternoon under the auspices of a sprawling high pressure system centered over southeast Missouri.
The clockwise circulation of air around the behemoth high will stretch from New England to Florida.
Along Florida's east coast, ocean winds averaging 15 to 30 mph will pile up water at spots along beaches, raising the risk that dangerous rip currents will develop.
Gusts to 40 mph are possible in spots.
Meanwhile, widely separated showers and thunderstorms will form over the peninsula, fueled by inbound ocean moisture.
Across New England, winds from the west will send milder air eastward from the Great Lakes.
However, a warm front marking the leading edge of the advancing milder air will meet with some resistance, paving the way for spotty showers across northern New England.
Focus: Stormy Philippines Supertyphoon Babs, armed with winds over 150 mph, slammed into the Philippine island of Luzon on Wednesday.
The fierce landfall followed on the heels of Supertyphoon Zeb, which lashed Luzon over a week ago.
The long north to south span of the Philippines places the chain squarely within the main migration route of typhoons in the western Pacific, which boasts a higher frequency of tropical storms than any other basin in the world.
The primary reasons for the high frequency of storms are the large expanse of very warm water and favorably steady upper level winds from the east.
Typhoon Babs headed toward southern China Friday after battering the central and northern Philippines with heavy winds and rain that killed at least 82 people, flattened crops, and drove more than 100000 people from their homes.
The toll was expected to rise as contacts are restored with remote areas where roads were blocked by landslides and flooding, and telephone service was knocked out by strong winds.
Among the worst hit areas was the impoverished Bicol region along the Philippines' eastern coast.
At least 53 people were killed in landslides on Catanduanes island, where Babs first hit land Thursday, Office of Civil Defense director Renato Arevalo said.
Seventeen others died in landslides in nearby Camarines Sur province, he said.
Another 102 people were injured by flying debris in Sorsogon province, also part of the Bicol region, Arevalo said.
More than 100000 people in the area were forced to flee their homes, Red Cross officials said.
Tens of thousands of others were stranded as ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
The fatalities included six drownings, two people hit by falling trees, two girls buried by landslides in central Iloilo province, a man who died of shock, and a fireman crushed after his van overturned on a slippery road, officials said.
In Manila, most government offices closed at noon because of the storm.
President Joseph Estrada ordered a forced evacuation of slum dwellers living near swollen rivers.
About 15700 people were removed from low lying areas in the capital, officials said.
"Despite the situation, some people still refuse to leave their homes to guard their meager property," said Jesusa Villanueva, principal of a school being used as an evacuation center.
Some people, cradling chickens and dogs, stood on the roofs of their flooded homes, a few possessions piled next to them.
Others used tire tubes to float toward safer ground.
Hundreds of people living along a seawall near the oceanside U.S. Embassy were evacuated because of high waves.
In suburban Marikina, about 4500 people living on the bank of the swollen Marikina River were also moved to evacuation centers.
At least 12 domestic flights and one international flight were canceled.
In northern Nueva Ecija province, more than 50 people crowded onto the roof of a house in the town of Gapan to escape Babs' floodwaters.
About 88000 hectares (217000 acres) of rice were destroyed in the province, officials said.
Babs also pounded areas around the Mount Pinatubo volcano with heavy rain, unleashing 1.5 meter (5 foot) high avalanches of volcanic material from the mountain's slopes.
Most of the material was carried safely away by swollen rivers.
Late Friday, the storm was centered over the South China Sea, 140 kilometers (88 miles) west northwest of Dagupan City in Pangasinan province, weather officials said.
It had sustained winds of 120 kph (75 mph), with gusts up to 150 kph (94 mph), and was headed toward southern China.
It was second devastating storm in the Philippines in a week.
Last week, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74 people in the northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.
Typhoon Babs brought torrential rains and landslides to Taiwan and lashed Hong Kong with strong winds Sunday after killing at least 156 people in the Philippines and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.
The Hong Kong Observatory said that at 10 p.m. (1400 GMT), the typhoon, packing sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph), was centered about 300 kilometers (186 miles) southeast of the territory.
It was moving at about 10 kph (6.2 mph) toward the south China coast.
The storm was expected to be closest to Hong Kong on Tuesday, the observatory said.
Its outer fringes brought torrential rains to the whole island of Taiwan, with Hualien and several other eastern towns recording more than 500 millimeters (20 inches) of rain in 24 hours, weathermen said.
Authorities evacuated hundreds of people from their homes near flooded rivers.
In Taipei, the main Keelung River has swelled its banks.
One third of Hsichih town was flooded in waist high water, and much of nearby Wutu was also flooded.
Rescuers used rubber boats and trucks to evacuate residents from apartment blocks, officials said.
In eastern Ilan, a man was swept into the sea while fishing in the rough waters.
Nine people were injured when their van was hit by rockslides in eastern Taitung, police said.
Several domestic airports were closed, and landslides had halted traffic and trapped hundreds of people in mountains in central Taiwan, they said.
In Hong Kong, authorities hoisted the No. 3 typhoon signal, a warning to residents to take precautions as gusts of 104 kph (64 mph) were recorded in some places.
The government opened several shelters for those seeking refuge from the storm.
Hong Kong beaches were ordered closed because of rough seas, and fishing boats sought shelter in the harbor.
In the Philippines, President Joseph Estrada has declared four provinces and a city in the worst hit area on the southern tip of Luzon under a state of calamity.
Officials in calamity zones will be able to use emergency funds and freeze prices of commodities with little red tape.
The Philippine government's Office of Civil Defense said the death toll from Babs rose to 156 Sunday.
The fatalities included 71 people who died in landslides in hard hit Catanduanes island and 41 people who drowned, were electrocuted or died in landslides in nearby Camarines Sur province.
Local officials said entire families died in San Miguel town in Catanduanes, where virtually every house was damaged.
Residents began burying their dead in two mass graves Saturday.
Nearly 400000 people were forced out of their homes, disaster relief officials said.
Tens of thousands of others were stranded as ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
Babs was the second devastating storm to hit the Philippines this month.
Two weeks ago, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74 people in the northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.
Philippine weather forecasters said Sunday they were monitoring a low pressure area over the Pacific, about 900 kilometers (558 miles) east of the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, that could strengthen into a storm in two to three days.
Weak consumer demand is expected to have lowered inflation pressure on all commodity groups in the Philippines in October, economists said Wednesday.
The economists said they expect October inflation to be 9.8 percent year on year, down from 10 percent in September.
The data is to be released Thursday.
In the nine months to September, inflation averaged 9.4 percent, lower than the government's target of 10 percent for the year.
Inflation hit double digit levels in May for the first time in nearly two years, when it reached 10.3 percent.
An economic slowdown triggered by the regional financial crisis has caused demand for most consumer items, including basic commodities, to decline over the past few months.
Food prices, which have a hefty weighting on the consumer prices index, have been softening since August.
"With the weak economy, consumers are being very cautious with their purchases and most people (are) sticking to very tight budgets," said Ricky Lozari, an economist at Abacus Securities Corp.
During the second quarter of the year, the country's gross national product shrank 0.7 percent, its first contraction in five years.
Economists expect either no growth or a contraction in the third quarter.
The impact of droughts caused by the El Nino weather condition, which lowered growth in the first half, will not be reflected in the October inflation data, economists say.
"Even if some provinces are still recovering from the effects of the drought, most major agricultural producing provinces have since resumed normal activities," said Luz Lorenzo, research head at ATR Securities Inc. Lorenzo said, however, that recent typhoons could cause inflationary pressures over the next two months.
The Philippines is still recovering from the effects of two typhoons last month that destroyed some 4 billion pesos (dlrs 100 million) worth of crops.
The areas hardest hit by the typhoons account for 55 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
Lorenzo doesn't expect the effect of the typhoons on consumer prices will be dramatic since the government has said it is prepared to import basic commodities such as rice, sugar and corn to make up for any supply shortfall.
"As long as the government is ready to import, prices will remain stable," she said.
Some economists now expect inflation to average 9.6 percent this year, lower than the government's target of 10 percent.
The price of cooking oil in the Philippines has risen drastically this month because of retailers speculating on a shortfall in copra production, the government said Thursday.
Norberto Boceta, deputy administrator of the Philippine Coconut Authority, said the price of cooking oil has jumped by as much as 50 percent this month from prices posted in the first quarter.
Boceta said in a letter to the Department of Trade and Industry that the increase was spurred by retailers speculating on a "perceived copra production shortfall due to the effects of El Nino and the two super typhoons."
Coconut oil is the main ingredient in cooking oil manufactured in the Philippines.
It is extracted from copra, the dried white meat of the coconut.
The country's copra production is expected to drop below 2 million metric tons this year as a result of the drought brought by the El Nino weather phenomenon, which hit coconut farms during the latter part of 1997.
The two typhoons that recently hit the country, Zeb and Babs, have also hurt coconut crops.
Babs, in particular, ravaged the Bicol region, a large coconut producing area.
With hefty 1997 carry over stocks gradually depleting, the losses brought by El Nino and the typhoons are now affecting the supply of copra.
Boceta said speculator activity also takes into account that the last quarter of the year ordinarily is a lean harvest season.
But Boceta is confident that the inflated market will soon give way to supply and demand dynamics.
A spokeswoman for the coconut administration office said the price increase only affects local consumers and that the situation is likely to normalize in a few weeks.
President Joseph Estrada on Thursday donated 600000 pesos (dlrs 15000), the equivalent of his salary for one year, to a fund for victims of recent typhoons in the Philippines, the presidential palace said.
Estrada gave the money to start off a fund raising campaign, and asked other Filipinos to help.
At least two Chinese Filipino associations immediately donated 3 million pesos (dlrs 75000), the palace said.
Estrada also ordered officials of the government run national sweepstakes office to set up six special lotteries and donate the proceeds to victims of the four typhoons that have ravaged the country since September.
The storms left at least 370 people dead, more than 200000 others homeless and millions of dollars worth of crops and property destroyed.
On Wednesday, the Philippine Red Cross sought help from its international counterparts for the victims.
The international Red Cross said it is launching an appeal for 3 million Swiss francs (about dlrs 2.2 million) "in urgent humanitarian assistance."
The last time the Philippine Red Cross sought international help was in 1995, when Typhoon Angela devastated the northern Philippines.
It also requested help following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991, and when a flash flood killed more than 6000 people in central Ormoc City in November that year.
The typhoons damaged or destroyed 10.4 billion pesos (dlrs 252.8 million) worth of infrastructure, crops and other property, according to the civil defense office.
Stray bullets killed two villagers during a gunfight between separatist rebels and police in the northernmost Indonesian region of Aceh on Sunday, witnesses said.
A woman and a child died during the clash at Kandang village, about five kilometers (three miles) east of Lhokseumawe, the capital of North Aceh province, said Yacob Hamzah, a lawyer at the local legal aid office.
Police and military officials were not available for comment.
Aceh, about 1750 kilometers (1100 miles) northwest of Jakarta, is a strongly Muslim province where rebels have been fighting Indonesian forces for the past eight years in a bid to declare an independent Islamic state.
It is one of three Indonesian provinces hit by separatist conflicts.
The other two are Irian Jaya, a former Dutch colony on western New Guinea, and the former Portuguese colony of East Timor.
Rebels in the disputed territory of East Timor were holding two soldiers captive Wednesday after releasing 11 others they abducted in a deadly raid.
Three soldiers and one pro independence activist were killed in the raid Monday on a military post, in which guerrillas stole seven guns, including some M 16 rifles.
Col Tono Suratman, military chief in the former Portuguese colony, threatened an attack on the rebels if they did not free their captives.
"If they're not released, then we will have to use force," he said, adding that troops know where the rebel hideout is.
The soldiers were abducted in an attack by 50 rebels in Manufahi, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili, the capital of East Timor.
In recent days, four other soldiers have been killed in attacks linked to the independence struggle in East Timor, which was invaded by the Indonesian military in 1975.
On Thursday, church Masses and a march are planned to coincide with the seventh anniversary of a massacre in which at least 50 people were killed when Indonesian troops fired on a pro independence protest.
Human rights activists claim at least 200 people were killed.
On Wednesday, hundreds of people staged a candlelight vigil to commemorate the massacre anniversary.
Dozens of buses also brought people from outlying villagers into Dili for Thursday's planned ceremonies.
Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after its troops intervened in a civil war that broke out during the last days of Portuguese rule.
The United Nations still considers Portugal the administering power.
Indonesian legislators on Friday chided a Portuguese effort to extradite former President Suharto, describing the proposal as impossible and unreasonable.
Portugal's attorney general's office is examining a request from lawmaker Nuno Correia da Silva that Suharto be extradited for alleged human rights abuses committed in East Timor a former Portuguese territory annexed by Indonesia in 1976.
Sara Pina, a spokeswoman for the attorney general, said his office was looking at whether it's possible in Portuguese law.
Roestandi, a three star general and chairman of the military faction at Indonesia's Parliament, said such a handover would be "impossible."
"Moreover, it is unreasonable because the East Timor issue is an internal affair of Indonesia," he said.
Meanwhile, Aisyah Amini, chairperson of the Parliament's commission dealing with foreign affairs, also criticized the proposal.
"The East Timor issue is not personal affair of Suharto, but the problem of the nation," she said.
Suharto, 77, ruled Indonesia with an iron fist from 1966 to last May when he was forced to quit following a wave of protests and riots in which 1200 people died.
Suharto's successor and onetime protege, President B.J. Habibie, has offered to grant autonomy to the half island territory in return for international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty there.
Indonesia annexed East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, after invading during a 1975 civil war that broke out when Portugal colonizers left.
Indonesian troops have been accused of widespread abuses in East Timor, 1200 miles (1900 kilometers) east of Jakarta.
Correia da Silva of Portugal's rightist Popular Party likens the bid to extradite Suharto with attempts in Britain to extradite former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet to Spain on charges that include genocide.
Pinochet is in London awaiting a House of Lords panel decision on whether to extradite him.
Indonesia's military said Friday that it was ready to act against a threat from an East Timor rebel group to launch terrorist attacks.
"We will not tolerate any activity that threatens economic or military installations in East Timor or elsewhere in Indonesia," said military spokesman Maj. Gen. Syamsul Ma'arif.
In the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, an East Timorese group opposed to Indonesian rule in the disputed territory said Thursday that it was ready to resort to terrorism if Jakarta does not let six East Timorese asylum seekers leave the country.
Azancot de Menezes, the exiled Lisbon representative of the Timor Socialist Party, said his group was ready to coordinate the attacks with pro independence guerrillas based inside East Timor.
Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, after the departure of Portugal's colonial administration.
The pro independence Timor Socialist Party wants Indonesia to permit the departure of six East Timorese holed up in the Austrian Embassy in Jakarta.
The party's secretary general, Avelino da Silva, his wife and two daughters ages 4 and 6, and two other East Timorese clambered over the embassy compound's walls 14 months ago.
Indonesia's military have accused Da Silva and his wife of being members of a bomb making gang, known as the Black Brigade.
The group allegedly planned to blow up civilian targets in their fight for East Timor's independence.
The Indonesian government has refused to let them leave the country and says they should be prosecuted.
Meanwhile, military officials said an Indonesian soldier was killed early Friday in Manufahi, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili, East Timor capital.
The military blamed pro independence rebels in the killing of the native East Timorese soldier, whose name was still not known.
The rebels also took his gun, said Col Suhartono Suratman, chief of the local military.
Last Friday, two soldiers and one civilian were beaten to death by pro independence activists in Manufahi, he said, without giving further details.
In Lisbon, Jamsheed Marker, the U.N. envoy for East Timor, said late Thursday that Portugal and Indonesia are mulling a new United Nations proposal that envisages broad autonomy for East Timor.
"We've reached a very important, and I might even say critical, moment in the talks," Marker told reporters.
Marker, who was appointed 20 months ago to mediate a settlement on East Timor, was on the second day of a three day visit for talks with Portuguese officials and East Timorese exiles.
UNITED NATIONS Opponents of Indonesia's control over the disputed territory of East Timor said Thursday that documents leaked from the Indonesian Ministry of Defense show that the army is not drawing down its forces in the territory as the government has reported.
The documents date from August, and the situation might have changed since then.
Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali Alatas, has said several times in recent weeks that Indonesia stood by its pledge to keep combat forces out of the territory.
But the documents show a total of more than 12000 Indonesian troops assigned to East Timor, twice the number of soldiers that Indonesia says are based there.
They also show that the Indonesian army, known by its Indonesian acronym Abri, counts among its numbers the members of pro Jakarta local youth groups, militias and public officials with ties to the army.
In the past the Indonesian government has always described these groups as spontaneous organizations.
The military documents put the number of people in these groups at 9000, bringing the total military presence to more than 21000.
A series of Indonesian army tables and charts were made available to The New York Times by the East Timor Action Network, a group that supports independence for the territory.
Human rights groups say they believe the documents are authentic.
The East Timor Action Network plans to make the documents public on Friday.
Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, a year after the former Portuguese colony was abandoned by Lisbon.
The documents cover a period of nine months that ended in August of this year, when a new Indonesian government announced that it had withdrawn more than 1000 combat troops, and said that only about 6000 defense forces remained.
None of the leaked documents track how figures may have changed since then.
Alatas, the foreign minister, is taking part in discussions with the Portuguese under U.N. auspices over the future of East Timor, which Lisbon and Jakarta agree should be given a large measure of autonomy.
The political opening provided by President B.J. Habibie, who took over after the fall of President Suharto in May, has resulted in rising tensions in the territory, and with them reports of new Indonesian military movements.
Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights Watch Asia, said in an interview in New York on Thursday that an increased atmosphere of openness since May has emboldened independence forces among the territory's 800000 people, where calls for a referendum on the region's future are heard more often.
"The government is saying that it is going to give wide ranging autonomy to East Timor," Ms Jones said in New York.
"But at the same time it is beginning to use the term autonomy as synonymous with pro integration, because autonomy means that you accept Indonesian sovereignty."
"The resistance and pro independence forces in East Timor are not only making themselves much more visible than ever before but also challenging that concept of autonomy much more openly than ever before."
"So what used to be the clash between the pro integration and anti integration forces has become widespread tension as a result of differences over support for a referendum which is clearly the popular option and support for autonomy, which is clearly the government position," Ms Jones said.
In Washington, a State Department official said that the United States has not been able to confirm reports that more Indonesian troops are going to East Timor, but that it has also not been able to verify how many were withdrawn in the summer.
"How you count people makes a big difference," the official said.
George Aditjondro, an Indonesian human rights activist who teaches the sociology of corruption at Newcastle University in Australia, where he has documented the wealth of the Suharto family, said on Thursday that he is certain that "the documents came from Cilangkap, Indonesia's Pentagon," and that they are very revealing because of how they count people.
"They tell us that the number of soldiers in the field is nearly twice the number officially mentioned," he said in a telephone interview from Chicago, where he is attending a conference.
"The second thing is that maybe these are the first documents that put the paramilitary units, the counterinsurgency units, on Abri's payroll," Aditjondro said.
"The government previously called them spontaneous youth groups wanting to defend the integration of East Timor."
He added that the documents show that "the presence of the Indonesian state in East Timor is heavily militarized."
More than 100 people held a candlelight vigil outside the Indonesian Embassy Thursday, demanding that President B.J. Habibie put an end to violence in East Timor.
They shouted, "Free East Timor!" and held banners that read "Stop Military Oppression!" as a small group of police watched nearby.
The peaceful protest in Kuala Lumpur was to commemorate the anniversary of a 1991 massacre of anti Indonesian protesters.
Seven years ago, Indonesian troops fired on pro independence protesters in Dili, the East Timor capital.
A government report put the death toll at 50.
Human rights activists say about 200 people were killed.
Earlier, a coalition of Asian activists denounced an offer by Habibie to give East Timor some autonomy in exchange for recognition of Jakarta's sovereignty over the region.
"We call for the Habibie administration to take genuine steps for a peaceful solution in East Timor," said Nadiah Bamadhaj, of the Malaysian East Timor Solidarity Group.
The activists also urged the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group to address the problem.
APEC officials have begun meeting in Kuala Lumpur ahead of the Nov 17 18 summit.
"There is still ongoing struggle in East Timor," said Gus Miclat, of the Manila based Asia Pacific Coalition for East Timor.
"We hope the APEC leaders would address that."
The coalition called for the release of the nearly 200 jailed activists, including rebel leader Xanana Gusmao.
He is serving a 20 year prison term for fighting Indonesian troops.
At the candlelight vigil, Miclat read aloud a message to the protesters that he said was obtained from Xanana in prison.
In the letter, Xanana called Habibie's efforts "an unprecedented step," but said human rights abuses had to stop.
"Jakarta must commit itself to ending the activities of its soldiers, intelligence agents and paramilitary groups that continue to terrorize the population," Xanana said.
Meanwhile, some 10000 mourners gathered at a graveyard in Dili, the provincial capital of East Timor, to lay flowers on the graves of the dead.
They lit candles as police watched from a distance.
Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after its troops intervened in a civil war that broke out during the last days of Portuguese rule.
Assailants killed three soldiers and a civilian in the disputed territory of East Timor, Indonesia's official Antara news agency reported Sunday.
A fourth soldier was missing and believed killed.
The military blamed pro independence activists in the stabbing deaths Friday night of two soldiers and a civilian in Weberek, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili, the capital of East Timor.
Also Friday, masked men shot and killed a soldier in his home in Leorama, west of Dili, the military said.
There were no arrests.
The killings came after several months of relative calm in East Timor's long running guerrilla war, which broke out in 1975 when Indonesian forces invaded the former Portuguese colony.
The head of East Timor's military, Col Suhartono Suratman, said two pistols that the victims in Weberek had been carrying were missing.
Another soldier who was with them was believed killed but his body had not been found, he said.
Citing witness reports, Suratman alleged they were killed by demonstrators who attended a rally organized by the Solidarity Council of Students and Youths, a group that wants a referendum on independence.
Indonesia has ruled out the demand, offering instead a measure of autonomy in exchange for recognition of Indonesian sovereignty and the release of jailed East Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao.
The army sergeant who was killed in Leorama, Josep Florindo Pereira, had just returned home from a service at a Roman Catholic church with his wife, Antara said.
Witnesses said two men shot him in the shoulder and abdomen while he and two other congregation members counted donations collected during the service.
A total of 10 assailants had surrounded the house of the East Timorese native, Antara added.
The killings occurred amid reports that the number of Indonesian troops in East Timor was more than 20000, far in excess of the number claimed by the Indonesian government.
The Indonesian military has said there are 15000 soldiers in East Timor, including 5000 troops engaged in community work such as health care and engineering.
Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after intervening in a civil war.
The United Nations does not recognize Indonesian rule and is sponsoring peace talks between Indonesia and Portugal, the former colonial master.
JAKARTA, Indonesia Indonesia's National Commission on Human Rights will investigate accusations that soldiers executed as many as 50 people this month in the troubled province of East Timor in a military operation against armed rebels, the government said Tuesday.
Marzuki Darusman, the commission's vice president, said a senior commission member would investigate allegations of the executions and of arbitrary arrests by the armed forces between Nov 10 and Nov 16 in the subdistrict of Alas on East Timor's southern coast.
He said the investigator would be Clementino Dos Reis Amaral, a commission member from East Timor.
Citing "very reliable sources," the former Portuguese governor of East Timor, Mario Carrascalao, said Tuesday that he has been told that 42 people had been executed and more than 40 wounded and that 200 others were missing in the Alas area.
Carrascalao, speaking in Jakarta, said he was willing to go himself to help investigate the allegations.
He said the area where the killings were reported was also a site for resettlement of Javanese under a contentious government program.
"I'd like to know the real truth about what happened," he said.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said Tuesday that a team it sent to the area had found "no confirmation of large scale atrocities."
Portugal, the former colonial ruler of East Timor, suspended U.N. brokered talks with Indonesia in New York on Friday after receiving the first reports that civilians had been killed in an area where guerrillas are active.
Carrascalao said the talks were to resume today.
East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed the following year in a move never recognized by the United Nations.
In the East Timor capital, Dili, as many as 2000 East Timorese students continue to occupy the local parliament building in protest against the alleged killings by the Indonesian troops.
The Australian based East Timor Human Rights Center, considered the main watchdog group for East Timorese rights, issued a statement Tuesday accusing the Indonesian military of executing 50 East Timorese and arresting 30 others, including two teen age girls.
It said it had identified 14 of those killed and expressed grave fears for the safety of the detainees.
"The killings and arrests in the Alas subdistrict have followed the recent buildup of Indonesian troops in the area," the report said, adding that the alleged killings may have been in retaliation for an attack on the troops by rebels of the East Timorese Armed Resistance in which three Indonesian soldiers were killed and 13 captured.
The report said that following the rebel attack on Nov 9, troops attacked a village on Nov 13, arresting and later killing the chief and four other people.
A report in the Dili based newspaper Suara Timor Timur quotes the Indonesian military chief of East Timor, Col Tono Suratman, as confirming the death of the chief, Vicente Xavier, and calling him a ringleader of the rebel attacks.
A U.N. envoy said Wednesday he was making progress in his efforts to mediate a settlement between Portugal and Indonesia on the disputed territory of East Timor, news reports said.
"Progress has been made and we'll pursue the (East) Timor issue with great commitment," United Nations mediator Jamsheed Marker was quoted as saying by the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
Marker, who was appointed 20 months ago to break the long standing deadlock over East Timor, was in Lisbon for three days of talks with government officials, lawmakers and exiled East Timorese independence activists.
He said he was skeptical about recent reports of an Indonesian army offensive against a small band of pro independence guerillas operating out of the jungle in East Timor's interior.
"From what I know from the talks I've had with the Indonesian authorities, I think it's quite unlikely they carried out such an action," Marker was quoted as saying by Lusa.
East Timorese opponents of Indonesia's rule claimed Sunday that some 2000 Indonesian troops supported by helicopters launched an attack on the rebels.
Jakarta denied the claim.
Portuguese officials expressed concern about the reports, saying they could undermine confidence building measures.
Indonesia invaded the territory of 800000 people in December 1975, a few months after the departure of Portugal's colonial administration.
It annexed the territory, 1200 miles (1900 kilometers) east of Jakarta, a month later.
The resignation of authoritarian Indonesian President Suharto in May and the democratic changes introduced under his successor, B.J. Habibie, have brought fresh impetus to negotiations for a solution.
Portugal and Indonesia are mulling a new proposal to settle their dispute over East Timor, and talks between the two sides are at a crucial stage, according to a U.N. envoy.
Envoy Jamsheed Marker said late Thursday that the U.N. proposal envisages broad autonomy for the disputed Southeast Asian territory.
"We've reached a very important, and I might even say critical, moment in the talks," Marker told reporters after a dinner with President Jorge Sampaio.
He said the U.N. plan includes "a proposal for very wide ranging autonomy for East Timor," a former Portuguese colony that Indonesia invaded in 1975 and later annexed.
Lisbon and Jakarta have agreed to discuss the proposal which was "couched in legal terms" and could provide the foundation for a future Constitution for East Timor, Marker said, though he declined to give further details.
Marker, who was appointed 20 months ago to mediate a settlement on East Timor, was on the second day of a three day visit for talks with Portuguese officials and East Timorese exiles.
After the May resignation of authoritarian President Suharto, Indonesia proposed granting some degree of autonomy to the territory of 800000 people, but insisted on retaining control over its defense, economic and foreign policy.
Portugal and East Timorese pro independence groups rejected that proposal and insisted a referendum be held inside the territory to decide its future.
A Foreign Office minister said Monday that the British phone company whose four employees were kidnapped in Chechnya at the weekend was specifically warned to withdraw from Russia's breakaway region, but ignored the advice.
"The advice could not have been clearer, the risks were known to the company and to the employees," said Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
"The fact that they ignored that advice is a decision they took themselves and is their responsibility ,It's a mature world and people have to take mature decisions."
The company, Granger Telecom, said it knew Chechnya was probably the world's most dangerous place for kidnapping but thought its staff would be well protected because they were working on a government contract to install a telecommunications system.
Three of the kidnaped men, Britons Darren Hickey and Rudolph Petschi and New Zealander Stanley Shaw, worked for Granger.
The British company said the fourth hostage, Briton Peter Kennedy, may have been employed directly by Chechen Telecom, which has offered a reward for information about the kidnapping.
The men were seized early Saturday after a shoot out with their bodyguards.
There was no word on any ransom demand for the four men.
"We had a general advice from the Foreign Office about visits to Chechnya but no specific advice about us," Granger Telecom chief executive Ray Verth told the BBC.
Verth, who has now suspended operations in Chechnya, said the company had considered the contract, worth several million dollars, justified the risk.
The company was 12 months into a five year contract to install 300000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
Hickey had been in the region since early August and was due back in Britain this week, said Verth.
Shaw had been in Chechnya only a week and Petschi for 2 1/2 weeks.
"None of our employees were forced to go, they voluntarily went they knew the risks," said Verth.
"We understood and believed they were well catered for because we were contracted with the Chechen government and Chechen Telecom, who guaranteed our safety, which obviously has not occurred."
Fatchett said Britain would do all it could to get the men released.
Hickey's sister said Monday his family is devastated.
"He was just out there doing a job to help the country get their communications back," said a tearful Deborah Hickey, 21.
Hickey, who is single and lives with his parents at Thames Ditton, south of London, had been to Chechnya twice before, she said, "and he thought there was no danger at all," despite having heard gunfire on a previous trip "he said that was part of it."
She did not blame Granger.
"Darren is old enough to make his own decision to go out there or not," she said.
The Russian news agency ITAR Tass on Monday quoted Magomed Magomadov, Chechen deputy procurator general, as saying one of the kidnappers was wounded and received treatment at the district hospital in Urus Martan.
The men were seized just two weeks after Chechen warlords released two British charity workers who had been held for 14 months.
London's Guardian newspaper said Monday that the latest kidnappings "cast fresh doubt on Foreign Office claims to have paid no ransom" to secure the release of the charity workers.
The British Embassy in Moscow has received no direct information about three Britons and a New Zealander kidnapped in breakaway Chechnya nearly two weeks ago, an embassy official said Wednesday.
No ransom demands have been made for the hostages, said an embassy spokeswoman, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity.
The hostages Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw were kidnapped on Oct 3.
They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company, installing 300000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
Chechnya's security forces launched a 10 day crackdown last week, seeking to capture rebel armed groups and possibly find leads to the hostages.
A particularly thorough search was being conducted in Chechnya's mountainous regions, where hostages are usually held.
No trace of the Britons and the New Zealander have been found, Chechen officials have said.
Hostage takings, usually for ransom, have become common in Chechnya since the end of its two year war for independence from Russia in 1996.
Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said, according to the Interfax news agency.
Another high profile hostage, Russian presidential envoy Valentin Vlasov, who was kidnapped on May 1, remains missing.
Unknown gunmen abducted three Britons and a New Zealand citizen in Russia's breakaway Chechnya region after a shootout with their bodyguards, a regional official said Sunday.
The four men, who were in Chechnya to install a cellular phone system, were taken hostage Saturday after 20 men in camouflage attacked the house where they lived in the Chechen capital Grozny, said Shadid Bargishev, head of the regional anti kidnapping department.
The British Foreign Office initially said the four were seized early Sunday morning, but later said the kidnapping had taken place at 4 a.m. Saturday.
It appealed to Russian authorities "for their cooperation for the safe and early return of the men."
One bodyguard and an unknown number of attackers were wounded in the fire fight, the Interfax news agency said.
Police were searching regional hospitals for anyone coming in with gunshot wounds.
The British Embassy in Moscow identified the four hostages as Britons Peter William Kennedy, Darren Eamonn Hickey, and Rudolf Franz Joseph Petschi, and Stanley Frederick James Shaw of New Zealand.
They were working for Granger Telecom, a British firm based in Waybridge, Surrey, that has been working with the Chechen telecommunications company, an embassy spokesman said.
The kidnappers have not set conditions for the men's release, the spokesman said.
The kidnapping took place only 500 meters (550 yards) from the anti kidnapping department, Interfax said.
Policemen heard the shots, but didn't react because gunfire is frequent in the evening in Grozny, the report said.
"Despite the fact that the government of Britain did not recommend that its citizens visit Chechnya, these four came and did not inform anybody about their presence, not even law enforcement bodies," Bargishev said.
The British Foreign Office said that Britons have been advised not to go to Chechnya for the last 4 1/2 years.
The incident "will seriously slow down the plan for Chechnya's revival," said Leon Wascinski, head of the Chechen mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, according to Interfax.
The kidnappers "whoever they are, are acting in defiance of the interests of the Chechen people and are doing so deliberately," he said.
The kidnapping came just two weeks after Chechen warlords released two British charity workers, ending the pair's 14 months of captivity in the turbulent republic in Russia's northern Caucasus region.
Hundreds of Russian and foreign citizens have been abducted by gangs seeking ransom since the 1994 1996 independence war with Russia, and dozens remain held.
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov's government has been unable to stem kidnappings that have become a steady business for some criminal gangs.
Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running its own affairs since Russian troops left two years ago.
Moscow says that Chechnya remains part of Russia but has no control over its affairs.
MOSCOW The severed heads of four kidnapping victims identified as three Britons and a New Zealander were found Tuesday on the side of a road in Chechnya, the breakaway region on Russia's southern border that emerged undefeated from a brutal war two years ago only to be engulfed by a wave of kidnappings and crime.
The gruesome killings heightened alarm and outrage about the volatile situation in the region, which spun out of Moscow's control long ago.
Until now, local kidnappers have usually kept their hostages alive in hopes of receiving ransom money, which has become a major source of income in an economy devastated by Russia's 21 month war against Chechen secessionists.
Although the corpses have not yet been found, Chechen officials said Tuesday that they had been able to identify the victims as four employees of a British telecommunications company.
They were kidnapped from their house in the Chechen capital, Grozny, by two dozen armed men on Oct 3, after a shootout with their bodyguards.
The British government, in a statement Tuesday night condemning the "repugnant murders," said it was awaiting final confirmation of the victims' identity.
"It is a horrifying crime, committed against the international community," said Manolis Chikhkiyev, an aide to Ruslan Aushev, president of Ingushetia, a region that borders Chechnya.
"Ordinary criminals wouldn't kill their hostages, which means that this situation is much deeper and more complex."
An estimated 100 kidnap victims including several foreigners, as well as Russian servicemen are still being held in Chechnya and neighboring regions in the northern Caucasus.
In neighboring Dagestan, kidnappers seized Herbert Gregg, an American teacher, on Nov 12 as he was leaving a local orphanage.
His whereabouts are unknown.
In recent months, the Chechen government has mounted a new campaign to crack down on the kidnapping gangs, an effort that was set back in October by a car bomb that killed the leader of its special anti terrorist squad.
The Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov, has accused his political opposition and "foreign agents" of using kidnapping as a weapon in its campaign to unseat him.
But the crime wave is also attributed to competing local chieftans, Muslim extremists and other groups that have been feeding off the lawlessness and anarchy that has swept the region.
Last October, a Russian official, Akmal Saidov, was found strangled to death several days after he had been abducted.
The motive was judged to be political after a note signed by the "wolves of Islam" was reportedly found on his body, vowing death to those who work for the Russian secret service.
Fear of kidnapping has left Chechnya isolated from the rest of the world, as journalists, aid workers and foreign investors keep a wary distance from a region now so impoverished that according to one local resident, some people are reduced to a diet of animal feed.
Yelena Masyuk, one of three Russian television journalist kidnapped and then released last year after payment of $2 million in ransom, said at an international conference last May that the kidnappings had cost Chechnya the sympathy it had won when Russian troops were bombing its capital and killing its civilians.
"Chechens made $16 million on journalists last year, but they lost much more," she said.
"They lost the journalists' confidence that they had had during the war."
The result, she said, was "an information blockade" against the region and its 1 million inhabitants.
In the meantime, the Russian government, while refusing to recognize Chechen independence, has virtually no authority in the region, and has dispersed little of the money it pledged for postwar reconstruction.
There have been successes in the war against the kidnappers such as the release last month of President Boris Yeltsin's personal envoy to the region, Valentin Vlasov, after six months of captivity.
In the last two months, 55 Russian servicemen who had been held captive have been returned to Moscow.
And in September, a pair of British aid workers were flown back to England, where they told harrowing tales of abuse by their captors.
Most released hostages have reported that their captors were careful to keep them alive, if barely, so as to be able to collect their reward.
One hostage, released this year after several months of captivity and speaking on condition of anonymity, described being held in cold, wet basements, wearing the same set of clothes until they rotted on his body.
Masked guards would deliver meager food rations at irregular intervals, and periodically move their prisoners to different locations, always at night.
In his case, the motive for the kidnapping was clear.
"Their goal was only money," he said, "and they don't hide this."
But even the hostage releases have only added fuel to the politically charged atmosphere in the region, as competing groups accuse each other of getting rich on the ransoms.
Last month, Maskhadov accused a Russian financier, Boris Berezovsky, of fueling the kidnapping industry by paying out huge ransoms.
Berezovsky who has played an open role in negotiating the release of a number of hostages has routinely denied the charges, although he has said he provided humanitarian assistance, computers and textbooks to Chechnya in an effort to secure good will.
"I tried to do everything possible on my side to stop this mess," he said Tuesday.
"Until this case, we were lucky."
Russian Interior Ministry officials have insisted that Vlasov was released after a special operation mounted with the aid of troops from Ingushetia, without the participation of any Chechen forces.
However, Chechen officials contend that in this case, too, a ransom was paid.
"Money has been paid in every case," said Sharip Yusupov, a Chechen living in Moscow, who for five years was Chechnya's representative in the Russian capital.
Yusupov said he thought the brazen killing of the four telecommunications specialists was a sign that the kidnappers no longer expect to get ransom money from Russian officials.
"The kidnapping industry is no longer profitable," he said, "which left these people without a 'master.'
They were caught in a squeeze."
According to another theory, the kidnappers may have killed their victims because they feared they were about to be caught.
Maskhadov, at a news conference in Grozny Tuesday, said that a captured suspect had begun to give information last week about the location of the kidnappers.
In London, a spokesman for Granger Telecom, the British company that employed the men, said they had had word last week that the hostages were safe.
Chechen authorities found the decapitated heads of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village after a two month search in the breakaway region in southern Russia.
An Associated Press reporter saw the severed heads near the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Grozny, the Chechen capital.
He did not see any sign of the bodies.
The heads were identified as those of the four abducted foreigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to the four when they were abducted Oct 3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny.
He said the bodies had not been found.
But Chechen government officials at the scene said four bodies had been found without giving further details.
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny that the bodies of four men had been recovered.
The hostages Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw were engineers.
They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company, installing 300000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
Maskhadov said Chechen officials had caught one of the captors Monday and he told police where the hostages were being held.
But that information reached the other captors, who decided to kill their captives, the ITAR Tass news agency quoted Maskhadov as saying.
The chief executive of Granger Telecom, Ray Verth, said Tuesday that Chechen authorities had mounted a rescue attempt Monday night that went "tragically wrong."
No other details were available.
He said the company had "opened a dialogue with the kidnappers and received confirmation that the hostages were alive as recently as last week."
"Their murder is an appalling and barbaric act and our thoughts go out to the families to whom we offer our deepest condolences.
We are a small tightly knit company and everyone here is in a state of shock," Verth said outside company headquarters in Weybridge, south of London, where flags were flying at half mast.
Spokesmen at the British and New Zealand embassies in Moscow said they were checking on reports the four men had been killed, but could not comment.
The British Foreign Ministry in London said it was investigating urgently reports that bodies had been found.
Chechen acting First Vice Premier Turpal Atgeriyev, who is heading the investigation into the killings, said authorities had several suspects in the abduction, but have failed to make any progress, according to the ITAR Tass news agency.
Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said he heard the news and was hoping it would not be confirmed.
"There is so much rumor and counter rumor coming from out there that we don't know what to think.
Obviously we are hoping and praying that it does not turn out to be true," he said at his home in England.
Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men for the past two months.
British officials said they had not received any ransom demand for the missing men.
Maskhadov said the deaths of the four men were a major blow to Chechnya and its efforts to gain international recognition of its independence.
He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya to unidentified "outside forces" and their Chechen henchmen.
"I am ready to answer before my people and the whole world for what happened," he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

A bomb exploded in a car carrying a senior Muslim cleric in breakaway Chechnya on Thursday, but he was not hurt, Russian news agencies reported.
Mufti Akhmad Khadzhi Kadirov was approaching his home in the Chechen capital of Grozny when the bomb went off under his Mercedes 600, wounding his driver, ITAR Tass and Interfax reported.
Kadirov and his bodyguard managed to scramble out of the burning car after the blast, which also destroyed a small building and blew out windows nearby.
The attack came one day after a similar car bomb killed Chechnya's top anti kidnapping official, Shadid Bargishev.
Anti kidnapping officials blamed the attack on Bargishev's promise to launch an all out offensive against hostage takers, and his recent success in securing the release of several captives, including a British couple and 24 Russian soldiers.
"The accident is a result of the work of the (anti kidnapping) department," said Husein Zabrailov, an investigator who worked with Bargishev.
Chechnya's first deputy security minister, Abu Movsayev, said that the Russian military may have been behind the killing.
Bargishev had recently challenged a claim by the Russian prosecutor general's office that it had freed the Russian servicemen from captivity, Movsayev said.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry in the southern Russian region of Dagestan offered Monday to help combat hostage taking in neighboring Chechnya after the attack on Bargishev, ITAR Tass said, citing the ministry's press center.
Chechnya, where rebels fought a bloody independence war against Russia in 1994 96, conducts its own affairs and has seen a sharp rise in violent crime and hostage taking, usually by criminal gangs for ransom.
Dagestan suffers from its own ethnic conflicts, and has also been hit by spillover violence and kidnappings by armed gangs in Chechnya.
More than 100 people are still being held captive in Chechnya, including three Britons, a New Zealander and a Turk, according to Interfax.
Chechen officials said the bodies of four kidnapped foreigners had been found Tuesday near a remote village.

Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said the bodies of four men had been recovered.
There was no immediate explanation for the discrepencies.
Kidnapping of foreigners for ransom is rampant in Chechnya, a lawless region in southern Russia.
But victims are rarely killed.
Hundreds of thousands of pieces of Swissair Flight 111, representing 60 percent of the plane, have now been retrieved from the ocean floor, but an explanation for the Sept 2 crash remains far off, investigators said Tuesday.
Benoit Bouchard, chairman of Canada's Transportation Safety Board, predicted it would take longer than the normal 12 months to complete a final report on the crash off the Nova Scotia coast that killed all 229 people aboard the New York to Geneva flight.
"It's a very complicated and complex investigation," Bouchard said.
"But I remain optimistic that we will identify any safety deficiencies that may exist."
As of two weeks ago, only 10 percent of the wrecked MD 11 jet had been recovered.
Then a barge equipped with an underwater crane was brought in to scoop up large pieces of the plane.
Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator, said the operation was a success, retrieving all three of the engines, parts of the fuselage and cockpit, as well as electronic circuit boards and bundles of wiring that will be examined for possible clues into the source of smoke that the pilots detected 16 minutes before the crash.
Some debris from the cockpit area shows signs of extreme heat, but investigators have yet to establish any details about the cause or extent of a possible fire on board.
"We're really just now at the stage where we have quite a bit of aircraft to examine," Gerden said.
He said investigators still don't know at what angle the plane hit the water and hope that digital controls in the engines may give an indication of the plane's speed at impact.
The impact was so severe that all the victims' bodies were badly fragmented, complicating the identification process.
Dr John Butt, Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, joined investigators at a news briefing in Halifax on Tuesday to report that remains of 134 people have now been identified, mostly through matching with DNA samples provided by relatives.
He said 228 distinct DNA patterns have now been detected from the remains, indicating remains from all but one of the people on board has been found.
Gerden said the heavy lifting barge, the Sea Sorceress, has completed its work, and will be replaced this week by a boat normally used to drag up scallops.
Its task will be to retrieve the smaller debris that remains on the ocean floor, about 180 feet (55 meters) below the surface.
Though the final report is probably more than a year away, Bouchard said the safety board would issue provisional recommendations at any point when investigators felt they had detected a safety hazard, "We will do everything we can to reduce risks associated with flying," he said.
WASHINGTON After the crash of Swissair Flight 111, the airline gave the grieving familes of the victims all the help customarily offered in such disasters.
It brought them to Halifax, booked them in hotels and bused them to the crash site.
But then it gave them something more unusual: space on the airline's web page to speak out.
Now, on a new different bulletin board, set up on Yahoo, the families are pouring out their souls about the crash.
It is a new way of grieving that has also been used by families of the victims of other crashes.
"This is a bit strange for me, I don't really know what to write or how to begin," said one posting, by a woman named Mette, who said her father died in the Sept 3 crash that took 229 lives.
"I just feel a need to.
I want to try all possible ways of dealing with all the emotions and confusion."
"I am wondering if there are any other people out there around my age (19) who lost someone on the flight and would like to communicate with me," Mette continued.
Two days later, a woman who lost both her parents on the plane responded.
Despite Swissair's offer of space on its web site, relatives of the victims said they ultimately decided to move to Yahoo because they felt that they needed a more neutral space.
Monica Hawkins, whose cousin, Jay Jasan, died on the flight, said the Swissair site "kind of felt funny," partly because they knew Swissair personnel were reading their postings.
Miles Gerety, who lost a brother, Pierce, on the plane, asked his 13 year old son to handle the technical aspects of the bulletein board.
The boy created a Yahoo club, a combination of message boards, chat rooms, e mail message lists, member lists, a links area, calendars and archive information.
"You have to have a 13 year old," said Gerety, who is a public defender in Connecticut and said he could not have set up the bulletin board on his own.
The site has a counter to monitor usage: it recently showed 35 members logged in, with a total of 1019 page views for the day, and three new members who had joined the club.
For now, everyone can read their postings.
But Gerety and Ms Hawkins, who are the acting chairman and vice chair of an organization of Swissair disaster families announced early this month, said they would create a private bulletin board once they had more relatives signed up.
The organization can be reached at clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/familiesofswissairflight111.
The family association can be reached by mail at P.O. Box B, Redding Ridge, Conn. 06876.
Relatives from this crash and previous ones said that some of the characteristics that are generally seen as e mail's weaknesses suddenly become strengths for people trying to cope with a crash, especially the detached nature of the communications.
"You can sit down and put your thoughts down," said Jane B. Lathem of Alpharetta, Ga., whose son, Ray W. Lathem, died on the crash of Valujet Flight 592 in May, 1996.
"People find it easier to open up when they're not face to face.
The site is at flight592.com Some of the Swissair postings show people grapping both with grief and a new technology.
"This is the first time I have written a message at this site, or any other for that matter.
I'm really not really sure what to write, but I feel that I really want to," wrote Linda Arnmark, whose father, Per Spanne, was on the flight.
"Maybe writing to you all is a good way to deal with what has happened."
James N. Landrum, of Plano, Texas, whose wife's sister, Terri Bell, died on the Valujet flight, said he pays $15 a month for the 40 megabytes of disk space it takes to run the site Landrum, a computer systems engineer, said he is trying to get the transcript of the National Transportation Safety Board's hearing from a CD ROM unto the web site, but the CD ROM stores the transcript as pictures of pages, not text files, and converting it is laborious.
Landrum said that message traffic picked up around the second anniversary of the crash and again when the Swissair plane crashed.
Swissair "did everything correctly" in installing a state of the art entertainment system switched off last month in the wake of the crash of Flight 111, the airline's chief executive said in an interview published Sunday.
Swissair acted voluntarily to disconnect the video on demand system, connected to a power supply routed through the cockpit, after Canadian investigators detected signs of heat damage on wiring and other debris from the ceiling around the cockpit of the MD 11.
"It's the leading product, customers liked it, and its installation was correctly certified," CEO Jeffrey Katz was quoted as saying in the Zurich weekly SonntagsZeitung.
"As far as we know now, we did everything correctly."
Swissair is the only customer for the system, manufactured by Phoenix based Interactive Flight Technologies Inc.

Swissair lawyers are looking at procedures for making payments of up to around dlrs 137000 to families of those killed in last month's crash off Nova Scotia, a spokesman for the airline said Tuesday.
The compensation payments correspond to Swissair's liability under its general conditions of carriage and are independent of any responsibility for the crash, spokesman Martin Kaspar said.
No date could be given for payments, which would be deductible from a future settlement, he added.
Exact entitlements have yet to be established.
All 229 passengers and crew aboard Flight 111 from New York to Geneva were killed when the airliner plunged into the sea off Peggy's Cove.
The causes of the crash have not been determined.
Immediately after the crash, Swissair offered families an immediate dlrs 20000 payment to cover their expenses.
More than 130 families have taken up that offer, Kaspar said.
Swissair is among carriers that over the last few years have opted out of a dlrs 75000 liability cap for people killed or injured during international flights.
The airline and manufacturers Boeing have already been served with a dlrs 50 million lawsuit by former boxing champion Jake LaMotta, who lost his son.
The lawsuit claims the companies should have known about wiring problems on the McDonnell Douglas aircraft a possible cause of the accident and did little to correct them.
Hundreds of thousands of pieces of Swissair Flight 111, representing 60 percent of the plane, have now been retrieved from the ocean floor, but an explanation for the Sept 2 crash remains far off, investigators said Tuesday.
Benoit Bouchard, chairman of Canada's Transportation Safety Board, predicted it would take longer than the normal 12 months to complete a final report on the crash off the Nova Scotia coast that killed all 229 people aboard the New York to Geneva flight.
"It's a very complicated and complex investigation," Bouchard said.
"But I remain optimistic that we will identify any safety deficiencies that may exist."
As of two weeks ago, only 10 percent of the wrecked MD 11 jet had been recovered.
Then a barge equipped with an underwater crane was brought in to scoop up large pieces of the plane.
Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator, said the operation was a success, retrieving all three of the engines, parts of the fuselage and cockpit, as well as electronic circuit boards and bundles of wiring that will be examined for possible clues into the source of smoke that the pilots detected 16 minutes before the crash.
Some debris from the cockpit area shows signs of extreme heat, but investigators have yet to establish any details about the cause or extent of a possible fire on board.
"We're really just now at the stage where we have quite a bit of aircraft to examine," Gerden said.
He said investigators still don't know at what angle the plane hit the water and hope that digital controls in the engines may give an indication of the plane's speed at impact.

Temperatures rose to 300 degrees (570 degrees F) without leaving traces of fire in the front part of Swissair Flight 111 before it crashed, an in house publication of the airline said Thursday.
There still is no indication of the source of the heat, said the publication, "News."
It described as "pure speculation" theories that a fire was caused by an electrical short that ignited insulation material.
The MD 11 airliner flying from New York to Geneva crashed Sept 2 off the coast of Canada, killing all 229 people aboard.
The crew reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes before the crash.
Investigators, who have found that high heat melted plastic in the first 40 feet (12 meters) of the plane, were surprised that the heat was in the upper part of the plane and not below the cockpit floor, where most of the wiring is located, the newsletter said.
Previous reports have said the temperature was high enough to damage plastic, but the newsletter gave the first indication of just how hot it was.
The newsletter, published for the staff by the airline's parent SAirGroup, said the findings by Canadian investigators were disclosed by Hans Ulrich Beyeler, Swissair head of technology, in a speech to the Technical Society of Zurich.
Last week, the airline announced it was switching off a state of the art entertainment system on its remaining 15 MD 11s and three Boeing 747s as a precautionary measure.
Swissair said the video on demand system for first and business class was being disconnected from a power supply network routed through the cockpit because it was nonessential and because that is the area where the investigation is concentrated.
The newsletter said 90 percent of the wreckage has been recovered.
WASHINGTON The Federal Aviation Administration said on Thursday that it would consider whether airliners can get too old to fly, which would be a change from its longstanding belief that jets are eternal if they are inspected often enough.
As a first step, the agency said it would expand a program that focuses on the problems of aging aircraft.
That program, which has been limited to a study of the skeleton and skin of aging aircraft, was started after an accident in 1988 in which the fuselage of an Aloha Airlines jetliner peeled apart like a sardine can.
On Thursday morning, Rodney Slater, the secretary of transportation, announced a plan to evaluate nonstructural systems, including wiring and hydraulic systems.
"Today's U.S. fleet has an average age of nearly 16 years," Slater said.
"Ten years from now, a larger and older fleet will have an average age of 18 to 20 years."
Some planes are much older than 16.
Northwest Airlines said earlier this year that it expects to fly its DC 9's for 42 years.
Once a plane has been manufactured, nearly all FAA requirements are based on aircraft performance, with the agency ordering inspection or repair after it gets reports from planes in the field or in the shop that parts have deteriorated.
This approach may not suffice for wiring, though, because some wires are hard to see.
And even if the wires are visually inspected, deterioration is hard to find, experts say.
Wiring in older planes has been under intense scrutiny by the agency since the explosion of TWA Flight 800, a 25 year old Boeing 747, off Long Island on July 17, 1996.
The crash, which killed 230 people, led to the discovery of wiring problems in various older planes.
Jane Garvey, the administrator of the FAA, said the agency would undertake a five year study of older aircraft systems, in part to determine "whether or not there should be a life expectancy for some of the wiring."
In practice, experts say, if airlines had to replace a lot of wiring on older planes it would be a death sentence for the planes.
One of the few components automatically replaced at a certain age is the commercial airline pilot, they have to retire at 60.
In response to a question, Ms Garvey said it was not clear where "older" began.
Asked about Swissair Flight 111, a 7 year old MD 11 that crashed off Nova Scotia on Sept 2, she said she was not clear whether planes that age would be covered by the new program.
Ms Garvey and other aviation officials confirmed on Thursday that they were interested in whether mylar insulation used on that plane may have encouraged the spread of fires in other accidents.
But a spokesman for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, which is in charge of the investigation of the Swissair crash, said the Mylar insulation recovered from the plane did not show heat damage.
The Washington Post reported on Thursday that investigators were interested in the insulation blankets, although there is no evidence that they played a role in the Swissair fire and subsequent crash, which killed all 229 people aboard.
The Boeing Company recommended a year ago that the blankets be replaced at the next major maintenance overhaul.
But Hans Klaus, a spokesman for Swissair, said that the plane that crashed had not had a major overhaul since that recommendation was made, and that it had its last overhaul in August 1997, 13 months before the crash.
Replacement of the blankets has not been required by the FAA or any other agency, Klaus said, adding that Swissair has not decided whether to replace the blankets on its other planes.
About 15 large airlines that fly MD 11's and other McDonnell Douglas planes began a two day meeting on Thursday in Long Beach, Calif., where the planes were manufactured.
They are going over the approximately 20 outstanding recommendations from the manufacturer on smoke and fire problems to determine whether any of the work should be accelerated in response to the Swissair crash, said a Boeing spokesman, John Dern.
In Halifax, Nova Scotia, a spokesman for Canada's Transportation Safety Board, Jim Harris, said that some of the blankets had been recovered but that they showed no fire damage.
Less than 10 percent of the plane has been recovered so far, and very little of that was from the cockpit area, which is what most interests the investigators, he said.
Harris said salvage workers in the Canadian and United States navies planned to begin raising small pieces of wreckage in larger batches soon in an effort to recover more before the weather made such work impossible.
Divers have recovered a computer that controls one of the three engines, he said, and investigators have sent it to Pratt and Whitney, in East Hartford, Conn., in the hope that technicians there can retrieve data from its memory chips.
WASHINGTON Investigators looking into the crash last month of Swissair Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia have found "heat damage" in wires from the plane's in flight entertainment system, prompting the airline to disconnect the system on all of its jumbo jets, Swissair officials said Thursday.
The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said in a statement that there was not enough information to determine whether the heat damage was a possible source of the smoke that the pilots reported in the cockpit shortly before the crash, or whether it was "merely the byproduct of other events."
One aviation safety official called it "a circumstantial clue."
The entertainment system installed by Swissair is apparently not used by any other airline, although the Federal Aviation Administration which approved the installation for Swissair said that if it found an airline using the same equipment, it would ask that the system be turned off.
The system is installed on the first class and business class seats of Swissair's 15 surviving MD 11s and its three 747s.
It includes a video screen that unfolds from the armrest like a tray table and can be used by a passenger to watch a variety of movies or play casino style games.
A spokeswoman for the airline, Jackie Pash, stressed that investigators had not determined what role, if any, the system played in the crash.
"People are going to immediately think this is a cause of 111, and that has not been determined at all," she said.
"Swissair is interested in taking any precautionary measures, as you can imagine."
About 70 percent of the plane has been recovered, and work is continuing to find more of it.
From the parts that have been recovered, investigators have found that much of the heat damage is concentrated in an area above the ceiling, over the wall that divides the cockpit from the first class cabin.
Jim Harris, a spokesman for the Transportation Safety Board, said that the forward area, the area that is of the greatest interest to investigators, is also the most badly shattered, apparently having hit first.
The investigators recently identified wiring from the entertainment system as being heat damaged and coming from that area over the wall.
The plane crashed on Sept 2, on a flight from Kennedy International Airport in New York to Switzerland, killing all 229 people aboard.
The pilots had reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes before the crash.
Investigators have avoided using the word "fire," saying instead that components are heat damaged.
The system was designed and manufactured by Interactive Flight Technologies of Phoenix, a company that subsequently got out of the business because it could not make additional sales.
A spokeswoman, Marsha Malone, said Thursday that she could not give any information about the system installed on the Swissair planes.
Les Dorr, a spokesman for the FAA, said his agency had inspected one Swissair MD 11, concentrating on the wiring in the forward part of the plane, including the entertainment system, and that Swissair itself had inspected three more that were undergoing maintenance.
No safety problems were found on any of the planes, he said.
He added that the inspections were "in areas that were readily accessible, where we didn't have to take anything apart."
He said that the FAA was re examining the design and installation of the system on the Swissair planes, but that the agency had not asked any other airlines to inspect their entertainment systems.
Such systems are a major point of competition among airlines offering first class or business class service over long routes.
They can require large amounts of electric current, and thus generate substantial heat.
David Sebring, the chief engineer for cabin systems at Boeing Co., said in an interview in August that on a big jet the system can use 30 kilowatts enough electricity to run several large suburban houses.
WASHINGTON The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday abruptly ordered airlines that fly MD 11s to inspect two cockpit switches because one model in wide use can give off smoke at certain settings.
But such switches did not cause the crash of the MD 11 being flown as Swissair Flight 111 on Sept 2, aviation authorities said, because the cockpit switches in that plane had already been changed.
Since the Swissair crash, near Halifax, Nova Scotia, the FAA has been reviewing trouble reports on the plane and recommendations from the manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, its action Thursday was to make one of those recommendations mandatory.
The switches are dimmer switches for cockpit instruments.
"The real safety issue is not fire, it's smoke in the cockpit," said FAA spokesman Les Dorr.
He added that Thursday's order was "typical of several hundred" that are issued each year, and was not considered a major safety issue.
The FAA said the cost to the industry would be about $60 a plane.
The order covers the 65 MD 11s registered in this country but not the 109 others around the world including Swissair's surviving models.
The agency said it did not know how many airlines had already done the work.
The FAA issued the order as a final rule, but said it would accept public comment for 45 days.
Investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the Swissair crash, which involved smoke in the cockpit and killed all 229 people aboard.
Swissair "did everything correctly" in installing a state of the art entertainment system switched off last month in the wake of the crash of Flight 111, the airline's chief executive said in an interview published Sunday.

Swissair is the only customer for the system, manufactured by Phoenix based Interactive Flight Technologies Inc.
The plane bound from New York to Geneva crashed Sept 2 off the coast of Nova Scotia, killing all 229 people on board.
The cause of the crash has yet to be determined.
SAN FRANCISCO In a recent move that indicated he has no intention of backing away from his company's aggressive business tactics, Microsoft Corp.'s chairman, Bill Gates, has proposed acquiring the software business behind 3Com Corp.'s popular Palm Pilot hand held computer, according to people who have been briefed on the discussions.
The offer, made in an August meeting with 3Com's chairman, Eric Benhamou, was not accepted by 3Com executives, those people say.
But certainly, Gates is said to have dangled an alluring kingmaker's deal: If 3Com were willing to sell off its software business, a market favorite compared with Microsoft's Windows CE operating system, Gates would make the company's remaining Palm Computing hardware business, "the Compaq Computer of the hand held market."
Officials of both companies declined to confirm or deny word of the meeting at Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., headquarters, at which the two executives discussed a variety of strategic possibilities between the two companies, according to several people privy to the discussions.
Though the proposal was unsuccessful, the approach provides graphic insight into Microsoft's business tactics.
As in its abortive 1995 deal to acquire the financial software maker Intuit, which was rejected not by Intuit but by the Justice Department, Microsoft is increasingly looking to buy its way into markets where its own products are not competitive enough to unseat established brands.
And the Palm Pilot offer would appear to indicate that Microsoft has not scaled back its ambitions in the face of the Justice Department's antitrust suit.
The antitrust suit, initiated last October, originally focused on Microsoft's linking of its Internet Explorer World Wide Web browser with the industry dominant Windows 95 operating system.
But more recently, the Justice Department has begun to examine a wide range of the company's business practices.
Negotiations to control development and production of the software that powers the most popular hand held computer, the Palm Pilot, are significant, analysts said, because hand held devices, from note taking aids to cellular telephones, are one part of the market where Microsoft does not appear to be quickly gaining ground.
The market is seen as growing more quickly than the computer industry over all.
"Maybe Bill Gates was trying to get rid of a competitor," said Andrew Seybold, a computer and communications analyst and publisher of his own newsletter, based in Boulder Creek, Calif. "I don't think the Windows CE products have slowed them down at all."
While Microsoft officials did not directly dispute word of the overture to 3Com, they rebutted suggestions that they had lost confidence in the Windows CE software.
"Any statement suggesting that Microsoft would license or buy the Palm software in lieu of Windows CE is flatly false," said Greg Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman.
"3Com is a great partner and we have frequent discussions with them," he added.
"But it would be inappropriate to comment on those discussions."
A spokeswoman for 3Com simply said the company would not comment on any of the discussions the company had held with Microsoft.
Though the two companies have had a broad set of partnerships in other areas of computing, they have been bitter enemies in the market for hand held computers.
Earlier this year, 3Com filed suit in Germany after Microsoft introduced a clone of the Palm Pilot, which it called the Palm PC.
Microsoft backed down, renaming its hand held unit the Palm sized PC.
The Palm Computing business of 3Com has shipped more than 1.5 million copies of its hand held device, making it the dominant player in the market for so called personal digital assistants after earlier efforts like Apple Computer Inc.'s Newton failed to gain broad acceptance.
By comparison, only about 750000 Windows CE based hand held systems have been shipped, according to Rob Enderle, an analyst at Giga Information Group in Santa Clara, Calif.
WASHINGTON The government's case against Microsoft is a narrative that revolves around Netscape Communications Corp. and the government's leading witness, James Barksdale, Netscape's 55 year old president and chief executive.
In his 127 pages of written testimony, released Monday afternoon, Barksdale supplied new details and a firsthand perspective of a disputed meeting between Microsoft and Netscape on June 21, 1995, at Netscape's offices in Mountain View, Calif.
At the meeting, the government contends, Microsoft executives proposed that the two companies divvy up the emerging market for software used to browse the Internet's World Wide Web.
Microsoft replies that the prosecutors are misinterpreting a routine business meeting.
A longtime executive who has worked for IBM, Federal Express and ATandT, Barksdale described the June 1995 meeting as anything but routine.
"I have never been in a meeting in my 35 year business career in which a competitor had so blatantly implied that we would either stop competing with it or the competitor would kill us," Barksdale stated.
"In all my years in business, I have never heard nor experienced such an explicit proposal to divide markets."
If the court accepts Barksdale's version of the meeting, it will represent a big victory for the Justice Department and the 20 states suing Microsoft.
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could rule that the meeting itself as a conspiracy to try to curb competition through collusion is an antitrust violation.
And the government's broader case begins with that meeting.
After Netscape spurned the offer, the government contends, Microsoft embarked on a strategy intended to thwart competition in the Internet software market by crushing Netscape, bundling its browser into its Windows operating system and making restrictive deals with personal computer makers, online services and other companies.
Those tactics, the government says, represented an unfair use of the market power Microsoft has as a result of its monopoly in operating system software for personal computers.
Microsoft, the government adds, used that power to protect its monopoly position and to extend its reach into the fast growing new markets for Internet software and electronic commerce.
The government focused on the June 1995 meeting in its antitrust suit, filed in May, and since then additional information about the meeting has been reported.
But in his lengthy statement, Barksdale provides, for the first time, a precise account of what he says occurred at the meeting.
He quotes what Microsoft executives said and refers to notes taken by another Netscape executive who attended the meeting, Marc Andreessen.
The two companies had held talks for months about cooperating.
By the June meeting, Barksdale said, the cooperation Netscape most sought was technical information from Microsoft that would enable Netscape's Navigator browser to run smoothly on top of Microsoft's industry standard Windows operating system.
At the meeting, Barksdale said, the Microsoft team, led by Dan Rosen, proposed that Netscape not market a browser for the Windows 95 operating system, which was shipped two months later.
As part of the proposal, Microsoft would also invest in Netscape and take a seat on the Netscape board.
Barksdale asked if Netscape's ability to obtain technical information from Microsoft was conditioned on Netscape's accepting the proposal.
Barksdale quotes Rosen as saying, "It certainly isn't independent."
Any technical information Netscape was seeking could be obtained, Barksdale quotes a Microsoft executive as saying, "depending on how we walk out of this room today."
If Netscape rejected Microsoft's deal, Barksdale testified, the Microsoft team told Netscape that it could expect the technical information to be delayed for three months meaning that the latest version of Netscape's browser would not be ready for the release of Windows 95.
After declining Microsoft's offer, Netscape did not obtain the necessary information until three months later, which Barksdale says was "precisely what Microsoft had threatened at the June 21 meeting."
These allegations concerning technical information are legally significant because they portray Microsoft as using the power from its operating system dominance to reward allies and to punish rivals something Microsoft has consistently maintained it does not do.
Andreessen, whose notes on his laptop computer are a vital piece of the government's evidence, is said by Barksdale to be an "extraordinarily fast typist" an aside clearly intended to deflect questions raised by Microsoft's lawyers about the credibility of the notes.
In his trial statement, Barksdale quoted these notes at length including Microsoft's effort to keep Netscape out of the Windows 95 market for the browser or "client" in computer jargon.
Typing all capital letters for emphasis, Andreessen wrote that Microsoft wanted to "OWN THE WIN95 CLIENT MARKET AND THAT NETSCAPE SHOULD STAY AWAY."
Demonstrating yet again the power of its franchise, the Microsoft Corp. Tuesday reported that its quarterly earnings had risen 58 percent over their level a year earlier, far exceeding Wall Street estimates.
Microsoft, the world's leading maker of computer software, said demand for the Windows 98 operating system exceeded its projections, particularly in Japan and Europe.
Microsoft's improved performance coincided with the beginning stages of a landmark antitrust trial in Washington that could threaten its dominance in computer software.
The company, which the Department of Justice has portrayed as a ruthless and unfair competitor, said its strength in the latest quarter was derived mostly from Windows 98, which was released just last June, and the Windows NT corporate operating system.
The results for Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., were released after the stock market had closed.
In NASDAQ trading, Microsoft shares closed at $100.25, down $2.69, which may have reflected the opening of the antitrust trial on Monday.
But in after hours trading, the shares traded as high as $103.75.
"Business is good, so the doom and gloom scenario of some economic prognosticators certainly hasn't come to pass," Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview.
"This is not just for Microsoft, but the whole PC industry."
Despite the widespread economic problems in much of the world, Maffei noted, the six largest software companies and eight largest computer and chip companies that have reported earnings have all beaten estimates.
While continuing to urge caution about the outlook, as Microsoft executives do each quarter, Maffei said the company was likely to do better than expected in the second fiscal quarter as well.
He said he would advise securities analysts to adjust their estimates upward.
For the quarter ended Sept 30, Microsoft earned $1.68 billion, or 62 cents a diluted share, more than twice the $663 million, or 25 cents a share, reported in the comparable period a year ago.
Revenues rose 26 percent, to $3.95 billion from $3.13 billion.
The latest results included a $160 million one time gain on the sale of Softimage, while in the comparable quarter last year the company took a previously announced $296 million write off related to the purchase of WebTV Networks Inc. Without these one time items, Microsoft's earnings rose to $1.52 billion, or 56 cents a share, compared to the previous year's $959 million, or 36 cents a share, to record the 58 percent gain.
Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp., which tracks earnings results, had expected Microsoft to earn 49 cents a share.
"It was a terrific quarter, a real blowout, a very pleasant surprise for Microsoft shareholders," said Rick Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman Sachs.
Microsoft's results "benefited from much higher margins," he said.
"We had a combination of better than expected revenues and lower than expected expenses in the quarter," he said.
Maffei said the improved profit margins were partly a seasonal phenomenon because the company does less hiring during the summer and the marketing costs associated with the launch of Windows 98 were largely in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1998.
Also, service costs are lower for Windows 98 than for Windows 95) "We had better than expected revenues, and we were at the low end of our spending," he said.
Although the antitrust suit brought against Microsoft by the United States Department of Justice did not affect earnings, Maffei said, it does have a direct cost in increased legal spending.
"That's a large cost, but not a material cost," he said.
"We do worry about the continued cost of the DOJ's image blasting."
Unearned revenue, the portion of sales Microsoft sets aside to reflect the long term deployment of many of its products, grew to $3.13 billion in the quarter, up $245 million from a year ago.
Cash and short term investments totaled $17.24 billion, compared with $13.93 billion a year ago.
On a cautionary note, Maffei said fallout from the Asian economic crisis remains a concern and the company is uncertain about future performance in Latin American countries.
Corporate spending for computer issues related to the year 2000 may divert revenues away from some Microsoft products but could benefit others, he said.
Following is the text of the first two sections of the Sherman Act, as passed by Congress in 1890.
As the foundation on which federal antitrust law has been built, the act has been amended several times elevating the crime to a felony, increasing the fines and prison terms for individuals and setting fines for corporations convicted of violating it.
In the case of Microsoft, the government has invoked the Sherman Act to file a civil suit that seeks to change the company's business practices, not a criminal suit that seeks financial penalties.
An Act to Protect Trade And Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints and Monopolies: Section 1.
Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal.
Every person who shall make any such contract or engage in any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.
Section 2.
Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade of commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.
WASHINGTON The New Economy is on trial here along with Microsoft Corp. Sure, the company is the one in the dock.
But the outcome of the case against Microsoft will establish the ground rules for how the doctrine of antitrust will apply to high technology fields like computer software.
And the software industry is seen as being at the forefront of new patterns of behavior by workers, companies and markets that define the New Economy.
In the New Economy, people live on Internet time and product cycles are measured in months, not years.
It is the slice of the economy driven by entrepreneurs, stock options and network effects.
Silicon Valley is its headquarters, with subsidiaries in Seattle, Austin and elsewhere.
It is the future, its proponents insist, coming to your home soon.
If Microsoft wins, the digital age will unfold as a free fire zone of let 'er rip capitalism, for better or worse.
If Microsoft loses, courts or the antitrust watchdogs may be getting their oars into such complex matters as product design, for better or worse.
Let the courts decide.
But for an analytic examination of struggle and competition at the edge of the New Economy today, a new book, "Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft" (The Free Press), offers some intriguing insights.
The book, written by Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, and David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School, was placed in evidence at the Microsoft trial last week.
In its defense, Microsoft points to passages in the book in which executives of Netscape Communications are quoted speaking candidly about their missteps.
Microsoft calls these statements proof that Netscape's travails in the Internet browser market were its own doing, not because Microsoft was acting like a nasty monopolist.
Yet the book as a whole reads as a coming of age account of the triumphs and setbacks of a fast moving Internet pioneer daring or foolish enough to take on the dominant company in computing.
Netscape's experience teaches as much about what hasn't changed as what has.
A fundamental lesson is that even revolutionary technologies take time to cause a revolution.
No matter how great the tail wind of hype and venture capital, the Next Big Thing takes time to change the practices and habits of companies and people.
"Netscape got too ambitious and too wedded to the belief that the Internet revolution would change everything tomorrow," Yoffie explained.
The threat Netscape posed to Microsoft was that its browser could serve as an alternative "platform" to Microsoft's Windows.
In other words, the browser could take the place of Windows as the first thing users see when they start their computers and as the departure point from which applications could be started.
But it takes a long time for a new computing platform to catch hold, as thousands of software programmers gradually become converts and write applications that work with the new platform.
By often and publicly declaring that it was going to challenge Microsoft head on, Netscape aroused the software giant, which trailed in Internet software.
"Netscape had the perfect Trojan horse," Yoffie said.
"But it woke up the enemy before it was entrenched."
As it matured, Netscape also found that while the speed of product development was important, so was traditional product quality.
Netscape's freewheeling "hacker culture" fostered flexibility and creativity one Netscape manager quoted in the book described its development style as "slightly out of control" but also led to buggy software, a nuisance that became problematic with more sales to quality conscious corporations.
In the last year or so, the authors note, Netscape has made strides in quality, hiring testers and increasing its use of automated testing software.
Netscape has increased its ratio of testers to developers from one to five to one to three, though it still trails Microsoft's one to one ratio.
"You can be fast and flexible in software development, but you have to pay the price in testing," Cusumano said.
Netscape's future is by no means assured.
But for all the talk at the trial about Microsoft trying to crush it, Netscape has done a good job of changing its strategy to avoid tackling Microsoft head on whenever possible.
What Netscape, the Internet pioneer, has learned setting aside the legal issues is precisely what the pioneers of the personal computer revolution learned.
They declared that their technology would change the world, but the process works in the other direction, too.
For a breakthrough technology to move into the mainstream, it must become more mainstream easier, more reliable and more useful for the workaday chores of the economy.
It does not change everything overnight.
WASHINGTON A lawyer for Microsoft Corp. on Thursday portrayed the company's competitor in the Internet software business, Netscape Communications Corp., as a willing and eager participant in deal making that culminated in a June 1995 meeting at which the government and Netscape now say that Microsoft illegally offered to divide the market.
That meeting and the charge of an illegal offer to divide the market for Internet browsers, the software used to navigate the World Wide Web, are central elements of the antitrust suit by the Justice Department and 20 states being heard in United States district court here.
Late in the day, the Justice Department made public an e mail that seemed to support elements of the government's account.
The memo, from Dan Rosen, a senior Microsoft executive who attended the meeting with Netscape's leaders, was written to Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, and others.
It summarizes the meeting and begins with a list of "Our goals going into the meeting, in priority order."
The first goal, the memo said, was to "establish Microsoft ownership" of the market for Web browsers that run on Windows computers.
In his third day cross examining James L. Barksdale, Netscape's president and chief executive, the Microsoft lawyer, John Warden, suggested that the market division allegation stemmed from anger on the part of Netscape executives when they learned at that meeting that Microsoft intended to bundle its own browser with its Windows operating system.
"Is there really anything going on here other than a difference of opinion between you and Microsoft on where the line is" between a browser and an operating system?
Warden asked.
At that Barksdale normally a calm and unerringly polite witness exploded: "We feel strongly that a browser is a separate application, and a manufacturer that controls 90 percent, plus, of the world's operating systems and pulls the browser into it has stepped across that line!"
"That's your objection?"
Warden asked.
"You disagree with them building it into the operating system?"
"I do, I do, I do," Barksdale said.
Among other charges, the government's suit accuses Microsoft of trying to persuade Netscape executives, at the meeting on June 21, 1995, to quit marketing browsers that run on Windows computers.
If they did not agree, the government says, Microsoft threatened to destroy Netscape.
Such a collusion to divide markets would be a violation of federal antitrust law.
When Netscape refused, the government further charges, Microsoft decided to bundle its own Web browser, Internet Explorer, with the Windows system to drive Netscape out of the browser business.
Windows runs more than 90 percent of all new personal computers.
In court Thursday, Microsoft presented memos and e mail messages suggesting that Netscape had eagerly sought the June meeting.
Barksdale acknowledged that he had written memos to other Netscape executives in early June 1995 in which he had enthusiastically reported that in an earlier meeting, Microsoft had shown an interest in investing in his company.
"No, they didn't do anything as rash as trying to buy us (yet) but they did suggest that they wanted to invest in us," Barksdale wrote to another employee three weeks before the meeting.
"It was a good session."
Another memo from Barksdale to several senior Netscape employees reported that Microsoft had been "very friendly, nonthreatening" and had congratulated Netscape on having "done a great job."
As Barksdale's e mail recounted it, the Microsoft executives had added, "How can we work together?
Discussion done with Bill's blessing," a reference to Gates.
With that as a prelude, Warden, Microsoft's lead counsel in the case, produced several other e mail messages and memos suggesting that Netscape and Microsoft had both plunged into planning for the June 21 meeting.
Warden used each to cast further doubt on the government's allegations.
One piece of documentary evidence indicating that Microsoft did propose dividing the browser market are notes that Marc Andreessen, a cofounder and executive vice president of Netscape, took on his laptop computer during the meeting.
A copy of those notes was released Thursday by the court.
Andreessen wrote that Microsoft had issued a "threat that Microsoft will own the Windows 95 client market, and that Netscape should stay away."
Another piece of evidence is the memo from Rosen to Gates, written the day after the meeting.
Rosen quotes another member of the Micrsoft team as telling the Netscape executives: "We need to understand if you will adopt our platform," Windows, "and build on top if it, or if you are going to compete with us."
The memo continued, "They understand that we are going to incorporate into the platform technology that they provide today."
The Microsoft executives, according to Rosen's memo, told Netscape's leaders that their intention was to "suck most of the functionality of the current Netscape browser" into Windows.
But Rosen's memo did not indicate that the Netscape executives had reacted negatively to this.
The memo was introduced into evidence Thursday, but not referred to in court.
In fact, summing up his conclusions after three days of testimony, Warden said, "I suggest to you, Barksdale, that if you look at the whole record of events leading up to June 21, the only fair conclusion that can be reached is that Andreessen imagined or invented the proposal to divide the markets, and that you and your company signed onto it in order to assist in this prosecution."
"I absolutely disagree with that," Barksdale retorted.
"It's absurd.
I was in the meeting.
I know what I know.
"I was there," he said.
"You weren't."
WASHINGTON After months of noisy prelude, the antitrust trial against the Microsoft Corp. opened in federal court Monday morning with a pointed personal attack on Bill Gates, the company's chairman, who testified in a taped deposition that he knew little if anything about the key charges leveled against his company by the Justice Department and 20 states.
"My only knowledge is the Wall Street Journal article, it surprised me" Gates said of reports of a meeting in which his company had offered its chief competitor in Internet software a chance to divide the market.
Gazing directly at his questioner, brow furrowed, head tilted slightly to the left, he added, "I was not involved" in discussions of the key meetings.
But as the Justice Department proceeded with its opening argument over the next two hours, its lead lawyer in the case, David Boies, presented more than a dozen memos and e mail messages written by Gates over the last three years, showing clearly that he and other senior Microsoft executives not only knew about the matters in question but had forcefully directed them.
Using memos and documents, the government portrayed a company obsessed with crushing its competitor, the Netscape Communications Corp., and willing to use every tool at its disposal, including threats and financial inducements, to force or persuade other companies to drop any planned or existing alliances with Netscape.
Gates told his questioner at another point in the deposition that he had not even read the government's antitrust suit.
As to its central charge, illegal collusion to divide software markets, Gates said only: "I think somebody said that was in there."
Gates also said that in 1995, "somebody came to me to ask if it made sense investing in Netscape."
Shaking his head dismissively, Gates recalled, "I said it didn't make any sense to me."
Moments later, Boies displayed on a 10 foot video screen and enlargement of a memo in which Gates wrote to Paul Meritz, a senior Microsoft executive, that over time Microsoft might have to compete with Netscape.
"But in the meantime we can help them," Gates wrote.
"We can pay them some money."
At the heart of this competition and central to the case are browsing programs used to navigate the Internet's World Wide Web.
Netscape got an early lead in the market with its Navigator browser.
What frightened Microsoft was that Navigator could also be used as a "platform," a layer of software on which other programs can run.
This is the main function of an operating system, a market in which Microsoft has a monopoly with its Windows family of operating systems.
Leaving the federal courthouse Monday afternoon, William H. Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president of law and government affairs, said that the government's opening presentation was "based entirely on loose and unreliable rhetoric and snippets that were not in any reliable context."
Microsoft will offer its own opening remarks on Tuesday.
"These are the same tired old allegations," Neukomb said.
"None of these snippets, none of this rhetoric even approaches proof of anti competitive conduct."
Earlier, however, Boies had told the judge, "It's competition on the merits that the antitrust laws foster.
But this is not a situation of competition on the merits.
This is a situation, I respectfully submit, your honor, of clear restraint of trade."
In one 1995 e mail message relating to Microsoft's effort to push Netscape out of the market for browsers that run on Windows computers, Gates wrote other Microsoft executives: "I think there is a very powerful deal we can make with Netscape.
I would really like to see something like this happen!!"
Other memos showed that Gates was continually and personally involved.
In an attempt to demonstrate a pattern of anticompetitive behavior, Boies led Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court through a chronology of memos and messages that seemed to show Microsoft threatening and cajoling other companies.
After a meeting with Gates in 1996, an executive with America Online, the nation's largest on line service, wrote to other executives in his company: "Gates delivered a characteristically blunt query: 'How much do we need to pay you to screw Netscape?
This is your lucky day."
In the summer of 1995, one memo showed, Gates wrote to Andrew Grove, chairman of the Intel Corp., and bluntly asked why the company was doing software research that might conflict with Micrsoft's plans.
"I don't understand why Intel funds a program that is against Windows," the message said.
An Intel note a few weeks later said, "Gates made vague threats about supporting" Intel's competitors, unless Intel agreed to shut down its software research.
Intel eventually relented, but while this standoff was underway, a Microsoft memo said, the nation's computer manufacturing industry was paralyzed while awaiting word on whether Microsoft deemed it acceptable to use certain features of a new computer chip Intel was selling.
Gates wrote: "This is good news.
It means they are listening to us."
In another case, the memos indicated that Microsoft threatened to stop selling the Apple Computer Co. a version of Microsoft's Office software suite, which holds more than 90 percent of that market unless Apple stopped supporting Netscape.
A central argument in the government's suit is that Microsoft has bundled its Web browser with Windows as a tactic in its war with Netscape.
For the last year, at least, Microsoft has argued that the browser was added to Windows only for the benefit of customers.
In court Monday, however, the Justice Department displayed numerous internal memos indicating that the bundling was indeed a tactical decision.
The memos showed that Microsoft's leaders first wanted to sell Interent Explorer and expected to earn $120 million a year from the sales.
Then, when the plan to push Netscape out of competition with Microsoft failed, the company's leaders decided to bundle the browser with Windows instead as a means of helping it gain a majority share of the market.
In one memo, written in December 1995 in the thick of Microsoft's effort to push Netscape out of the market Gates wrote a memo to others in the company acknowledging that Netscape was designing browser software "far better than we are."
In an interview a few months later, displayed in court Monday, Gates said: "Our business model works even if the Internet Explorer software is free.
We are still selling operating systems.
What's Netscape's business model look like in that case?
Not very good."
The government also proffered several memos from computer manufacturers complaining bitterly about Microsoft's licensing restriction that prohibited them from offering Netscape if they wanted to offer Windows.
"We're very disappointed," Hewlett Packard wrote to Microsoft last year.
"This will cause significant, costly problems.
From a consumer perspective, it is hurting our industry.
"If we had another choice of another supplier, based on your actions here, we would take it."
WASHINGTON Stinging from the government's opening statement, a defiant Microsoft Corp. forcefully defended its chairman, Bill Gates, in federal court on Tuesday, asserting that the no holds barred tactics of his company are not only common in the computer industry but also good for economy.
Microsoft's opening salvo in the sweeping antitrust suit was crafted as much for public opinion as for the court.
The company faces weeks of being portrayed as an alleged commercial predator in a highly publicized trial, which could badly tarnish Microsoft's reputation even if it wins.
The government's case, which opened on Monday in the U.S. District Court here, amounts to a litany of episodes of Microsoft's having used its market power to bully and bend competitors, business partners and corporate customers to its will.
On Tuesday, Microsoft's legal team sought to frame these episodes as part of rough and tumble capitalism.
While the way Microsoft does business may not be to everyone's liking, they suggested, it is certainly not illegal.
"The antitrust laws are not a code of civility in business," said John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer.
In his two hour opening statement, Warden angrily accused the government of trying to "demonize Bill Gates," whom he described as "a man whose vision and innovation have been at the core of the benefits that society is reaping from the information age."
The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft, Warden said, are misinterpreting routine business meetings in the computer industry as anticompetitive conspiracies.
The government's case focuses largely on the Internet software market and the business practices Microsoft used in its fight against the Netscape Communications Corp., the early leader in the browser software used to navigate the World Wide Web.
A key charge in the suit, for example, is that Microsoft prodded Netscape to illegally divide up the browser market in a June 1995 meeting a charge based mainly on the accounts of Netscape executives.
"Netscape's account of this meeting was fantastical," Warden said.
"None of the histrionics, shouting and table pounding occurred.
It's fantasy."
In Microsoft's view, the government's case is wrongheaded because it does not understand the computer industry, especially the necessity of cooperation among companies so that sophisticated technology products work with each other.
Just as the line between one software product and another often blurs, the company argues, so does the line between competition and cooperation, rivals in one area routinely cooperate in another.
Microsoft will attempt to cast doubt on several of the government's allegations by characterizing meetings as efforts at cooperation by companies that, understandably, do not always agree.
The government, for example, has alleged that Microsoft tried to pressure both the Intel Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. to back off Internet software efforts than conflicted with Microsoft's plans and to support Microsoft in the browser war.
"Those proposals and threats claimed by the government," Warden said, "will be shown by evidence to have been garden variety commercial discussions between companies developing complementary products.
They are of no antitrust consequence."
As the defendant, Microsoft does not have to prove that it behaved innocently or even ethically.
Instead, the role of Microsoft's legal team is to cast considerable doubt on the government's case both its specific allegations of bullying tactics and its broad theme that the economy and consumers are ultimately harmed by Microsoft's behavior.
In the afternoon court session, the Microsoft defense moved to the cross examination of the government's lead off witness, James Barksdale, the president and chief executive of Netscape.
To speed up the trial, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has ordered that direct testimony from witnesses for both sides must be submitted in writing beforehand.
So all the courtroom questioning of witnesses begins with cross examination.
With Barksdale on the stand, Microsoft's legal tactics soon became apparent.
Warden, a detailed, methodical interrogator, sought to portray Netscape as a Microsoft rival that went running to the Justice Department as a business tactic.
His questions also tried to lead Barksdale into admitting that all software makers are constantly adding new features to their products and that many companies have large shares of their markets without being branded a monopolist central themes of Microsoft's defense.
A lean, craggy 55 year old executive who speaks with the accent of his native Louisiana, Barksdale proved an elusive and often entertaining witness.
Warden asked Barksdale about the early years of his career when he worked as a salesman for the IBM Corp. from 1965 to 1972, years when IBM faced the kind of antitrust scrutiny Microsoft faces today.
Warden asked Barksdale if he believed the then dominant IBM was a monopolist.
"I don't know if I believed it," Barksdale replied, "but we were trained to behave as if we were a monopoly because we were operating under a consent decree," as Microsoft is today.
Warden then asked Barksdale if he did not believe that the dominant product of that day the IBM mainframe computer was not a so called bundled product of hardware and software that customers had to buy together.
The question relates to the current case because the government alleges that Microsoft's Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer browser are in fact two products bundled together for the purpose of forcing customers who want its industry standard operating system to also take its browser.
Microsoft says the browser is a feature of its Windows operating system, and thus a single product.
To the mainframe question, Barksdale replied that IBM mainframe hardware and software was sold as a bundle but that a 1968 consent decree forced IBM to also sell them separately very similar to the unbundling remedy that the government is seeking in the current Microsoft case.
"That forced unbundling gave rise to a whole new industry of hardware companies like Amdahl that made mainframe machines that run IBM mainframe software," Barksdale said.
To try to show that Netscape viewed a government suit as a competitive tactic, Warden repeatedly questioned Barksdale about his meetings with Justice Department officials including Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division.
Warden produced a document for presentation at a Netscape strategy meeting, titled the "Project Rocket Launch Plan."
At the meeting, held early this year, one of four items under the heading "The Situation" was "DOJ and court actions create opportunity for Netscape."
Warden then asked Barksdale whether he viewed a Justice Department suit as a "key" opportunity for his company.
Not a key one perhaps, Barksdale replied, but he did view a government antitrust suit against Microsoft as "a way of protecting an opportunity to keep the playing field open for Internet software."
SAN FRANCISCO In a recent move that indicated he has no intention of backing away from his company's aggressive business tactics, Microsoft Corp.'s chairman, Bill Gates, has proposed acquiring the software business behind 3Com Corp.'s popular Palm Pilot hand held computer, according to people who have been briefed on the discussions.
The offer, made in an August meeting with 3Com's chairman, Eric Benhamou, was not accepted by 3Com executives, those people say.
But certainly, Gates is said to have dangled an alluring kingmaker's deal: If 3Com were willing to sell off its software business, a market favorite compared with Microsoft's Windows CE operating system, Gates would make the company's remaining Palm Computing hardware business, "the Compaq Computer of the hand held market."
Officials of both companies declined to confirm or deny word of the meeting at Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., headquarters, at which the two executives discussed a variety of strategic possibilities between the two companies, according to several people privy to the discussions.
Though the proposal was unsuccessful, the approach provides graphic insight into Microsoft's business tactics.
As in its abortive 1995 deal to acquire the financial software maker Intuit, which was rejected not by Intuit but by the Justice Department, Microsoft is increasingly looking to buy its way into markets where its own products are not competitive enough to unseat established brands.
And the Palm Pilot offer would appear to indicate that Microsoft has not scaled back its ambitions in the face of the Justice Department's antitrust suit.
The antitrust suit, initiated last October, originally focused on Microsoft's linking of its Internet Explorer World Wide Web browser with the industry dominant Windows 95 operating system.
But more recently, the Justice Department has begun to examine a wide range of the company's business practices.
Negotiations to control development and production of the software that powers the most popular hand held computer, the Palm Pilot, are significant, analysts said, because hand held devices, from note taking aids to cellular telephones, are one part of the market where Microsoft does not appear to be quickly gaining ground.
The market is seen as growing more quickly than the computer industry over all.
"Maybe Bill Gates was trying to get rid of a competitor," said Andrew Seybold, a computer and communications analyst and publisher of his own newsletter, based in Boulder Creek, Calif. "I don't think the Windows CE products have slowed them down at all."
While Microsoft officials did not directly dispute word of the overture to 3Com, they rebutted suggestions that they had lost confidence in the Windows CE software.
"Any statement suggesting that Microsoft would license or buy the Palm software in lieu of Windows CE is flatly false," said Greg Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman.
"3Com is a great partner and we have frequent discussions with them," he added.
"But it would be inappropriate to comment on those discussions."
A spokeswoman for 3Com simply said the company would not comment on any of the discussions the company had held with Microsoft.
Though the two companies have had a broad set of partnerships in other areas of computing, they have been bitter enemies in the market for hand held computers.
Earlier this year, 3Com filed suit in Germany after Microsoft introduced a clone of the Palm Pilot, which it called the Palm PC.
Microsoft backed down, renaming its hand held unit the Palm sized PC.
The Palm Computing business of 3Com has shipped more than 1.5 million copies of its hand held device, making it the dominant player in the market for so called personal digital assistants after earlier efforts like Apple Computer Inc.'s Newton failed to gain broad acceptance.
By comparison, only about 750000 Windows CE based hand held systems have been shipped, according to Rob Enderle, an analyst at Giga Information Group in Santa Clara, Calif. NYT 10 18 98 1807EDT
WASHINGTON Attempting to refute a central allegation in the government's antitrust case, Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday produced a secret e mail message from the chairman of Netscape Communications Corp. seeking Microsoft's cooperation, offering to stay out of its way and suggesting that Microsoft invest in Netscape.
The e mail, written on Dec 29, 1994, was introduced to suggest that it was Netscape, not Microsoft, that initiated some of the elements of what the government portrays as an illegal offer by Microsoft in June 1995 to divide with Netscape the market for software used to browse the Internet's World Wide Web.
The e mail message, written by James Clark, the chairman and cofounder of Netscape, was submitted in court Wednesday by Microsoft as part of its defense in the sweeping antitrust suit filed by the Justice Department and 20 states.
It was perhaps the most surprising piece of evidence produced during a second day of often combative cross examination of the government's leading witness, James Barksdale, the president and chief executive of Netscape.
Throughout the morning and afternoon sessions, John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, frequently tried to goad Barksdale to concede key points in Microsoft's defense namely, that Netscape's browser is widely distributed despite Microsoft's allegedly unfair business practices, and that Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser only began gaining market share against Netscape's Navigator in the fall of 1996, because Explorer had been significantly improved, not because of predatory conduct on the part of Microsoft.
Barksdale made few concessions, repeatedly replying, "No, I don't agree."
In the e mail memo to Dan Rosen, a Microsoft executive, Clark wrote "We have never planned to compete with you."
Later, Clark wrote, "We want to make this company a success, but not at Microsoft's expense.
We'd like to work with you.
Working together could be in your self interest as well as ours.
Depending on the interest level, you might take an equity position in Netscape, with the ability to expand the position later."
Clark concluded his e mail appeal by noting, "No one in my organization knows about this message."
Barksdale said he did not know about the e mail until recently and that the first time he saw it was in court Wednesday.
He said that Clark told him about his December 1994 proposal to Microsoft this summer when Netscape executives were being deposed by Microsoft's legal team in preparation for the trial.
"He said that he made an offer to them including some of this and that it was rejected," Barksdale testified.
On the witness stand Wednesday, Barksdale sought to portray the December 1994 e mail from Clark as a freelance overture that did not represent corporate policy.
"He never discussed it with the board, and he never discussed it with me," Barksdale said.
Because Clark's offer was quickly dismissed by Microsoft, the government asserts that its introduction in court by Microsoft is mainly an effort by the defense to try to "change the facts and change the subject," in the words of David Boies, special trial counsel for the Justice Department.
The December 1994 e mail is not related, the government contends, to the June 1995 meeting in which the Justice Department says that Microsoft made its illegal offer.
According to the government, Microsoft offered to make an investment in Netscape and give Netscape's software developers crucial technical information about the Windows operating system if Netscape would agree not to make a browser for Windows 95 operating system, which Microsoft released two months later.
The government says Netscape rejected Microsoft's collusion pact, while Microsoft replies that the government is misrepresenting what was a routine business meeting.
Clark sent his e mail during Netscape's precarious startup phase, before the company had yet begun to garner a lot of sales and with Clark watching his $5 million investment in the company dwindle.
In his testimony, Barksdale tried to dismiss the memo as a sales ploy, perhaps made in desperation, as opposed to a genuine business plan for Netscape.
Warden asked Barksdale of Clark, "Do you regard him as a truthful man?"
After pausing, Barksdale replied, "I regard him as a salesman."
"I'm not going to touch that," Warden responded.
Microsoft also introduced a portion of Clark's pretrial deposition to try to prove that as early as the fall of 1994 Netscape was aware of Microsoft's intention to bundle its browser with its Windows operating system.
This is potentially significant because the government says that Microsoft's principal reason for folding the browser into the operating system was as an anticompetitive tactic to undermine Netscape.
In the fall of 1994, Microsoft asserts, Netscape had not yet produced its first product.
In his deposition, Clark testified that he first heard Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, talk of bundling the browser and the operating system at an industry conference in October 1994.
Clark was asked if he had a personal conversation with Gates about this, and Clark said no, instead recalling it as a vaguely threatening comment made to the conference audience.
"All he said was: I hope no one plans to make money on browsers because they will be bundled into the operating system," Clark said.
In his cross examination, Warden also tried to establish that Netscape had long viewed all but free distribution of its browser as part of its business plan.
This assertion relates to the case because Microsoft's decision to distribute its Internet Explorer browser free is characterized in the government's suit as one of several extraordinarily aggressive steps Microsoft took to try to undercut Netscape.
To make this point, Warden introduced as evidence portions of the manuscript from a new book, "Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft," by Michael Cusumano, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, and David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business school.
The book, based on extensive interviews with present and former Netscape executives, quotes Marc Andreessen, a cofounder and executive vice president, as describing browser marketing as "free but not free."
The concept refers to the notion that many individuals and corporations downloaded browser software from Netscape's Web site without paying for it.
Still, free distribution is valuable because it encourages companies to adopt Netscape's technology, and Netscape bases its business on selling large software packages for hub computers, or servers, that feed data to many personal computers in a network.
Warden raised the issue to suggest that Netscape's business model did not vary much from what Microsoft did.
When asked about it, Barksdale replied, "I have never heard this term 'free but not free.'
I have not heard it, I don't espouse that, and that was not our strategy."
ISTANBUL, Turkey A three week old crisis between Turkey and Syria appears to have been at least temporarily defused by the signing of an agreement in which Syria agreed to stop supporting Kurdish rebels, who are demanding a homeland in Turkey.
Turkey had demanded that Syria cease all support for the guerrilla force known as the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which is fighting for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey.
It also demanded that Syria expel the guerrillas' leader, Abdullah Ocalan.
According to a text made public by Turkish officials, the agreement stipulates that Syria "will not allow the PKK to receive military, logistic or financial support or to carry out propaganda on its soil."
Ocalan's current whereabouts are unclear.
He asserted in a telephone interview with journalists last week that he is "in Kurdistan," which could mean either southeastern Turkey or northern Iraq.
Other reports place him in Russia, Cyprus, Iran or Armenia.
Some say he remains in Damascus.
"He has been in a Moscow suburb for a week," Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz of Turkey said on Tuesday.
"We have taken serious initiatives for his extradition."
The Russian ambassador in Turkey, Alexander Lebedev, denied that Ocalan was in Russia.
Turkey set off the crisis this month by threatening to take military action against Syria if it did not stop supporting Kurdish rebels.
Officials from the two countries met on Monday and Tuesday in southeastern Turkey.
The agreement has not yet been officially announced in Syria, but Turkish officials said that it had been signed by a senior Syrian officer, Gen. Adnan Badr al Hassan, and that they assumed it represented Syria's official position.
"This document should be considered as an agreement which ends the crisis and starts dialogue," said Necati Uktan, a spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
"Syria extends its hand of friendship to us," Uktan said.
"If everything is realized on the framework of the agreement, we will then shake this hand.
If we consider the worst scenario and think that this will not be realized, our military measures will be enforced at this stage."
The two countries were brought together in part through the efforts of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
"We are pleased that we helped defuse the crisis between the two countries," Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said in Cairo Wednesday.
"All we care about is that both sides reach a settlement, which could certainly spare the region lots of tension."
Turkish officials had insisted that talks with Syria cover only the question of support for Kurdish insurgents.
They said they would not discuss Syria's grievances against Turkey, which include water issues and the status of Hatay Province, which is part of Turkey but claimed by Syria.
On Tuesday a Syrian television station broadcast a commentary asserting that Hatay "is an integral part of Syria and cannot be surrendered."
Foreign diplomats in Turkey who monitor developments in the Middle East said they would reserve judgment on the accord announced Wednesday.
"The Syrians have always said that they don't support the PKK and that Ocalan is not there," a diplomat said.
"So what they've promised doesn't really change much officially."
"The proof is in the pudding," said the diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
"Let's see how the Turks manage to pull off verification.
I don't expect them to go in bombing, but they're going to have to find a way to see if anything really changes in Syria."
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said his government would "carefully follow whether Syria is keeping and implementing these promises."
The leader of a 14 year old Kurdish insurgency, considered a terrorist by Turkey and its most wanted criminal, has been arrested in Rome, setting up a major battle with Italy over his extradition.
Abdullah Ocalan was arrested after stepping off a plane from Moscow, where he had sought asylum after recently fleeing his hideout in Syria, Turkish and Italian officials said Friday.
Ocalan leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
Nearly 37000 people have died in the conflict.
Italian officials said Ocalan was picked up on arrival Thursday night at Leonardo da Vinci airport in Rome because of an outstanding Turkish warrant.
"Once identified, the Italian government had the obligation to go ahead with his arrest given the serious charges against him," said Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.
Ocalan is on trial in absentia in Turkey on charges of leading a terrorist organization, threatening the country's territorial integrity and ordering killings, charges than can bring the death penalty.
Germany also issued an arrest warrant in January 1990 that accuses Ocalan of ordering the killing of PKK deserters and being the head of a terrorist organization.
Although there have been no executions in Turkey since 1984, Italy has consistently refused to extradite anyone if there was even a risk of capital punishment.
Luca Cosson, an official of Rome police, said that Ocalan flew to Rome from Moscow and was carrying a false passport.
Further checks revealed his identity, Cosson said.
Ocalan was held in a Rome prison, pending a hearing on Turkey's request for extradition.
No hearing date was immediately set.
Earlier reports said he was being treated in a hospital after complaining of feeling unwell.
In Turkey, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, who has been on the political ropes in a corruption scandal, hailed the arrest as evidence the government's crackdown on the rebels was succeeding.
"As a result of the pressure we have applied on Syria, our struggle against terrorism has reached a very positive stage," Yilmaz said.
He said he asked through Italy's ambassador to Ankara for Ocalan's extradition and that Turkey's envoy in Rome made the same request.
"As our NATO ally we do not believe that Italy would make the wrong decision," Yilmaz said.
It was unclear why Ocalan would travel to Italy, which is not known to be a hub for Turkish Kurdish rebels.
However, the so called Kurdish Parliament in exile was recently invited by Italian deputies to hold a session in the capital.
A Kurdish news agency said he would ask for political asylum in Italy, a call also taken up by leftist politicians in the Italian parliament, who asked their government to grant it.
Ocalan was reportedly forced to leave his hideout in Damascus following Turkey's threats to strike Syria.
Ankara claims Syria has long supported the rebels, offering them arms and refuge.
Of Marxist inspiration, the PKK was founded by Ocalan, a political science dropout from Ankara university in 1978.
Ocalan turned the group toward armed struggle in 1984, finding fertile ground among poor Kurds in the underdeveloped southeast.
The Turkish army claims it all but wiped out the PKK within Turkey, but the rebels have hideouts in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and the fighting continues.
Seven female members of a Kurdish group were on a three day hunger strike Tuesday in support of a controversial Kurdish leader, whom they claim is being persecuted.
The women, who began their protest Monday at the Freedom for the Women of Kurdistan building in the Armenian capital, were dancing, singing and watching Kurdish television on Tuesday.
The walls in the room were adorned with portraits of Abdullah Ocalan, who leads the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.
The group has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984.
"Fighting against imperialism, fascism and the colonial policy of Turkey, we are approaching the victory in the cause of liberation of our people," the women said in a statement.
Kurds elsewhere were also demonstrating in support of Ocalan, said the PKK leader in Armenia Mraz Khumoyan.
Ocalan has been labeled a terrorist by Turkey and the United States.
Turkish leaders say Ocalan is currently hiding in Russia, but Russian officials have refused to confirm that he is in the country.
Last week, Russia's parliament passed an appeal asking President Boris Yeltsin to offer political asylum to Ocalan.
Officials say Yeltsin is unlikely to heed parliament's appeal.
Russia's parliament on Wednesday asked President Boris Yeltsin to offer political asylum to Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is wanted in Turkey on charges of heading a terrorist organization.
Turkey officially asked Russia last week to extradite Ocalan, who leads the banned Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, which has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984.
The conflict has killed an estimated 37000 people.
Communist lawmaker Yuri Nikiforenko initiated the move seeking asylum for Ocalan.
"This man has done a lot for the Kurdish people," he said.
The State Duma, parliament's lower house, supported Nikiforenko's proposal by a unanimous vote.
Russia's Foreign Ministry last month condemned the Turkish government's raids against Kurdish rebels in Iraq and demanded that Turkey withdraw its troops.
Ocalan's whereabouts are unclear.
Turkey says he recently left Syria for Russia, but Russian officials have refused to confirm that he is in the country.
Turkish newspapers have said Ocalan was in hiding in a suburb 30 kilometers (18 miles) west of Moscow.
Ocalan issued a statement last month saying he was somewhere in the Kurdish regions that stretch over parts of Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria.
Abdullah Ocalan, leader of Kurdish insurgents who has been sought for years by Turkey, has been detained in Rome after stepping off a plane from Moscow, Turkish and Italian officials said Friday.
Necati Bilican, Turkey's police chief, said his country would do whatever necessary to extradite the rebel leader.
Ocalan leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
Nearly 37000 people have died in the conflict.
Turkey considers the group a terrorist organization.
Italian officials said Ocalan was picked up on arrival Thursday night at Leonardo da Vinci airport in Rome.
Ocalan is wanted under an international arrest warrant, according to Turkish authorities.
He is on trial in Turkey in absentia on charges of leading a terrorist organization, threatening the country's territorial integrity and ordering killings, charges than can bring the death penalty.
Germany also issued an arrest warrant in January 1990 that accuses Ocalan of ordering the killing of PKK deserters and being the head of a terrorist organization.
Turkey's Anatolia news agency said its envoy in Rome was making an immediate extradition request, but it could run into difficulties.
Although there have been no executions in Turkey since 1984, Italy has consistently refused to extradite anyone if there was even a risk of capital punishment.
Luca Cosson, an official of Rome police, said that Ocalan flew to Rome from Moscow and was carrying a false passport.
They then made further checks and discovered his identity, Cosson said.
Claiming he was not feeling well, Ocalan asked to be taken to a hospital, the Italian official said.

Ocalan had officially requested asylum, Interfax reported.
"This man has done a lot for the Kurdish people," Nikiforenko said.
The Duma supported Nikiforenko's proposal by a unanimous vote.
Russia's Foreign Ministry last month condemned the Turkish government's raids against Kurdish rebels in Iraq and demanded that Turkey withdraw its troops.
In his letter to the Duma, Ocalan accused the Turkish government of trying "to annihilate the leadership of the Kurdish Workers Party, drown in blood the national liberation struggle by the Kurdish people and thus pave the way for their control of the entire Middle East."
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit criticized the Duma vote, and said he hoped President Boris Yeltsin would 'take on a realistic and constructive approach."
"Instead of forging ties with a terrorist organization like the PKK, (Russia) should keep good relations with a country like Turkey," Ecevit told reporters in Ankara, the Turkish capital.
Ocalan's whereabouts are unclear.
Turkey says he recently left Syria for Russia, but Russian officials have refused to confirm that he is in the country.

The foreign ministry on Friday protested the invitation by 109 Greek deputies to a Kurdish rebel leader to visit Greece.
In a statement, the ministry said that the invitation "would only encourage terrorist activities."
"We strongly protest the action of the Greek parliamentarians and await the Greek government decision to clarify its position toward this invitation," the statement read.
The open invitation to Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Worker's Party, was issued Thursday.
Turkey has in the past accused Greece of harboring and training Kurdish rebels who have been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast since 1984.
Close to 37000 people have died in the conflict.
Greece denies the charges, though the group's political wing has an office in Athens.
Turkey and Greece are at odds over numerous issues, including the division of Cyprus and territorial disputes in the Aegean.
Turkish officials claim that Ocalan is currently hiding in Russia.
About 100 Kurds began a hunger strike in the main square of Nicosia on Saturday to protest the detention in Italy of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
Men and women wearing white shrouds danced to Kurdish music blared through loudspeakers beneath the Venetian walls of the old city.
Several hundred Kurdish refugees have fled their homeland for this Mediterranean island nations.
Red and gold flags of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party of Turkey, known as the PKK, fluttered over huge cloth banners with slogans in English and Greek calling for Ocalan's release.
Ocalan is the leader of the PKK which has been waging an rebellion in southeast Turkey for the past 14 years in a demand for autonomy.
Turkey has branded him a terrorist, holding him responsible for nearly 37000 deaths in the conflict.
Italy announced that Ocalan was arrested on arrival at Rome's airport Thursday on the basis of an outstanding Turkish warrant.
The protesters distributed pamphlets by the National Liberation Front of Kurdistan, the PKK's political wing.
These quoted Ocalan as saying he flew to Rome with the knowledge of the Italian government.
He was further quoted as saying that "necessary procedures are under way so that I can remain in this country (Italy) in my political capacity.
But it is too early to say anything positive or negative on developments.
"I call on our people, our friends and the entire international community to watch developments closely."
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Wednesday Turkey was remaining cautious towards neighboring Syria despite a deal with Damascus to crack down on a Kurdish rebel group.
Turkey and Syria stuck the deal Tuesday, ending a weeks long standoff.
Under the deal, Syria agreed to brand the Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, a "terrorist" group and to clamp down its activity in Syria.
"These results are very important," Cem told a group of businessmen.
"But we have to be careful about their applications.
We shall be observing developments with caution."
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan had left Syria for Russia, which would be a sign Damascus was meeting Turkish demands.
Sabah newspaper he was hiding in Odintsovo, 30 kilometers (18 miles) west of Moscow.
Russian officials, however, said they had no information on Ocalan entering Russia.
Ocalan's PKK has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey since 1984 in a war that has claimed 37000 lives.
For 11 days last month, Hurricane Georges plowed across the Caribbean, killing at least 500 people and inflicting property damage estimated at more than $5 billion as it weaved through nearly a dozen countries before expiring as an early fall rainstorm over Georgia.
It was a disaster although not for the entire region and not necessarily for the tourist industry on which the area's economy depends.
In other words, damage, though extensive, was selective.
Indeed, the majority of Caribbean islands were not affected at all by the storm and its winds, which reached a peak of 135 miles an hour.
Georges may have inflicted widespread destruction throughout the Greater Antilles, but "most of our 32 member states were untouched," said Jean Holder, secretary general of the Caribbean Tourism Organization.
"So over all, our position, as usual, is a good one, and we want the traveling public to be in no doubt as to that situation."
The entire Windward Islands group of the Eastern Caribbean, for example, was bypassed by the storm, meaning that visitors thinking of traveling to Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, the Grenadines, Martinique, St. Lucia or St. Vincent have no reason to change plans.
Similarly, Trinidad and Tobago, the Dutch islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao and Margarita Island just off Venezuela were all outside the hurricane zone.
The Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Jamaica and the Turks and Caicos Islands also were not affected by Georges.
Even on the larger islands that suffered a direct hit, such as Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, many important tourist destinations were spared.
Though parts of the southeastern Dominican Republic were severely damaged, for instance, and will not return to full normal operations for weeks, all of the hotels, restaurants and attractions in popular northern coast towns such as Puerto Plata are reported to be functioning normally.
So, as always, it is advisable to check with travel agents, hotel chains and national tourist offices about conditions at specific locales and properties.
Though hotels were the section of the tourism infrastructure that proved most vulnerable to Georges' depredations, as is clear in the country by country assessment below, the storm also forced the closing of several major airports, including the regional hub in San Juan.
But at American Airlines, the principal carrier in the region, and its affiliate, American Eagle, Caribbean service is pretty much back to normal, said Al Becker, a company spokesman, except for La Romana, in the eastern Dominican Republic.
There, he said, regular daily jet flights from Miami are not scheduled to resume until December, though prop service from San Juan has been restored.
According to airline and tourism officials, a few other airports remained available on a limited basis into October because, for instance, damage to landing towers, radar equipment or runway lights prevents after dark landings.
Mayaguez, in Puerto Rico, and St. Croix, in the United States Virgin Islands, fell into that category, but have now returned to normal operations.
In St. Kitts, where an extensive renovation and expansion of Robert L. Bradshaw International Airport had been completed just weeks before the storm struck, restrictions are still in force.
"That is God's hand," Dwyer Astaphan, minister of tourism for St. Kitts and Nevis, said resignedly early this month.
"We received damage to the tower and also to our terminal, but procurement is in process right now, and there is no reason why we cannot be completely finished with repairs by Dec 1."
Cruise lines, on the other hand, say they were virtually unaffected.
Many vessels were still on summer routes in the Mediterranean and Alaska when Georges was ripping through, and will be returning to the Caribbean only this month.
"The only place we really ran into problems was Key West," said Rich Steck, a spokesman for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, "and since they really have got their hands full now and are closed to tourism anyway, we are going to be substituting other destinations, such as Nassau, until things are under better control there."
In addition, one pier at the harbor in San Juan, which is second only to South Florida as a home port for cruise ships, suffered damage, according to officials of the Puerto Rican government.
But that has caused no inconvenience because "we have enough other docks to receive cruises" at the main harbor, said Jorge Davila, executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Co.
The damage at Port Zante in St. Kitts, opened in 1997, was somewhat more serious, officials there said, but not enough to require cancellation of cruises.
"The first cruise ship to come in was on Oct 8, a Norwegian Cruise Line Vessel with a capacity of 1534 passengers," Astaphan said.
Those returning vessels are tying up not at Port Zante but at old piers nearby.
"I am advised they will be replaced within three to five months," he said.
"In the interim, vessels with up to 1600 passengers can tie up at the old pier, which is where they tied up previously."
On islands that bore the brunt of the storm, beaches, tropical forests, golf courses and nature reserves were also damaged.
So even though hotels in the affected areas may be functioning again, the landscape may not appear as lush as it normally does, and some visitors may therefore wish to postpone trips.
On the other hand, tourism authorities on several islands say they may institute cut rate packages this winter to lure back reluctant travelers.
In addition, damage to fields and crops on several islands means that some food items may be unavailable at hotels or considerably more expensive.
In the end, then, whether or not to go to the Caribbean during the coming high season is largely a matter of individual preference.
A survey of the most affected islands follows, adhering to the same northwesterly course as the hurricane: ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA Most of the destruction in this nation involved residences: Officials estimate that more than half of all homes suffered some damage.
But at least half of Antigua's 28 main hotels were also affected.
Most are back in business, but the Caribbean Hotel Association reports that several do not plan to reopen until December.
Among them are the Pineapple Beach Club, the Inn at English Harbor, Coco Point Lodge, the Galleon Beach Club and the Hawksbill Beach Resort.
ST. KITTS and NEVIS Both of the islands that make up the smallest country in the Caribbean were struck with considerable force, which damaged residences and government buildings.
"Every area was impacted, some more than others," Astaphan said.
Government officials estimate that 85 percent of homes suffered some damage, most of it to roofs, and put preliminary estimates of repairs at nearly $500 million.
On Nevis, the smaller of the pair, many of the elegant plantation homes that attract upscale visitors have recovered quickly.
But the island's main resort, the Four Seasons, is not expected to reopen until Dec 15, due in part to beach erosion.
Nearly half the buildings at the Hurricane Cove Bungalows are said to have been leveled, but the hotel remains open.
Both the Fort Thomas Hotel and Jack Tar Village Resort and Casino on St. Kitts are closed.
Officials said the Fort Thomas probably will not open this season and that the Jack Tar, the biggest property on the island, is likely to remain closed until May.
NETHERLANDS ANTILLES On St. Maarten, Princess Juliana Airport remained open throughout the storm, an indication that the island was pummeled by less than full force winds.
Almost all of the 19 hotels and condominiums are said to have full power, water and telephone service, although some residential areas were still without electricity early in October, and the Millennium Beach Resort and Maho Beach Hotel and Casino are expected to be closed at least until December.
Nearby, tiny St. Eustatius was hard hit by the storm.
As a result, one sixth of the island's homes lost roofs, residents were still being advised to boil water as of mid October, and extensive damage to natural foliage was reported.
Hotels and restaurants, however, are fully operational.
UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS Early reports of widespread damage on all three main islands have proved exaggerated.
Such well known destinations as Caneel Bay on St. John, the Buccaneer on St. Croix and the Ritz Carlton on St. Thomas briefly stopped taking guests and reservations, but returned to normal after a quick cleanup.
Airline service is normal and all attractions are open.
PUERTO RICO By official tally, more than $2 billion in damages was inflicted to property across the island.
In the San Juan area, several hotels suffered significant damage and, according to the Caribbean Hotel Association, remain closed for repairs, among them the Condado Plaza, Crowne Plaza, Ramada Hotel Condado and Radisson Normandie.
Farther away, the hotels most seriously affected appeared to be the Hyatt Dorado Beach, which tourism officials expect will reopen Nov 9, and the Hyatt Regency Cerromar, whose tentative reopening date is Dec 15.
The most significant problem in the wake of the storm was the lack of electricity.
An extraordinarily high level of preparedness mitigated some of the havoc caused by Georges on other islands, but could not prevent damage to power lines and generators.
Telephone service was restored almost immediately, water supplies returned shortly afterward.
"By Oct 25, we expect that complete electrical service will pretty much be restored in metropolitan San Juan," said Davila of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company.
But, he added, it may take a little bit longer in the central mountains, where some paradores, or inns, are.
The luxury Horned Dorset Primavera Hotel, in Rincon, suffered no structural damage, but was closed until Oct 8 because it had no utilities.
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC The highest human toll, more than 280 dead and at least 100000 homeless according to official estimates, was inflicted here, and the country remains in a state of shock and mourning.
Also, the government has come under fire for its alleged lack of preparedness, and the population has complained about slow restoration of public services, electricity in particular.
The most severe damage to tourist facilities was concentrated in the east, around La Romana and Punta Cana.
The area's best known resort, Casa de Campo, is one of several hotels still closed, though a reopening date of Dec 20 has been set for "a limited inventory" of the hotel's 300 rooms and 150 villas.
The Allegro Resort Bavaro and the Viva Dominicus expect to be fully operational by mid November, but the Casa del Mar is scheduled to remain closed until Dec 1, and officials say the Allegro Resort Caribbean Village Decameron should be able to resume operations by Christmas.
HAITI The tourist infrastructure in the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation is so ramshackle even under ordinary circumstances that it has been hard to detect Georges' impact.
Hotels in Port au Prince, the capital, were suffering frequent power failures and breakdowns in telephone service in mid October, a normal state of affairs there.
Georges appears to have done its most severe damage in the Artibonite Valley, far off the tourist track.
Royal Caribbean canceled at least one cruise to Labadie, on the north coast, but that was because of reports of civil unrest, not hurricane damage, said Steck, of Royal Caribbean.
CUBA It is off limits to American tourists, but still draws more than one million visitors a year from other countries.
According to reports from Havana, hotels there were affected only marginally.
Some hotels in northern coastal resorts such as Cayo Coco, however, reported to have suffered some damage, but have now reopened.
Searchers recovered more bodies over the weekend from tons of gravel deposited by storm flooding in a southeastern Haitian town, pushing the national death toll from Hurricane Georges past 150, officials said Monday.
Seventeen bodies were recovered in Fonds Verrettes, a mountain town 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Port au Prince, bringing the town's death toll to 102, said Rep Francois Sanozier, who represents the area.
Earlier, officials said at least 85 people were killed in Fonds Verrettes, population 27000.
The nationwide death toll of at least 150 people was released before the 17 new victims of the Sept 23 floods were recovered.
In all, Georges killed at least 430 people throughout the Caribbean.
Forty years ago, Fonds Verrettes flourished at the foot of wooded mountains, but farm incomes fell and impoverished peasants cut down trees to make charcoal.
With no forest cover to absorb Georges' torrential rains, storm runoff crashed through the town, destroying dozens of homes and buildings.
"We asked the government to build drainage canals.
But nothing was done.
Now it is too late," said Fonds Verrettes Mayor Nelson Frankel.
An Interior Ministry spokesman, Phares Pierre, told Radio Haiti Inter on Monday that the central government had decided to relocate the town out of harm's way, but gave no further details.
A government delegation brought rice, sugar, beans and water for hurricane victims on Saturday, and more aid was expected this week.
NATIONAL FORECAST Frost will cover patches of the landscape from the western Great Lakes to the northern Ohio Valley on Friday morning.
High pressure stretching from Manitoba to West Virginia will promote mainly sunny, but very cool conditions in the Northeast quarter of the nation, with afternoon temperatures mostly in the 50s and 60s.
A pool of very cold air at 15000 feet over western New England will cause clouds and a few showers to develop in the hilly terrain.
Brisk breezes from the northwest will gust over 25 miles an hour in the Northeast.
Drier and cooler air will circulate into the Southeast behind a stalled front in the Gulf states.
A few thundershowers will attend the front in northern Florida and southern Georgia.
High pressure in the central Gulf of Mexico will direct very warm and humid air into the southern Plains and lower Mississippi Valley.
As sultry air pushes northward into the Plains, it will be further lifted by a strong jet stream disturbance over Nebraska and the result will be widespread clouds and showers.
A cold rain will dampen the lower Missouri Valley with showers developing farther north.
Several strong thunderstorms may form in west central Texas.
A wedge of warm, dry air will cover the Southwest.
More chilly, moist air will sweep into the Northwest behind a strengthening cold front in the northern Rockies.
Showers will fall from the Cascades to the coast.
Gusty winds will accompany showers in the Bitterroots.
The central Rockies should notice increasing clouds as the front approaches.
Focus: Triple Tropical Team Rainfall at Mobile, Ala., totaled 24.12 inches in last month, marking the city's wettest September on record.
The previous mark for September rainfall was 15.5 inches, set in 1913.
Moreover, September's total was 18.21 inches above the average for the month.
Such inflated rainfalls along the Gulf Coast in September can only occur when tropical systems are involved.
During September, the tropical trio of Hurricane Georges, Hurricane Earl and Tropical Storm Hermine each dumped substantial rains on Mobile, boosting last month's total to its highest total in 85 years.
It plowed over and past 17 Caribbean islands, crashing into the lives of more than 30 million people.
As each island fell prey to Hurricane Georges' battering winds, the casualties mounted.
They are mounting still.
And as they do, island nations are coming to grips with lost harvests, wrecked government buildings, lost tourist income and sudden populations of newly homeless.
Many past hurricanes damaged only a few islands.
Repairs were often quick.
Georges was different.
It swept past island after island in the northern Caribbean, causing billions of dollars in destruction and killing at least 400 people.
In some nations, like tiny St. Kitts, Georges ruined the crucial winter tourism season and sugar crop on which the islanders stake their lives.
In the Dominican Republic, the immediate concern is survival.
More than a week after Georges' 110 mph (177 kph) winds hit, searchers were still looking for survivors in towns swamped by flooding, or combing through deep muck in the grim task of finding the dead.
The numbers of homeless are staggering: More than 100000 in the Dominican Republic, 18000 and counting in Haiti, at least 17000 in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, and 3000 in St. Kitts a tenth of that island's population.
Along with shelter, the refugees need food, water, ice, clothing needs that have overwhelmed the region's small economies and taxed the disaster response capabilities of the United States, France and other donor nations.
Damage to popular hotels like Puerto Rico's bluff top El Conquistador Resort, and splintered windows in oceanfront condominiums, underscore a physical and economic vulnerability that the Caribbean's people know but would rather forget.
There was a surprise bright spot: The U.S. Virgin Islands battered by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and 1995's Marilyn, which destroyed 80 percent of the homes on St. Thomas emerged relatively unscathed despite being in Georges' path.
"It's a miracle," crowed Elizabeth Armstrong, general manager of the Buccaneer Hotel on St. Croix.
Still, Armstrong worries tourists will be scared away from the Virgin Islands by Georges' rampage elsewhere.
"It was such a big storm that I'm afraid people will believe the whole Caribbean was damaged," Armstrong said.
Much of it was.
Airline service and shipping were disrupted.
Entire islands plunged into darkness including Puerto Rico and its 4 million people and thousands of businesses closed.
The storm's economic cost has yet to be calculated.
In Puerto Rico alone, property damage has surpassed dlrs 2 billion.
Without power, food spoiled in refrigerators, and fights broke out in hours long ice lines.
Beneath a canopy of suddenly bright stars over San Juan, candles flickered in windows and drivers negotiated streets made unfamiliar by fallen trees and the enveloping dark.
Given the Caribbean's dependence on tourism it earns dlrs 14 billion a year and employs half a million people promoters are emphasizing the rapid rebuilding in such places as Puerto Rico and Antigua.
And they note that in the Windward Islands in the southeastern Caribbean and in Jamaica, it is business as usual.
In San Juan, giant white cruise ships, their lights blazing across San Juan Bay, have resumed their weekly visits.
Spectacular pink and purple sunsets have returned, a dramatic backdrop to the committed navy of surfers and boogie boarders riding the waves off Condado beach.
Old San Juan's blue cobblestone streets are bustling again with strollers and shoppers.
Still, Antigua, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and St. Kitts could lose tourism in coming months, said Michael Spinks of the Barbados based Caribbean Tourism Organization.
Last year, more than 1.7 million non cruise tourists visited the Dominican Republic, and Cuba and Puerto Rico welcomed more than 1.1 million each.
St. Kitts and Nevis earned more than dlrs 25 million from tourists.
MANAGUA, Nicaragua A natural disaster as terrible as Hurricane Mitch, which killed more than 10000 people in Central America in the past two weeks and left nearly 1 million more homeless, teaches a lot about the way a society does or does not work.
Some institutions and individuals rise to the occasion, others topple like palm trees in the wind.
But the nations of the region always seem to respond in ways that illuminate their history and character.
Nicaragua, for instance, is still grappling with many of the same problems it could not resolve in the 1980s, when the Sandinista National Liberation Front was trying to fend off U.S. backed Contra rebels in a bloody civil war.
In that polarized political climate, the relief effort here last week was hampered by petty partisan squabbling, the conservative government and the Sandinistas, who are now in opposition, even disagreed over whether it would be more appropriate to declare a "national disaster" or a "state of emergency."
As people in Posoltega, where more than 1500 people died in mudslides, waited for help alongside other devastated towns, the two camps jockeyed for control of the distribution of food and medicine and the political benefits to come with that.
By late in the week, with popular discontent rising, the damage caused by the partisanship seemed to impress even some politicians.
President Arnoldo Aleman said he would cede the supervision of relief activities to the Roman Catholic Church, while Gen. Joaquin Cuadra, the Sandinista who commands the armed forces, belatedly called for national unity.
Another recent storm, Hurricane Georges, provided insights that are at least as striking in September.
Faced with the threat of 135 mile per hour winds, three Caribbean island societies that have adopted radically different social and political models, even though they were all once Spanish colonies, responded in conspicuously different ways.
In Puerto Rico, a U.S. possession, the government leaped into action as soon as the first hurricane watch was issued.
Television stations repeatedly broadcast warnings to stay indoors and put up hurricane shutters, provided advice on stockpiling food and water and showed footage of past storms to remind the island's 3.5 million residents of what they might face.
As soon as Georges passed, utility repair crews were out restoring service and federal Emergency Management Agency teams were preparing reports and sending money.
Next door in the Dominican Republic, disorganization was the watchword.
Newspapers there have complained that the civil defense chief, Elpidio Baez, failed to issue storm warnings because he did not want to alarm people.
He denies that, but television and radio stations continued to broadcast soap operas and merengue competitions until just before the storm struck.
Some people who went to hurricane shelters found them closed and were turned away by soldiers.
There are even reports that officials opened a dam on the verge of buckling without advising residents living downstream, some of whom later drowned.
The government denies those accounts, but an official of the U.S. Agency for International Development said it was clear that overall, "when the thing hit, they were totally unprepared to respond."
The hurricane then moved on to Cuba, which, true to form for a militarized totalitarian state, responded as if the storm were an enemy to be vanquished.
President Fidel Castro instructed residents of affected zones to evacuate, an order that was enforced by the military and local security watchdogs and may have saved many lives.
Afterward, the Communist Party newspaper Granma praised Cubans for their "revolutionary discipline" and successful "combat" against Georges, whose "destructive force" amounted to "a kind of invasion."
Throughout the Caribbean basin, though, there is also a common thread.
Just as it seems that hurricanes striking the United States inevitably gravitate toward trailer parks, here the poorest are also the most vulnerable and seem to suffer the most, regardless of who governs.
"We've lived through earthquakes, a pair of civil wars, volcanic eruptions, tidal waves and now this, all in the last 25 years," said Maria Lourdes Rodriguez, a peasant who lives north of here.
"When is God going to take pity on us?"
At a shelter in Puerto Rico last week, Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke of a dlrs 39 million dollar U.S. grant to rebuild hurricane ravaged homes.
But two weeks after Hurricane Georges pummeled this U.S. territory, thousands still languish in schools, community centers and the homes of family and friends and her pledge looks like a drop in the bucket.
The cost of getting the homeless into homes will be far greater than virtually anyone had imagined, probably well beyond dlrs 1 billion.
And U.S. taxpayers are sure to foot most of the bill.
Officials originally estimated overall property damage to the island including roads, public buildings, parks, beaches at dlrs 2 billion, a figure now believed to be underestimated.
So far, the effort to solve the homeless crisis has been accompanied by confusion.
Officials still don't know how many homeless there are or how to give them homes.
Aside from killing three people on the island, Georges destroyed nearly 30000 houses and damaged at least another 60000, the local Housing Department estimates.
Those left homeless can receive up to dlrs 25000 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as well as dlrs 13500 to buy new appliances and furniture.
Puerto Rico authorities now say the FEMA program, which would allow residents to rebuild their wood and zinc homes, may be ill advised because it will leave new homes as vulnerable to hurricanes as the old ones.
Gov. Pedro Rosello instead wants federal block grants that, combined with money from Puerto Rico's local budget, would subsidize more expensive cement homes located out of harm's way.
Under his plan, hurricane victims would purchase houses worth dlrs 65000 for dlrs 15000, with mortgage payments of about dlrs 100 per month.
"Even though this has been a disaster for Puerto Rico, we should look at this as an opportunity to build something better than what we had before," explained Puerto Rico's Housing Secretary, Ana Carmen Alemany.
The plan was presented to Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo when he arrived in Puerto Rico last week with Mrs Clinton.
"We are banking on having Secretary Cuomo going back to President Clinton and (FEMA director) James Lee Witt and expressing to them support for this program," Alemany said.
In the meantime, 15000 Puerto Rican hurricane victims remain holed up in shelters.
More are staying with friends and relatives, though no one knows exactly how many.
Concrete decisions on solving their longterm plight have taken a back seat to the immediate need to restore water and electricity and provide temporary shelter.
"As of now, there is no program yet," admitted Bessie Figueroa, the Puerto Rico Housing Department's liaison to FEMA.
San Juan Mayor Sila Calderon said most of Georges' homeless represent "the other face of Puerto Rico": unwed mothers, welfare recipients, the unemployed, those in homes most vulnerable to disaster.
"These are people who are still waiting to participate in the development we've had over the past 50 years," she said.
Haiti has only dlrs 23 million to rebuild roads, bridges and irrigation canals destroyed by Hurricane Georges, less than half of what is needed for just the hardest hit areas, the government says.
Even before the storm caused floods and mudslides that killed 221 people, Haiti, the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, was a disaster zone.
The U.N. Human Development Index ranked the Caribbean nation No. 159 out of 174 countries in terms of income, life expectancy and education level.
About 700 million gourdes (dlrs 43.8 million) is needed to rebuild after the Sept 23 hurricane, Finance and Economics Minister Fred Joseph said at a news conference Friday.
He said that would cover only the worst hit areas.
The United States has pledged 210 million gourdes (dlrs 13.1 million) and the Washington based Inter American Development Bank 132 million gourdes (dlrs 8.3 million) in emergency aid for infrastructure.
Haiti's cash strapped government embroiled in a political power struggle for 1 1/2 years that has stalled millions of dollars in foreign aid can contribute only 25 million gourdes (dlrs 1.6 million), Joseph said.
The U.N. Development Program donated dlrs 100000 and Taiwan dlrs 300000.
Canada, Germany, Japan, and Spain donated additional hundreds of thousands of dollars.
France, Haiti's former colonizer, sent specialists to help purify water and treat the injured.
In addition, dozens of tons of material have been flown in from private international sources to help hurricane victims.
In his estimate, Joseph did not even mention the cost of rebuilding thousands of homes ripped apart by the storm and more than 56000 head of livestock killed.
Most Haitian deaths were blamed on flooding and mudslides in rural, mountainous areas.
A flash flood nearly destroyed the southeastern border town of Fonds Verrettes, where 102 people died.
For generations, Haitian peasants have cut down trees to make charcoal, denuding mountains left incapable of absorbing rainfall.
In economic terms, the hardest hit was the central Artibonite Valley, which is Haiti's bread basket.
Filled to overflowing by torrential rainfall, the Lake Peligre hydroelectric dam there threatened to burst.
The floodgates were opened, and a terrestrial tidal wave covered hundreds of thousands of acres (hectares) of farmland.
Economists predict a sharp rise in the cost of living since rice and beans, Haiti's staples, will have to be imported in greater quantities.
Earlier this month, Joseph estimated agricultural damage alone at more than dlrs 300 million.
Things could have been worse.
Georges flirted with catastrophic 150 mph (240 kph) winds over the Atlantic, but entered the Caribbean near Guadeloupe in a somewhat diminished state.
Still, by the time Georges left Cuba four days and 1200 miles (1900 kilometers) later, even the usually stoic National Weather Service was calling Georges "the hurricane that just won't die."
A high pressure system dubbed the Bermuda High kept Georges on its destructive east to west track, said meteorologist Jim Lushine at the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.
So instead of striking an island or two and then spinning northward out of the region as hurricanes generally do, Georges hit again and again.
It smashed public housing in Antigua, swamped the beaches of Guadeloupe and splintered the glass walls of St. Kitts' new airport terminal.
"Hurricane mash up my life," Verna McHenry said through tears while she picked through the soiled, sodden remains of her home on Antigua.
In Puerto Rico, where three people were killed, the squatter community of Diamond Point kept its dazzling hilltop view of the sea but little else.
Georges smashed its dozens of squatter homes.
In its wake, strangers and neighbors banded together to clear debris, stand in tedious lines for ice, water, propane and batteries and carry food to the needy.
Crossing the Mona Passage, Georges bore down on Hispaniola, an impoverished island of 15 million shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
Its substandard housing proved no match for 110 mph (177 kph) winds, and emergency officials seemed unprepared for the disaster.
Fed by up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, rivers swelled into mile wide (1 1/2 kilometer wide) torrents that swamped villages, entombed dozens of people under tons of mud in a Dominican shelter and left thousands stranded for days.
Helicopters had to drop food rations to survivors.
In Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital, officials opened some shelters only after Georges was pelting the city with sheets of rain and dangerous flying debris.
"They were overconfident," said Hugh Parmer, head of disaster relief for the U.S. Agency for International Development.
"When the thing hit, they were totally unprepared to respond."
The United States shipped more than dlrs 500000 of supplies, including plastic sheeting to roof thousands of homes.
U.S. helicopters are helping deliver supplies to victims.
Authorities also seemed unprepared in Haiti, where heavy rain flooded the Artibonite Valley, the country's breadbasket.
"We're trying to save what we can," said farmer Jean Roberto Jean Baptiste, working in a flooded rice paddy.
Georges left Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation, utterly dependent on foreign aid to help storm victims.
The Dominican Republic, considered one of the region's up and coming economic and political players, suffered a blow to its development.
Fidel Castro seemed relieved in Cuba, where only five people were killed after evacuations to safe zones.
"The first victory was to reduce the losses," Castro proclaimed.
The same can't be said for the Dominican Republic.
Asked how many people died in his country, the Dominican health undersecretary, Victor Terrero, replied: "I'll confess something to you.
I have no idea."
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico In many ways, the capital of Puerto Rico does not look strikingly different from cities in the 50 states like Miami, Houston and parts of New York.
There are plenty of modern new office buildings, condominiums and fast food places.
And, just as in those other cities, Puerto Rico has lots of modest neighborhoods, away from the modern facades, with people who are just getting by.
But Hurricane Georges, which hit the island last month and caused several billion dollars in damages, has brought out one big difference: while nearly every home in the 50 states is insured, insurance executives and government officials estimate that only 30 percent or 40 percent of those here are covered.
The result is that much of the cost of Hurricane Georges in Puerto Rico will not be shouldered by insurance companies.
Instead, it will be borne mostly by the people of the island and the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington, using tax dollars collected everywhere but here, because under Puerto Rico's special commonwealth status, its people do not pay Federal taxes.
"There's a different kind of insurance here," said Lemuel Toledo, a broker and consultant who has been in the insurance business for nearly 30 years.
"It's called Federal aid."
While mainland insurers are expected to spend six times what the federal government does for damage from Hurricane Georges in the Gulf Coast states, the government will spend just as much in Puerto Rico as the insurers do: about $1.7 billion each.
"Unfortunately, every time a storm hits an area that is uninsured, or underinsured, taxpayers have to come in and foot much of the bill," said Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group in New York.
And something else is increasing federal costs from hurricanes both here and along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.
Insurers, reeling from heavy losses from previous hurricanes, have raised their deductibles to 2 percent of the amount of coverage, up from the old standards of $250 or $500.
For a $100000 policy the deductible is now $2000.
One condo complex on the beach here with $25 million in coverage has a deductible of $500000.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency says that people with big deductibles who need emergency repairs to live in their homes can get government help, and that many homeowners and condo associations may be eligible for federally subsidized loans.
The reason many people in Puerto Rico do not have insurance on their homes, officials and insurers here say, is mostly a matter of money.
While there are plenty of expensive houses and limousines on the island, most people have little money.
Annual income averages $8500, less than half the average in Mississippi, the poorest state.
But in Mississippi, the majority of homeowners has mortgages and is required by banks to buy insurance.
Here, people often build modest homes without mortgages sometimes worth less than $20000, and they frequently go without insurance.
Moreover, when people here buy insurance they most often buy bare bones policies that do not cover furniture or theft.
But other reasons also account for the difference.
Not only do most poorer Puerto Ricans count on federal aid to bail them out of disasters, they are also victims, consumer advocates say, of insurers here who essentially ignore lower income homeowners to concentrate on wealthier clients whose homes are sturdier and who buy policies with higher premiums.
That practice, they say, is a form of discrimination often referred to as redlining, a term that grew out of the practice now outlawed by insurance companies and banks in places like Philadelphia, Detroit and New York of drawing red lines on maps around neighborhoods they decided to exclude.
Indeed, in the poor neighborhoods on the outskirts of San Juan, people say insurance salesmen never come calling.
Residents say they do not really understand insurance and they assume they cannot afford it.
In the town of Toa Baja, Tanya Davila sat in a kitchen chair in the shade of her concrete and wood three bedroom house, waiting for a representative of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Hurricane Georges ripped off most of her house's tin roofing and most of her belongings were ruined.
The house, Ms Davila said, is worth about $50000.
"It never occurred to me to buy insurance," she said.
"Nobody ever came to talk to us about insurance."
Ms Davila, 42, said she did not know anyone who had homeowner's insurance.
"People don't buy disaster insurance because they know the government is going to take care of them," she said.
"If I can get something for free, why pay for it?'
That's not my opinion.
But that's the way a lot of people think."
In a section of neatly kept homes in the nearby town of Catano, Petra Gonzalez, 78, said she was hoping that FEMA would repair the roof on her $25000 wood and tin house.
"I didn't build this house thinking the government would take care of me if something happened," she said.
"I never imagined anything like this could happen.
That's the truth.
I'm a poor person.
I'm an elderly person.
My husband is gone.
If the government doesn't help me, there's nothing I can do."
Some insurers and brokers acknowledged that it was difficult, if not impossible, to get insurance on the many inexpensive wooden houses in Puerto Rico.
Nor do insurers regard poor sections as prime markets.
"You'd rather deal with the upper middle class guy with a $250000 home and four cars than the guy with a $30000 home and one car," said Toledo, who now concentrates on commercial insurance.
"It takes the same amount of time, but there is so much more premium and so much more commission."
This is not redlining, Toledo contended.
"Redlining means somebody asks for insurance and you don't sell it," he said.
"But if nobody asks, you're not redlining."
Juan Antonio Garcia, the insurance commissioner of Puerto Rico, also sees no discrimination.
"This is a free competition market," Garcia said.
"The companies are at liberty to write whatever risks they want to write.
People either buy it or they don't.
I can't force them."
In the United States, J. Robert Hunter, the director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, said insurers had never publicly acknowledged redlining.
Yet several big companies have paid millions to settle suits accusing them of redlining and agreed to open offices in places where there had been no insurance sales force for decades.
"What's going on in Puerto Rico has all the characteristics of red lining," said Hunter, who has made several trips here to work as an adviser to the Puerto Rican government.
Jose J. Villamil, a Wharton educated economist who heads a consulting company, Estudios Tecnicos, which works with the government and private industry, said he did not believe that insurers were deliberately discriminating against the poor.
But Villamil said some of the remedies imposed in redlining lawsuits should be applied in Puerto Rico anyway.
"The government has a role to play in terms of putting pressure on the companies," he said.
"The companies should be more pro active in educating people about insurance and in providing access to insurance.
Maybe they should develop products more in line with people's capacity to buy insurance."
About a dozen companies, mostly Puerto Rican, sell insurance on the island.
Royal Group, a British insurer with more than 100 years of experience in the Caribbean, is among the leaders.
Only two big United States companies, Nationwide Insurance Enterprise and American International Group, sell homeowners' coverage in Puerto Rico, though Allstate Corp. is preparing to start selling here.
The difficulty of handicapping the risks on an island that lies in the path of hurricanes and in an earthquake zone, combined with the relatively small size of the Puerto Rico market at 3.8 million people, have kept the other big American players away, said Goldstein of the industry group.
"If insurers felt they could add to their bottom line," he said, "they'd be in there."
The insurance companies began imposing higher deductibles after Hurricane Andrew walloped southern Florida with $15.5 billion in insured losses in 1992.
To get regulatory approval for the change, insurers in the United States threatened to cut back on the number of policies they wrote.
In Puerto Rico, the insurers said that without the 2 percent deductible, the cost of reinsurance would force them to raise premiums beyond the reach of many.
Hunter, a former Texas insurance commissioner, said the high deductibles "may have been a necessary stopgap" immediately after Hurricane Andrew.
But the insurance companies could reduce the deductible now without harm to their profit margins, he said adding, "Reinsurance prices have come way down in the last two or three years."
In any case, Hunter said, consumers should be given the choice, as they are in some states, of accepting either the high deductible or paying higher premiums.
Jose de la Cruz Skerrett, a plaintiff's lawyer who has often opposed insurance companies in court, estimates that with the 2 percent deductible, 80 percent of the losses from Hurricane Georges in Puerto Rico will turn out to be uninsured.
For some condo owners, the high deductible means significant costs.
At the 13 story Solemar condominium on the beach in San Juan, Ivan Tort, president of the board, estimates damages at $60000 well below the $100000 deductible on the condo's $5 million policy.
So all the repairs are going to have to be paid by owners of the condo's 30 apartments.
"If you live on an island," Tort said, "it comes with the turf."
At the 403 apartment Condado del Mar condominium nearby, Luis del Valle is not so sanguine.
Del Valle estimates damage at $1.5 million.
But he says much of the building was unharmed and that the deductible now figured at $500000 should not be based on the total value of the complex but only on the affected areas.
"We don't think this is fair," del Valle said.
"Yes, we have a contract, but we believe there are some ambiguities.
We're going to court.
We're talking about a lot of money here."
The voice that haunts Bill Becker is a woman's, filled with fear, who dialed in the dark on Sept 25 as Hurricane Georges reached its 100 mph peak over the Florida Keys.
She was huddled in a closet, her house shaking, a phone in one ear and a portable radio tuned to WWUS FM, said Becker, news director of the station.
As water ran under his feet and chunks of concrete ripped out of the studio roof, Becker chatted with the woman and hundreds of others in the area.
"We were the only thing connecting these people," Becker said.
"They were describing the water rising.
They were asking, 'How high is it going to get?'
You could hear the howling of the wind in their phones."
In an industry dominated by group ownership and satellite fed formats with disembodied voices, the sound of neighbors holding hands on the air seems almost old fashioned.
"It was absolutely essential," said the Monroe County sheriff, Richard Roth.
"We wound up using that as our main source for supplying information."
Usually, WWUS, owned by Crain Communications of Chicago, is live only between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. with news and a flea market.
At 11 a.m. the station plugs in an oldies satellite feed from Westwood One and CNN newscasts.
But shortly after Georges arrived around dawn on Sept 25, with 30000 people still in the Keys, the station's general manager, Bob Soos, opened the phones.
Six lines jammed immediately.
At 10 a.m. the satellite dish blew away.
By noon an inch of water had turned the carpets into sponges.
Callers reported yachts floating in back yards.
"You couldn't show people you were scared, though I really was," Gene Michaels, the operations manager, said.
As night fell and the worst of the winds struck Key West, studio lights flickered.
Michaels played Don McLean's eight and a half minute long "American Pie," giving him time to suck up water with a shop vacuum.
He signed off at 1 a.m. as the hurricane headed for the Gulf Coast.
A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and injuring 155.
The fast spreading fire that broke out just a few minutes before midnight Thursday gutted the building and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened to a "gas chamber."
The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday evening.
Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the upper floor, the facility had approval for a maximum capacity of 150, Hans Carlsson, the detective leading the disaster investigation.
The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history.
In 1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
Police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases, 59 bodies were found at the scene and one other died later.
Of the injured, at least 57 were in intensive care, according to Sven Martinell, spokesman for the local medical authorities.
Police earlier had reported 65 dead, but backed off that figure Friday evening.
"The earlier information that police gave out was wrong," said Hans Carlsson, the lead detective in the case.
A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and injuring 162 others in Sweden's second largest city.
Police earlier had reported 65 dead, but backed off that figure Friday evening.
"The earlier information that police gave out was wrong," Hans Carlsson, the lead detective in the case, told a news conference.
Forensic experts examining heavily burned bodies were able Saturday to identify more of the 60 young people who died in a dance hall fire, but the catastrophe's most tormenting question was still unanswered.
How could it happen, what caused the flames that raced through a hall packed far beyond capacity, blocking one of the exits and forcing panicked teen agers to flee down the one remaining staircase and leap out of second story windows?
"As long as the technicians haven't established the cause of the fire, we don't know if it's arson or not," Goteborg chief prosecutor Ulf Noren said Saturday evening.
Earlier in the day, Noren had said it was a "50 50" chance that the fire was arson, prompting wide speculation that authorities had tracked down new clues.
But Noren later retracted the remark, saying he'd meant only that no possibilities were being excluded.
As investigators worked to find the cause, examiners identified another 22 of the bodies, bringing the total to 40, and officials said 49 people were released from hospital.
Of the 162 people who suffered non fatal injuries in the Thursday night fire, 76 remain hospitalized.
Most of the victims were immigrants or of immigrant parentage, from countries including Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Ethiopia and current and former Yugoslavia.
The first call alerting authorities to the fire was made in heavily accented Swedish and that, combined with noise and the caller's distress, delayed the fire squads' response by several minutes.
Per Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency services line said the call was so hard to understand that it took three minutes for workers to figure out what was going on and where to send fire trucks.
The first fire trucks and rescue squads were on the scene six minutes after the call was received, Ortarsen told a news conference.
He and other officials declined to comment on whether a quicker response could have saved any of the mostly immigrant victims.
But the minutes of delay felt endless to those caught in the terror of the fire and survivors have spoken angrily of what they saw as a slow and even obstructive response.
"No help.
No police.
No firemen," 17 year old Zuhir Hersi, one of the disc jockeys at the bash said Friday, hours after the blaze exploded.
"Just kids helping kids."
And once the squads arrived, the kids were then blocked from helping, they say.
"We could have saved more young people if only police hadn't stopped us," Mohanned Hussein was quoted as saying by the newspaper Expressen.
On Saturday, hundreds of people stood quietly outside the gutted building amid flowers and candles as they attempted to come to grips with catastrophe.
In the parking lot that a day before had been a tumult of ambulances and screams, mourners had laid a 30 meter long (100 foot long) pile of bouquets, candles and cards of remembrance.
The cards' inscriptions were brief "I will see you in heaven," "We miss you" and the people who stood reading them also had few words.
"I just wanted to show my sympathy.
I think about them.
There's nothing else we can do," said Caroline Ericsson, who didn't know any of the fire's victims.
"It's damn difficult," said Connie Mesfin, who said she lost a friend in the blaze.
Lasse Gustafsson, a former Goteborg firefighter severely disfigured in an explosion, also came to the club site to try to show the victims' relatives and friends that spirit can help them pull through despair.
"I can't give them hope.
Consolation is enough," he said, as people nearby cast uneasy glances at his scars.
Many of those injured in the blaze may have to endure similar shocked looks the rest of their lives.
Authorities say the explosive fire quickly raised the temperature in the hall to 600 degrees (1100 F).
The hall was packed far beyond its capacity.
Licensed to hold a maximum of 150, the hall held at least 250 and perhaps as many as 400 when the fire hit.
One of the two exit stairways was blocked by fire and there were conflicting statements from witnesses as to whether the fire came up the stairs from a lower level, or whether it spread there after breaking out in the second floor rooms.
The worst previous fire disaster in modern Sweden was in 1978 in Boraas, when 20 people died in a hotel fire.
Goteborg, Sweden's second largest city with about 435000 people, is 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Stockholm.
A panicky telephone call in poor Swedish was the first word that authorities got of a fire racing through a dance hall crowded with immigrant teen agers, delaying fire squads' response to the blaze that killed 60 and injured 162, officials said Saturday.
Per Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency services line said the call was so hard to understand that it took three minutes for workers to figure out what was going on and where to send fire trucks.
The first fire trucks and rescue squads were on the scene six minutes after the call was received, Ortarsen said at a news conference.

There's nothing else we can do," said Caroline Ericsson, who didn't know any of the victims.
For Lasse Gustavsson, having the right words wasn't as important as showing his face, severely disfigured in a fire.
The former Goteborg firefighter lost his ears, his eyelids and most of his nose in a gas explosion.
By showing up, he said, he wanted to show the victims' relatives and friends that spirit can help them pull through despair.
"I can't give them hope.
Consolation is enough," he said, as people nearby cast uneasy glances at his scars.
Many of those injured in the blaze may have to endure similar shocked looks the rest of their lives.
Authorities say the explosive fire quickly raised the temperature in the overcrowded hall to 600 degrees (1100 F).
The cause of the fire that broke out just before midnight Thursday remains under investigation.
Witness accounts have varied widely, with some reporting smoke coming from the cellar and others saying the fire appeared to start in the ceiling of the dance hall on the building's second floor.
The fire's quick spread has prompted speculation that it could have been set, but officials also say the explosive spread could have been because the fire had been burning undetected for some time.
What's known is that the hall was packed far beyond its capacity.
Licensed to hold a maximum of 150, the hall held at least 250 and perhaps as many as 400 when the fire hit.
The crowd was mostly teen agers and mostly immigrants or children of immigrant parents.
They had come for a dance organized by eight party arrangers whom police have not identified, the hall was rented by the organizers from the local Macedonian immigrant association.
Officials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationalities, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as well as people from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified Latin American countries.
Identifying the dead was a wrackingly slow process, forcing relatives and friends already exhausted with dread to wait for hours at hospitals.
Only 18 of the dead had been identified by midday Saturday.
"The identification is hard because they have no driver's licenses or other documents they were so young," said Kerstin Einarsson of Sahlgrenska Hospital, the largest in the city of 435000 residents about 300 miles (500 kilometers) west of Stockholm.
The worst previous Swedish fire disaster in modern history was in 1978 in Boraas, when 20 people died in a hotel fire.
A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and injuring 162 others in Sweden's second largest city.
Police earlier had reported 65 dead, but backed off that figure Friday evening.
"The earlier information that police gave out was wrong," Hand Carlsson, the lead detective in the case, told a news conference.
The fast spreading fire that broke out just a few minutes before midnight Thursday gutted the building and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened to a "gas chamber."
The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday evening.
Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval for a maximum capacity of 150, said Carlsson.
The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history.
In 1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
Police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases, 59 bodies were found at the scene and one other died later.
Of the injured, at least 57 were in intensive care, according to Sven Martinell, spokesman for the local medical authorities.
The building did not have sprinklers and was not required to have them, officials said.
The dance was attended mostly by immigrants or children of immigrants.
Police said the dead or injured represented at least 19 nationalities, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, along with people from current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified Latin American countries.
The Macedonian Association, which rents space in the building, had in turn rented the facility out to others for the dance, Carlsson said.
That person was not immdiately identified.
Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw the fire.
He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people, including a friend.
"His clothes had burned off.
His skin was red and bubbly," Atta said.
"Lots of kids were just screaming," he added at Hammarkullen Lutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims gathered.
"I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped.
They didn't even look down" beforehand.
Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursday and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue workers said.
The blaze was already consuming the building.
The building had just two exits, one of which was blocked by fire, city police technician Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying by the Swedish news agency TT.
"It was a panic," Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said, with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends.
Olin said there were indications that the fire could have been set.
"The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a normal fire," he said.
Goteborg is about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of the capital, Stockholm.
The crowd in the second story of the building contained mostly 13 to 18 year olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday weekend.
"A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave from school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible dimensions," the Goteborg city council said in a statement.
"Goteborg is today a city in shock."
Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited the fire site at midday and King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement of condolence.
Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when the blaze started with about 400 people inside.
"It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and loudspeakers fell to the floor," he was quoted as saying.
"It was chaos.
Everybody was trying to get out and people trampled on each other on the way to the exit,Others kicked out the windows and jumped out."
Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities.
The Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service to help transport the injured.
Anna Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them was difficult.
"Maybe you have teen agers yourself and know how they are , They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that of a friend who is a year older.
Girls don't carry their identification on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body," she said, according to TT.
Goteborg has about 435000 people.
Officials offered no word Sunday on what might have caused the dance hall fire that killed 60 young people, but reports of grim possibilities abounded in newspapers.
And while the officials were telling journalists that they had no answer to the technical question of why the fire happened, thousands of Goteborg's residents came to the fire site to lay flowers, light candles and grapple with the philosophical "why?" that plagues anyone gripped by tragedy.
"Why wasn't I there?" sobbed a young woman as she turned away from the 200 meter long (600 foot long) mound of bouquets and flickering candles that has grown outside the gutted building.
The hunger for any answer at all was apparent at an afternoon news conference when chief prosecutor Hans Carlsson was describing the investigation and used the Swedish word for "scene of the crime."
Journalists immediately barraged him with questions: Why do you use that word, does it mean the fire definitely was set?
"It was a slip of the tongue," Carlsson said.
"We have not arrested anyone.
We have no suspect."
"Such a fire site is considered to be a crime scene until the opposite is proved," said Ralf Johansson, head of the Goteborg police's technical division.
That is exactly what investigators have not been able to prove, and speculation that the fire was set ran high.
The newspaper Expressen reported Sunday that police were told just hours after the devastating blaze that one of the 162 injured claimed to know who set the fire.
The Aftonbladet newspaper reported meanwhile that several teens had been ejected from the dance shortly before the fire began, a detail raising the possibility that they might have set the blaze in revenge.
The newspaper also reported that one of the dance arrangers noticed that the fusebox for the dance's sound system had at least one fuse replaced by a nail.
Witness reports on how the fire started have given different versions.
Timur Sklyavov, 16, told The Associated Press on Sunday that he had been dancing near one of the loudspeakers and saw it explode.
He saidd his 15 year old girfriend died in the fire.
"I was dancing (by myself) so I didn't know where she was.
I feel guilty," he said, close to tears as he stood near the flowers and candles at the fire site.
"When I saw the fire, I ran out."
But the disc jockey has said he first saw smoke coming up the emergency exit stairway, located just behind where the sound system was set up.
It's known that fire blocked dancers from using that staircase, forcing panicked dancers to seek escape by fleeing for the one remaining stairway or leaping out of second story windows.
The hall was crowded to far more than its legal capacity of 150, witnesses have estimated the crowd as large as 400 people.
The fact that the emergency exit was burning "is a circumstance that indicates the fire could have been set," Johansson was quoted as telling the newspaper Aftonbladet.
Witnesses have said the emergency exit stairway was crowded with wooden furniture, Expressen reported.
Many of the victims were immigrants or children of immigrants.
The horror fell especially hard on the Shaker family: 12 year old Jasmin Shaker and her sister, 17 year old Meriam, both died in the fire and another sister, Shirin, 13, is hospitalized with injuries.
Meriam had escaped the blazing hall, but died when she went back in to try to save Jasmin.
Like the Shaker girls, many of the victims were immigrants from troubled countries, or children of immigrant parents.
"We left Iraq 18 years ago.
We didn't want our children to grow up with war and bombs.
And then this happens," the girls' uncle, Hassan Bakir, was quoted as saying in Expressen.
GOTEBORG, Sweden They were teen agers whose parents had brought them here from homes torn by war or terror from Bosnia, Eritrea, Somalia and others and in their new country they formed new bonds, through school and music and parties.
About 65 of the young people died and more than 190 were seriously injured late Thursday night when fire and smoke engulfed an overcrowded makeshift discotheque that had only one unlocked door.
The fire was the deadliest this country has seen in decades, and it was all the more painful because it highlighted the profound divide between native Swedes and the rainbow of immigrants who have found refuge here over the decades.
Almost all of the victims were teenagers between the ages of 13 and 17, who had packed into a Halloween hip hop party at a hall owned by a Macedonian civic organization.
Most of the victims died from smoke inhalation as they trampled each other in a panicked attempt to escape, but others were scorched by the heat.
Firefighters and police said they still had not determined the fire's cause.
Though its explosive speed initially led investigators to suspect arson, later Friday they said evidence pointed to electrical short circuits in the lighting or sound systems.
"We were dancing and then suddenly people were screaming and running and pushing," said Sara Afeworki, 15, who came here from Eritrea six years ago.
"There were two exits, but the one in the back was covered up.
The only way out was a small door at the front, and there were 400 people."
At candlelight memorials outside the discotheque, and at local hospitals, Kurds found themselves clinging in grief to classmates from Romania, Uganda and many other places that refugees have fled in the last 20 years.
Survivors described watching their friends jump from the windows on the building's second floor.
Others, who managed to get out the door, recalled a horrifying chaos within the building as they found themselves choking and clawing their way toward fresh air.
"It the most frightening thing I have ever been through," said Arya Shafai, a 15 year old Iranian, as he recuperated in a bed at the nearby Salgrenska Hospital.
Arya said he would probably not have escaped, except that three larger teen agers managed to pull him out from a mass of collapsed bodies around him.
The boy who came to the party with him, Gilsad, never got out.
"He was just so small, you know," said Arya, his voice trailing off.
Survivors and police officials said the hall had been rented out by a group of Kurdish students, who organized a hip hop party and charged an entrance fee of about $5.
The hall was not supposed to hold more than 150 people, about 400 were inside when the fire broke out shortly before midnight.
Many of the dancers, including Arya, said they saw a lamp exploding just before the panic began.
Others said they had seen a speaker fall over and appear to be malfunctioning.
Disk jockeys quickly began urging people to leave the building, but survivors said the hall was so crowded that the teenagers had little idea at first about what was happening.
"Somebody said something about tear gas," said Andrea Guajardo, a 15 year old Chilean girl who had come with her Iranian classmate, Yusra Morabet.
"We got out of the building and thought things were actually okay.
Then we looked up and saw people banging on the windows of the second floor and then trying to jump out."
When police and rescue workers showed up a few minutes after midnight, they found many young people relentlessly holding onto companions who had collapsed or even died in the parking lot.
"Young people were holding onto dead and dying friends," said Sten Schaaf, a police officer who coordinated part of the rescue operation, which lasted until about 5 a.m. Friday.
"In such situations, you just can't tear them apart."
Swedish Prime Minister Goren Persson toured the charred remains of the discotheque this afternoon and came out visibly shaken.
"It was all burned out, with only a skeleton left," he told Swedish reporters.
"On the floor were shoes and boots boots just like our children have.
It was only then that you could really understand what happened."
Birgitta Bahl, speaker of Sweden's Parliament, noted with particular sadness that the tragedy had befallen people who had come to Sweden in the hope of escaping violent death.
"It is especially moving that many of the families who lost their children had come here to seek refuge from violence and suppression," Ms Bahl said.
Swedish officials quickly set up psychological counseling centers around the city Friday, and churches in almost every neighborhood held bereavement services this evening.
Yet chaos and confusion continued to dominate efforts at picking up the pieces.
Officials said Friday night they had only been able to positively identify a handful of the dead teen agers so far, because many of partygoers either had no identification cards or false ones with false ages.
As a result, many dazed students and parents wandered around the hospitals here fearful that missing friends or children had died but unable to know for sure.
Police officials said it may be several days before they know the names of every victim.
After clinging to life for three days, two youths trapped in a dance hall fire died early Monday, bringing the death toll in the inferno to 62.
With another 17 people still in intensive care, the figure could still go higher in what is already Sweden's worst fire disaster of modern times.
The dead, as young as 12 and none older than 20, were among an estimated 400 people who were at a disco dance in a rented second floor hall when an explosive fire broke out shortly before midnight Thursday.
The hall had been rented out for the night by the tenant, the local association of Macedonian immigrants, to teen agers who arranged the dance.
The hall had a legal capacity of only 150 and officials say it is possible that the arrangers who allowed the hall to be severely overcrowded could be charged with contributing to others' deaths.
"It's important that people have a clear understanding that the authorities' approval of the premises was not a joke," chief prosecutor Ulf Noren, who is leading the fire investigation, was quoted as saying in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter.
However, Noren said, a decision on that question would wait until the cause of the fire has been determined.
The fire's ferociously quick spread has prompted wide speculation that it was set.
But witnesses have given widely varying accounts some saying it appeared to start in the equipment used by the disc jockey and others saying there was smoke coming up fom the emergency exit's stairway before the flames raced through the hall.
The emergency exit was blocked by flames, forcing the panicked dancers to try to flee down the one remaining stairway or leap out of second story windows.
Most of those at the dance were immigrants or children of immigrant parents.
Officials offered no word Sunday on what might have caused the dance hall fire that killed 60 young people, but reports of grim possibilities abounded in newspapers.
And while the officials were telling journalists that they had no answer to the technical question of why the fire happened, thousands of Goteborg's residents came to the fire site to lay flowers, light candles and grapple with the philosophical "why?" that plagues anyone gripped by tragedy.

"We left Iraq 18 years ago.

Goteborg, with 435000 is Sweden's second largest city, on the country's west coast some 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Stockholm.
Hundreds of teen agers jammed into an upstairs hall planning to dance the night away, but by the time the sun rose Friday they were dead, clinging to life in hospitals or weeping in disbelief at a fire that killed 67 of them.
Police said another 173 people were injured, 20 of them severely, in the explosive fire that engulfed the plain brick two story building just before midnight Thursday and turned a boisterous disco dance into a screaming terror in a matter of moments.
Bent metal bars on some of the hall's windows showed the panic fueled strength that the teen agers, many of them immigrants, exerted as they sought ways out of the hall, which with some 400 people inside was crowded to more than twice its legal capacity.
Below the second floor windows lay stray shoes, broken glass and bloody blankets used to wrap those who may or may not have lived.
"I've been crying all day.
I haven't been able to sleep.
I'm alive, so why should I sleep when my friends are dead," 17 year old Alina Turk said as she stood outside the ruined building Friday afternoon.
She said she had been at the dance and two male friends of hers died.
Zuhir Hersi, the 17 year old disc jockey at the bash, told of his ordeal in telegraphic bursts.
"Panic.
No help.
No police.
No firemen.
Only kids helping each other," he said from his bed in a Goteborg hospital.
Although Hersi, like many of the youths at the dance, believes the police and firemen were slow, authorities said the first fire trucks were on the scene within five minutes of getting the alarm.
But the fire spread so fast that even an instant response would likely have been too slow.
The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday evening.
Fire Brigade Engineer Bo Wahlstroem said the flames' quick, raging spread could indicate arson, or that the fire had burned undetected for a time before exploding.
The fire destroyed the building, whose second floor, where the dance took place, was rented by the local Macedonian immigrant association in Sweden's second largest city.
The association had hired out the hall for the night to eight party arrangers, police said but declined to identify the arrangers.
The crowd was mostly aged 13 to 18, witnesses said, and consisted mostly of immigrants or children of immigrant parents.
Officials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationalities, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as well as people from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified Latin American countries.
Identifying the dead was a wrackingly slow process, forcing relatives and friends exhausted with dread to wait for hours at hospitals.
Some were able to make the wait in rooms off limits to journalists, but many had to wait in corridors, crying and teen agers hurry in and out of rooms as they looked for their pals.
Only 14 bodies had been indentified by Friday evening.
"The identification is hard not only because of the burns but also because they have no driver's licenses or other documents they were so young," said Kerstin Einarsson of Sahlgrenska Hospital, the largest in the city of 435000 some 500 kilometers (300 miles) west of Stockholm.
The blaze, the worst fire disaster in Sweden's modern history, shocked a country renowned for its smooth calmness.
King Carl XVI Gustaf, on a trip out of the country, sent a statement reassuring victims' relatives that "all of us in Sweden feel great sympathy."
Prime Minister Goeran Persson travelled from Stockholm to the fire site, first laying flowers outside and walking into the gutted wreck.
"The floor was full of shoes and boots, the same kind of boots my own children wear," he said.
On Friday evening, about 1500 mostly young people, came to the Goteborg Cathedral to try to assuage their grief and bewilderment at a memorial service.
The youths were dressed in the same sort of hip hop garb that the dance goers had worn, but listened to delicate hymns instead of pounding disco.
They wept, they embraced, and some looked around nervously, apparently not knowing how to behave in a church.
"I don't go to church.
I'm a Muslim, but I don't go to prayers," said a young man who gave his name only as Sami.
"I'm accompanying my Christian friends.
We lost someone.
We're mourning that's all."
Israel is not involved in any way in the current, growing confrontations between Turkey and Syria, a spokesman said Saturday.
"Israel is not a part of this dispute and is not involved in it in any way," said Defense Ministry spokesman Avi Benayahu.
Turkey has amassed troops on the border with Syria and warned of a military confrontation following allegations that Syria is supporting Turkish Kurdish rebels.
Damascus in respoonse has accused Turkey and Israel of contriving against Syria through their increased military cooperation.
Israel and Turkey signed military accords in 1996 that outline joint defense maneuvers and grant Israel the use of Turkish air space.
Israeli experts say they doubt the relations with Turkey are such that either army would defend the other in the event of confrontations with a third party.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak arrived Saturday for a one day visit to discuss regional problems with Saudi King Fahd and other high ranking officials.
The talks will focus on the Middle East peace process and the recent military tensions between Turkey and Syria over Turkish allegations that Syria is harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels, diplomats said.
The two leaders also will discuss the U.N. air embargo on Libya, said the diplomats on condition of anonymity.
The embargo is aimed at forcing Libya to hand over for trial two suspects wanted for the 1988 bombing of an American jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
This is the first time that Fahd, who is in his mid 70s, is meeting with a foreign leader since undergoing surgery Aug 12 to have his gallbladder removed.
Fahd's half brother, Crown Prince Abdullah, handled the kingdom's day to day affairs during the king's hospitalization.
The Turkish government, which sent about 10000 soldiers into northern Iraq to attack Kurdish rebels, has said it might send forces into Syria to eradicate guerrilla bases there, according to news reports.
Turkey's incursion into northern Iraq on Friday followed two days of airstrikes against suspected rebel bases, the daily Hurriyet said Saturday.
Turkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey wage cross border raids from camps in Iraq, Iran and Syria.
The Ankara government accuses Syria of aiding the rebels, a charge Damascus denies.
Turkey warned the Syrian government Friday that its "patience was running out," and Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, chief of the general staff, has described the mounting tension with Syria as "an undeclared war."
Fueling tension between the two countries are Turkey and Israel's expanding military and diplomatic ties.
Syria claims the ties are a threat to the Arab world, and on Saturday, Damascus again accused Turkey of plotting with Israel to undermine Syria.
In Jerusalem, Israeli Defense Ministry spokesman Avi Benayahu on Saturday denied his country was involved "in any way" in the looming Turkey Syria confrontation.
In an effort to head off a military conflict, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew to Damascus on Sunday for talks with Syrian President Hafez Assad and was expected to visit Turkey on Monday.
On Saturday, he traveled with Foreign Minister Amr Moussa to Riyadh for talks with Saudi officials.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt will go to Syria and Turkey to help cool tensions between the two countries, which appear to be edging toward a military conflict, a top Egyptian official said Saturday.
Mubarak "will head within the next few hours to Syria and Turkey to hold discussions," Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said in Riyadh where Mubarak met with Saudi King Fahd earlier.
Turkey has reportedly massed troops and armored vehicles along its border with Syria after stepping up its accusations in recent days that Syria is supporting Turkish Kurdish rebels.
Syria denies sheltering the rebels and in a government statement Saturday confirmed "its keenness for good neighborly relations with Turkey" as well as its readiness to solve every issue through "diplomatic ways, in an atmosphere of trust."
Earlier Saturday, Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said his forces would soon carry out an exercise near the Syrian border.
CAIRO, Egypt In a sign of Arab concern over growing tensions between Turkey and Syria, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew on short notice to Syria on Sunday in an effort to defuse what is being portrayed in the Middle East as an unsettling crisis.
Mubarak met with Syrian President Hafez al Assad and was expected to renew his mediation bid on Monday by traveling to Ankara, the Turkish capital, for meetings with top officials there.
Turkish officials have accused Syria of allowing the country to be used as a base for Kurdish rebels who have been fighting for self rule in southeastern Turkey.
Official newspapers in Syria have denied the contention and have called for talks to end the dispute, as did the Syrian and Egyptian foreign ministers after their meeting Sunday.
The differences between the two countries include a territorial dispute and arguments over Turkey's diversion of water from the two rivers that flow into Syria.
A military conflict between Syria and Turkey is still considered remote, Egyptian officials said Sunday night.
But a Turkish warning that differences with Syria had reached the stage of "undeclared war" has prompted worries that if clashes began, they might spread.
"This is a fire that has been smoldering for a long time, but it has now reached the point at which it wouldn't take a whole lot more to turn it into a real blaze," a diplomat from Cairo said.
In this region, at least, the situation is considered explosive because of Turkey's new and friendlier relations with Israel.
The two countries signed a military cooperation agreement in 1996 and have conducted several joint exercises.
A number of Arab newspapers have suggested that Turkey's alignment with Israel may lie behind its toughened stance toward Syria.
A typical editorial, published Sunday in the independent al Khaleej newspaper in the United Arab Emirates, said that it was "notable that the sudden Turkish escalation has come in the framework of the military alliance with Tel Aviv, whereby Syria is placed between the hammer and anvil."
Israel, for its part, has taken pains to distance itself from the crisis, saying it plans to scale down its military activity along its border with Syria to signal that it is not a party to the dispute.
The Arab League, which last month formally condemned the Turkish Israeli ties, issued a statement Sunday saying that the tensions between Turkey and Syria represented "a blatant threat to the security and stability of the region."
But only Iraq among Arab countries has explicitly criticized Turkey for the hard line that it has taken against Syria.
Although Turkey has repeatedly stated its willingness to accept a diplomatic solution, its official statements have also maintained a vaguely threatening air.
"I am not only warning Syria, I am warning the world," the Anatolia news agency quoted President Suleyman Demirel as saying Sunday.
"This cannot continue.
We are in a position of self defense.
The situation is serious.
Turkey has suffered for many years, and it no longer wants to suffer."
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew here on Sunday to try to defuse growing tension between Syria and Turkey.
Mubarak was met at the airport by Syrian President Hafez Assad, and the two leaders drove straight to Assad's palace for talks.
The talks come as Turkey has massed forces near the border with Syria after threatening to eradicate Kurdish rebel bases in the neighboring country.
In a show of force on Friday, Turkish jets buzzed the Syrian frontier, a Turkish daily reported.
Mubarak had made an unannounced trip to Riyadh on Saturday to get backing from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for his mediation efforts.
Egypt, the Arab world's largest country with 60 million people, frequently tries to mediate Arab and Muslim disputes.
"We have to stop the tension and contain it, and military threats should stop," Mubarak told Egyptian reporters on Saturday.
"I am ready to exert every effort in this direction in Damascus and Ankara."
Turkey's Foreign Ministry said Mubarak also was expected in Ankara, possibly on Monday.
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who accompanied Mubarak to Saudi Arabia and Syria, said Mubarak had consulted by phone on Saturday with Assad and also conveyed a message to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel through Turkey's ambassador to Egypt, Yasser Yakis.
Turkey long has accused Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, who have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for the Kurdish population in southeastern Turkey.
Late last week, Turkey sent 10000 troops into northern Iraq to hit bases that Turkish Kurds use for their uprising.
Damascus denies sheltering Kurdish fighters.
A government statement Saturday confirmed Syria's "keenness for good, neighborly relations with Turkey" as well as readiness to resolve disputes "in diplomatic ways, in an atmosphere of trust."
For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
Damascus also accuses Turkey of building a series of dams on the Euphrates River that threaten to reduce Syria's water supply.
Signaling it does not want to be involved in any potential military confrontation between Syria and Turkey, Israel is limiting routine exercises along its own border with Syria.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also stressed Israel's hands off approach to the escalating dispute between Damascus and Ankara.
"We have no part in this tension," Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem on Sunday.
"We have taken steps to reassure Syria."
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai instructed the army to limit military maneuvers along Israel's border with Syria to avoid giving any impression Israel is poised to act. "Israel is not interested in confrontation with Syria, but rather in finding ways to renew talks," Mordechai's office quoted him Sunday as saying.

"I am ready to exert every effort in this direction in Damascus and Ankara."
Turkey's Foreign Ministry said Mubarak also was expected in Ankara, possibly on Monday.
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who accompanied Mubarak to Saudi Arabia and Syria, said Mubarak had consulted by phone on Saturday with Assad and also conveyed a message to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel through Turkey's ambassador to Egypt, Yasser Yakis.
Turkey long has accused Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, who have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for the Kurdish population in southeastern Turkey.
Late last week, Turkey sent 10000 troops into northern Iraq to hit bases that Turkish Kurds use for their uprising.
Damascus denies sheltering Kurdish fighters.
A government statement Saturday confirmed Syria's "keenness for good, neighborly relations with Turkey" as well as readiness to resolve disputes "in diplomatic ways, in an atmosphere of trust."
For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
Damascus also accuses Turkey of building a series of dams on the Euphrates River that threaten to reduce Syria's water supply.
About 10000 Turkish soldiers have crossed into northern Iraq to attack Kurdish rebels, and the government said it might send forces into Syria to eradicate guerrilla bases there, news reports said Saturday.
Turkey's incursion into northern Iraq on Friday followed two days of airstrikes against suspected rebel bases, the daily Hurriyet said.
Turkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey wage cross border raids from camps in Iraq, Iran and Syria.
The Ankara government accuses Syria of aiding the rebels, a charge Damascus denies.
In an effort to ease escalating tension between Syria and Turkey, Egypt said Saturday that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will travel to Damascus and Ankara for talks.
Necati Utkan, the Turkish foreign ministry spokesman, told the Anatolia news agency that Mubarak was expected to arrive in Ankara on Monday.
He did not elaborate.
The military did not return calls for comment.
The rebels, fighting for an autonomy in southeastern Turkey, stage hit and run attacks from bases in Syria, Iraq and Iran.
On Friday Turkey strongly warned Syria that its "patience was running out," and Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was quoted Saturday by the daily Hurriyet as saying, "the soldier is awaiting an order."
But an intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Saturday that the troop deployments were not targeting Syria, but infiltrations of Kurdish rebels.
Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, chief of the general staff, has described the mounting tension with Syria as "an undeclared war" amid unconfirmed reports of troop deployments along the Turkish Syrian border by both sides.
According to daily Cumhuriyet on Saturday, the military has reinforced its units near the border town of Reyhanli, with an artillery, an engineer and an infantry battalions.
On Saturday, Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said Turkey would soon carry out an exercise near the Syrian border, private NTV television reported.
Turkey has never conducted wargames along the Syrian border.
The exercise was expected to follow current NATO maneuvers, running in an area close to Syria through Oct 21.
In a show of force, Turkish jets buzzed along the Syrian border on Friday, daily Radikal reported Saturday.
Hurriyet newspaper said the Turkish units also sealed the escape routes of the rebels along the Syrian Iraqi border inside northern Iraq.
Sezgin said Turkey was still trying to use diplomatic means to solve the problem.
"But there is a limit of patience," NTV quoted him as saying.
"Then we will do whatever necessary."
Damascus denied the allegations and accused Turkey of plotting with Israel to create a crisis with the aim of undermining Syria.
In Jerusalem, Defense Ministry spokesman Avi Benayahu said Israel is not involved "in any way" in the Turkey Syria confrontation.
ISTANBUL, Turkey Tension between Turkey and Syria has risen to the point where the top Turkish military commander says the two hostile neighbors have reached "a state of undeclared war."
"We are trying to be patient," said the commander, Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, "but that has a limit."
Syria has reacted angrily to Turkey's blossoming friendship with Israel.
It also makes territorial claims against Turkey and accuses Turkey of unfairly diverting water from rivers that flow through both countries.
For its part, Turkey is complaining ever more loudly about Syria's support for Kurdish insurgents in Turkey.
The insurgents are said to have bases in Syria, and their leader reportedly lives in Damascus.
Turkey and Syria are moving troops and equipment to border positions, according to news reports, but no outbreak of fighting is considered imminent.
"Intervention is out of the question," said Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin.
But he said, "If they continue to do so much harm, then naturally diplomacy will finish."
Turkish generals began issuing public warnings to Syria last month.
About the same time, during a visit to Israel, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz dismissed Syrian contentions that Turkey and Israel have sealed a "satanic alliance."
"I don't care about Syria's reaction," Yilmaz said.
"Syria's hostile attitude is obvious."
Asked if military ties between Turkey and Israel are based on shared hostility toward Syria, the prime minister replied, "If we are going to talk about hostility, then we need to look very closely at Syria's support for separatist terror in Turkey."
Turkey's military dominated National Security Council discussed problems with Syria on Wednesday, and announced afterward that Turkey was considering imposing "economic, political and military sanctions" against Syria.
The next day Turkish President Suleyman Demirel asserted that Syria "openly pursues a policy of hostility against Turkey."
Syria has denied supporting Kurdish rebels.
Last week the official Syrian newspaper Al Baath said Turkey's newly assertive position "is a result of full coordination between Ankara and Tel Aviv in accordance with their alliance."
Turkish military commanders are frustrated by their inability to crush Kurdish guerrillas, and have for years been sending units into northern Iraq to attack their bases.
They have never sent troops into Syria, a step that would be explosive.
"This could be a sign of military frustration with the civilian government," said a Middle Eastern diplomat posted in Turkey.
"For a while the military was saying they had won the war and that it was time for the civilians to step in and take over.
Apparently they weren't too happy with what the civilians did or didn't do, so now they're taking a new tack.
They want to raise the issue in preparation for something.
What it will be, they're keeping vague."
In another step in its new diplomatic offensive against Kurdish nationalism, Turkey has moved to improve its relations with Iraq.
The decision came after a deal brokered by the United States to bring two Iraqi Kurdish leaders together last month.
U.S. officials insisted that the deal was not intended to pave the way for a Kurdish state within a future Iraqi federation.
But Turkish leaders were not convinced.
They oppose federations or other arrangements in which Kurds rule themselves.
Turkey has recently suffered a series of setbacks in its diplomatic campaign to isolate Kurdish nationalists.
In August, local authorities in Lausanne, Switzerland, refused Turkey's request to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the signing of the Lausanne Treaty, which created modern Turkey, in the hall where the treaty was signed.
Kurdish groups had campaigned against the ceremony.
Soon afterward, a call from the guerrillas for a cease fire won praise in several European capitals, despite Turkey's refusal to consider it.
And last week a group called the Kurdish Parliament in Exile has been meeting in Rome with the support of politicians from Italy and elsewhere.
"Italy made a mistake," said Korkmaz Haktanir, a senior foreign ministry official.
"How can a NATO member state host a terrorist organization that threatens the unity and territorial integrity of another NATO member state?"
